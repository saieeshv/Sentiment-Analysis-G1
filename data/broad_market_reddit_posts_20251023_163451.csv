VTI,1o48yf4,Bogleheads,"Short, medium, and long term after a crash","I looked into what happened after the 2008 crash. I am just using SPY (S&P 500) and VDC (consumer staples) as examples here: you could use VTI or VT for broad market indexes and there are other ""stable"" sectors, like utilities, that this analysis should still hold true for. While both SPY and VDC fell in the crash, VDC fell less. While both recovered after the crash, VDC recovered a year and a half earlier. And while the S&P 500 has by far the better long term performance it took SPY well over a decade to catch back up to VDC. Bonds of course fell by less, holding their value better in the three years after the crash. VDC caught back up to BND in fall 2012, SPY caught back up to BND a year later. So there's three time ranges: - short term BND preserved spending power during and immediately - VDC recovered faster and provided better growth over the next ten years - long term S&P 500 dominates Therefore I'm thinking of allocating something like this: 40% VTI (VT if you want int'l) 30% VDC and similar 30% BND and similar (TIPS, bills) I think this might be better than 60/40 because it uses VDC to better fund the decade after a crash, and although VDC is slower growing, overall 70% equities is still pretty aggressive.

For our Roth IRAs (mine and my wife’s), we currently hold a mix of 20% VGT and 80 % VUG and plan on maxing this every year and thought about adding like 3-5% BTC. I know this is a bit tech-heavy and concentrated, but I work in the tech field and am okay with the added volatility in this smaller portion of our portfolio and will let it ride out and are okay with 20% dips. We just turned 30 and still feel comfortable with a higher aggressive tilt here, especially since it’s in our ROTH. For my SEP IRA, I’m hoping to contribute somewhere between $20k - $60k per year depending on how the work income looks. I’m currently deciding between keeping it super simple with VT, or splitting between VTI and VXUS to have more control over the US/international allocation. Thinking 70:30%. After going through this community I’m starting to like the simplicity of VT, but I also understand the flexibility of holding VTI and VXUS separately, so I’m open to guidance on that. Lastly, our emergency fund is also at Fidelity and parked in SPAXX. We’re keeping six months of expenses there, and our thought is to just let the interest sit and eventually use any overflow toward BND or another conservative option if it grows beyond what we need and add more once we get older. My goal is to stick with this plan long term and not overcomplicate things. I’d love feedback on whether this strategy makes sense for a hands-off, long-term approach, and if VT is a reasonable choice in the SEP IRA or if I’d be better off keeping the split with VTI and VXUS. Also open to any tax-efficiency tips for how we’re allocating across accounts. TLDR: Taxable: VTI Mine and my Wife's Roth: VUG / VGT, maybe BTC for fun.

VTI,1npk9m5,investing,Looking For Feedback On Brokerage Allocation?,"35M I made a post recently about being a little late to the game with Roth IRA accounts and just opened one not long ago. Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never. I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM. I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of 50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM. Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account. Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding. It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years. So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it. So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth. 35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks. currently my 401k is primarily VOO.

If so, is starting 401k now good for a target date of 2050 or am I too late??","I am 30 years old today. I just got into Bogle's little book of common sense investing. I love it. I am just now opening a 401k. I was a bad lad in life, never had no opportunities for 401k or other retirement. Finally kinda got my life together as a 30 year old. I'm setting up a 401k with my job, I'm starting a IRA which will automatically be taken from my paycheck as well, and then I'm going to start a two-fund portfolio of VTI and VXUS. At first, I thought I was smart to start my Roth IRA with VTI (70%) and VXUS (30%)... And my 401k with the same thing. Come to find out of course, my Roth IRA and two-fund portfolio are underway, I lay my eyes on the options for my 401k. ADMIRIAL? Target Date?? I then understood I was out of my element. I backed off, began to dig. Now I kind of understand. So, I was planning on utilizing the Rule of 55 at my company which offers it. As I am 30 today, that gives me 25 years to work things out. Am I being too optimistic to assume that I could retire via Rule of 55 and the funds from 401k, Roth IRA and 2-fund portfolio at that age? I planned on contributing 588 per month to my IRA, and same to my portfolio, 14 percent total going to my 401k. At that point, should I be putting my contributions to my 401k into a target retirement date fund for the year 2050? At 2055, I would be 60, which would be when I would look to cash out my IRA. Perhaps pumping all my money into Vanguard's target date 2055 fund would then be more optimal? I'm not sure what to do here.

VTI,1o1tlzd,Bogleheads,What is the end goal?,"I’m a 36 year old male planning to retire around 75, which means I have 40 years of investing ahead of me. No matter how many videos I watch or books I read, everything seems to point to index investing as the best approach for regular investors which I completely agree with. The advice to invest frequently and consistently for the long term makes sense to me. That said, if I’m planning to invest for another 40 years, wouldn’t it be better to focus on indexes like the S&P 100 (SP100), QQQ, or SCHG instead of something like VTI? These cap weighted indexes effectively ‘flush out’ weaker-\] performing companies over time, so theoretically, they’re self-cleansing. If that’s the case, what’s the point of investing in the Total stock market index? I understand that QQQ and SP100 might have assets with high valuations or bubbles that could eventually burst. However, if I stick to dollar cost averaging for four decades, wouldn’t these kinds of investments still outperform broader options like VTI in the long run? When I backtested performance from 1999 onward, I saw that QQQ significantly outperformed SPY over 26 years. I know past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns, but if we’re all betting on the growth of the U.S. economy, aren’t we essentially playing the same game? I also get the argument for diversification through VT or the inclusion of bonds for stability. But that aside, why would someone choose broad based funds like VTI or VOO over more focused options like SP100 or SCHG? Edit: Thanks everyone!

VTI,1o0qkkw,Bogleheads,Diversified funds with factor tilts,"Not a finance professional -- just an academic in an unrelated field and a curious DIYer posting this for discussion purposes. I’ve long thought the ICAPM provides an intuitively appealing framework for asset pricing, capturing investor heterogeneity and hedging demands. I am also sold on the the Fama–French factor models as solid empirically grounded ways of operationalizing ICAPM-like ideas (regardless of whether the expected returns associated with these additional factors truly reflect risk premia or some behavioral quirks/tastes of typical investors). Given this, I’ve been interested in the “Core” funds from DFA. What seems attractive is their built-in application of factor tilts across the full cross-section of stocks (e.g., value tilts across all size ranges, and size tilts across the value-to-growth spectrum and across sectors), rather than manually combining a market fund and small-cap-value fund to get tilts (e.g., VTI + a bit of AVUV). Historically, DFA’s funds were not accessible to DIYers, but now with the ETFs conversion with low expense ratios (about 0.15–0.20%), seem viable. Ran some basic regressions against the Fama-French 5 factors + momentum data from Ken French's website. Plot is attached showing estimated factor exposures and historical performance for some of these ETFs (net of expense ratios). I extended the timeline back to before the funds became ETFs by using the corresponding mutual fund tickers for that period (when known). Based on regressions, DFAC and DFAX appear to be reasonable subs for VTI and VXUS respectively in terms of market coverage, but with light-to-moderate factor tilts (betas around 0.2 for size, value etc.) if one is interested in getting exposures to those like I am. Thoughts? Caveats? DFUS was another interesting one to to see. While the regression makes it clear that it's just an index-fund (market beta of 1, zero beta for other factors), it still seems to have realized slightly higher returns (\~1% more) than VTI (at least in this short period). Any idea if this is just coming from some clever implementation choices given that they are not constrained to track an index too tightly or passively?",42,39,2025-10-07 20:39:55,https://i.redd.it/p9np2ly12rtf1.png,2025-10-23 08:24:53.918102,0.8,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999

VTI,1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :) I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people. I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion! **Portfolio Construction Rules** To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT. Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK. Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY. Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD. **So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD** Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure. **Reasoning** I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns. Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm. Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe). Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms... This leads to the value premium. However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed. Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns. However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices. We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love. Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time... Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts. The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion. For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation. I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own). It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500 It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade. The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed. So... What do you do about all of that? Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance. As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period. If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth."" Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%. To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns. Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index. Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do. However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above. **The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach. **Performance Analysis** Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like: MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio **Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR** **VT Return: 11.16% CAGR** Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems: We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult. This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT. Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy. For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it... **Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR** For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds. Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78% Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56% Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller. This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe. That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR** That's some significant outperformance! Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...) Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings. There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy... But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising **I know that was a long post... thanks for reading :)** **Thoughts?**",0,9,2025-09-28 03:30:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nse5u1/using_mgk_schd_and_schy_to_create_a_value_and/,2025-10-23 08:24:40.791750,0.6000000000000001,$VTI,0.8,[],"['earnings', 'dividend', 'rally', 'revenue', 'profit', 'split']",0.7342857142857142
VTI,1o5a1n7,Bogleheads,New investor advice,"Hi all, first time post here. I'm 25 and over the last few months I've started investing and absorbing as much knowledge as I can. I've decided on a buy and hold strategy and the portfolio allocations I'm leaning towards are heavily inspired by Bogle, JL Collins, and Paul Merriman. I've been grinding and putting 40% of my income into the market. I'll likely be raising my prices in the coming months so I'm hoping to bring that up to 45%-50% if my income. So my question is two fold. Is this aggressive enough to be able to retire in my late 40s? And does the below portfolio look strong? Thank you all!

VTI,1nsteob,Bogleheads,Staying the course - A quick analysis of how Vanguard strategies perform in a crash.,"I've been a Boglehead for around a decade now. During these wild economic times I felt the need to re-evaluate my allocations and do a bit of research to be sure my strategy makes sense. **TL;DR** The best approach turned out to be the same as the guides and Vanguard books I've always followed. For your investment dollars, choose a Lifestrategy fund using the typical 4 broad market funds (VTSAX, VTIAX, VBTLX, VTABX) that matches your risk tolerance and is based on how close you are to retirement, or go with a Target Retirement date if you know when you want to be more bond cautious and not need as much growth. **ANALYSIS**: The AI stock concentration appearing to be an economic bubble, rising wealth concentration is at levels nearing the roaring 20s, labor market is deteriating, inflation increases, dollar decline, and other factors have me very wary of a big correction in the next 2-5 years. I ran some calculations how this would go with a few scenarios to see if it matches the wisdom of the subreddit: * 3 fund approach **US total market + Total international + US total bond market** * 4 fund approach (Lifestrategy/Target Retirement which **adds International Bonds**) * 5 fund approach (Added 10% into VTIPS) * Compared Lifestrategy income, moderate and growth strategies to compare risks and returns. Thankfully, the results corroborated the general Boglehead guides. In general, the 3, 4 or 5 fund approaches had very little effect on the affect of the crash or returns at all. The difference was 1-2% for each crash with only .4% variation in 5 year annualized returns. As expected, the main difference is the stock/bond mix in regards to some sort of ""AI stock crash"" hitting mega cap and other markets. * Income (20/80) had a drawdown of -4%with faster breakeven in 2 years. * Moderate (60/40) had a drawdown -15% with a recovery in 3-4 years * Growth (80/20) had a drawdown of 21% with recovery in 4-5 years. However that just shows drawdown and breakeven without the focus on long term gains. So I compared the three fund mixes using the 2008 crash and focused on the 15 year return. This showed what matters. * Income (20/80) had a drawdown of -12%with 15 year return of 3.8% * Moderate (60/40) had a drawdown -25% with a 15 year return of 7.7% * Growth (80/20) had a drawdown of -40% with a 15 year return of 9.5%. As for risk, because Vanguard uses broad market funds it's fairly insulated against a Mega-cap crash instead of just making risky AI bets. VTI for example holds \~4k us stocks with mega, mid and small cap companies, across all major sectors. So, despite me believing strongly we're going to correct soon, it's clear no one is smart enough to know when that will occur and by trying to time that I miss out on all the gains. Basically, it appears best to pick the fund based on your target retirement dates or pick the Life Strategy and adjust as you approach retirement while riding out the volatility. Don't let the initial drawdown prevent you from getting those sweet growth gains. We can't plan for every scenario, and we can't predict the market, which is why we're all here anyway to be more passive while still making gains.That way, if you are close to retirement you get hit with a lower drawdown while not caring about the eventual bigger returns as you focus on stability, and if you have 15 years to retirement you get to ride out the heavier drawdown with a much larger 15 year return. Hope that helps some of you rest easier with a simple 4 fund Lifestrategy/Target Retirement Vanguard approach. **SOURCES:**[https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/top-1-percent-net-worth-meaning-130048547.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/top-1-percent-net-worth-meaning-130048547.html) [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9) [https://www.thinkmarkets.com/en/market-news/ai-stocks-surge-introduces-risk-of-seasonality-crash/#:\~:text=However%2C%20traders%20may%20draw%20more,out%20the%20dot%2Dcom%20bubble](https://www.thinkmarkets.com/en/market-news/ai-stocks-surge-introduces-risk-of-seasonality-crash/#:~:text=However%2C%20traders%20may%20draw%20more,out%20the%20dot%2Dcom%20bubble).

VTI,1o270sd,Bogleheads,Best way to move out of individual stocks,"I'm a 45 year old about 35% of my portfolio in individual stocks. Much of it is in concentrated in tech / AI companies. My stretch goal is to partially retire by 55. This year I finally made an investment policy statement and rebalanced my portfolio. As you might imagine, I'm heavily overweighted into tech stocks. Once you add in my VTI holdings, around 50% of my portfolio is in tech. Psychologically I'm finding it a little tough to sell these for two reasons: the tax hit, and the performance gap. My brokerage volatility is quite high on a day to day basis, but this batch of stocks is up 75% in two years in aggregate (after I sold the losers, so performance is overweighted). I'd like to gradually start selling off my individual stock holdings and moving everything to an index fund strategy. I'm curious to hear from others that have done this about the best. My rough plan: 1. \[Complete\] sell off underperforming stocks to take their losses 2. Sell off *highest performing stocks* first, up to the cap gains limit for 15% tax treatment 3. Sell the remainder stepwise until I'm completely transitioned out, without exceeding the 15% CG limit As for #2, the logic is that the highest performing stocks take the lowest tax hit in terms of my net gains versus expected gains, and they're also more likely to have higher volatility and potentially fall from greater heights.

I've been lurking this sub for a while and I never really had the money to make significant investments, but my situation changed and I want to set myself up for the future. I'm 24M living at home with my parents, no expenses besides gas/insurance, leisure, and additional food outside of what's cooked for dinner. I got hired at the post office so I left my old job, and was recently able to over my old employee sponsored 401k plan into a Roth IRA (my reasoning being that I'm in a low tax bracket and I'd know exactly how much I could pull out once the time comes). I don't come from much financial knowledge or success, I grew up and still live in a HCOL area (Long Island, NY) and I've seen what my parents have had to do to keep food on the table and while I greatly appreciate it, I don't want to put myself through the same type of stress. My first question is: What should I invest my IRA holdings in for the most amount of growth over the long term? From what I've learned, I'm assuming I can just buy all VT just to set it and forget it for a while as i continue to contribute, then down the line diversify my contributions for more stability. My goal is to retire as early as possible, and the fastest way to do that seems to be getting your money to work for you as much as possible. Since starting my new job, I cleared all my credit card debt and have a plan to pay off my student loans by the end of 2026. After that I don't have any debt and don't plan to incur any until I can start considering buying a house hopefully in the next 10 years. I buy my cars off Marketplace in cash so no worries about payments, pay my insurance policy in full so that it's a one time expense, and I've been adjusting my lifestyle to significantly cut down on leisurely spending and focus on investing in my future. My Roth has about $9k after the rollover, but most of it has been sitting uninvested the last couple days due to me not wanting to make a costly wrong decision or accidentally set myself back. Outside of my IRAs I've bought $1k in both VOO and VTI so that I'd at least be making something while I mull over the decision, any and all advice is greatly appreciated so thank you guys in advance!",22,18,2025-10-19 13:40:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1oapx46/vt_and_chillright/,2025-10-23 08:24:53.899833,0.5,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.7999999999999999

VTI,1odk5en,Bogleheads,Helping Retired In-laws (70s; $400k Portfolio w/ Pension) - allocation and risk mitigation advice!,"Hi all - I’ve found myself in an unexpected situation and was hoping to get some feedback as I help my in-laws with their finances. About a month ago, my mother-in-law asked me to step in because she’s unfamiliar with investing, and my father-in-law (who used to handle this) now has early Alzheimer’s. They’re both retired, mid-70s, living a simple life in California. They’re wonderful people, and I’ve been honored to help them even if it’s been a bit heartbreaking uncovering some poor advice they received over the years. I’ve spent the last month getting my head around their financial situation and uncovering the various accounts and assets/liabilities. I feel like I’ve finally found >95% of the big ticket items (though I’m sure other surprises are in store). Here’s a breakdown of their situation. ASSETS: * Home: worth $875K, mortgage \~$275K @ 3% interest * Rental home (in different state): owned outright and worth \~$125K * Currently rents for \~$700/month * Credit Union Cash: \~$40K * Retirement accounts: \~$400K total * TSP: $230k * Federal retiree account - currently 100% in the G Fund - essentially a Money Market Fund * Currently drawing $1,667/month ($20k/yr) * Traditional IRA: $12k * Roth IRA: $100k * Joint Taxable Brokerage: $80K * Unfortunately stuck in older mutual funds (ACAAX, KAUFX, TFFYX with unknown cost basis so I’m hesitant to liquidate and buy VTI, etc) INCOME: * Combined Social Security: \~$3,200/month * Federal Govt Pension: $2,366/month * California pension: \~$1,050/month * TSP Withdrawal: \~$1,667/month ($20k/yr) * Rental income: \~$700/month * Total Income: around $9,000/month, * Avg Monthly Spend: $8–9k/month HEALTH & TIME HORIZON: * Father-in-law: early Alzheimer’s, mild but worsening * Mother-in-law: multiple cancer survivor, health fragile * Life Horizon: I really hope for 5–10+ years, but it could realistically be less * If she passes first, memory care would be required and cost $8–10K/month, which is my biggest worry right now GOALS: 1. First, simplify and consolidate (thankfully almost done) 2. Preserve capital with minimal risk while not losing a ton to inflation/debasement (sadly this was not the case the last several years) 3. Be strategic about asset allocation with goal of earning modest growth above inflation without taking unnecessary market risk 4. Keep things easy for our family as their health continues to decline 5. Preserve flexibility if memory care or medical costs rise sharply BACKGROUND TIDBITS: * My FIL is very conservative by nature (hence the vast majority of his retirement savings in cash/MMF) and it was a multi-week endeavor to convince him to consolidate from 8 different custodians to 3, so keeping things conservative (despite my nature) so he remains comfortable is my guiding principle. * MIL is 100% trusting of my advice for the retirement accounts in her name. * I’m sure the moment I invest any cash, the market will crash - such is life. I’m fine with that, but it’s one reason I’m cautious. QUESTIONS: 1. What allocation makes sense given their age and situation 1. Initial thought was 80% cash and 20% invested? 2. Given their background, what is the recommended approach to allocation and risk in each bucket/account type? 1. My initial thought was to be more aggressive with a VTI type allocation in the Roth/traditional IRA accounts and to stick with the Money Market Fund G in the TSP. Does this make sense? 2. The TSP is currently 100% in the G Fund. Is that too conservative, or appropriate given their age and situation? 3. If memory care is needed in the future (or any higher level of medical care), would it make more sense to draw from the Roth accounts first, or take the tax hit on the brokerage accounts with the old mutual funds? I’m trying to play out the sequencing of what to liquidate first, and then use that to backwards plan the investment choices. 4. If I were going to invest the $100K in Roth funds, what options would you recommend? VTI? Target Date Fund? Other? 5. For the Roth/traditional IRAs, there’s about $62k in cash (also $10.5k in FDVV and $25.5k in FZROX). Since they can’t add cash to these accounts any more (no longer working), should they keep dry powder in cash for a downturn, or just invest to the allocation percentages we decide? 6. Any advice on handling the older taxable mutual funds? 7. What are the most common mistakes you've seen made when managing money for aging parents?

VTI,1nwc7w5,Bogleheads,When is it time to change your mindset from building your wealth to sustaining your wealth.  when is it time to buy that very first share of BND?,"TL;DR - When do you stop playing offense and start playing defense? Hey Bogleheads, longtime investor here, and been listening to the bogleheads podcast for years. Need some help from the Bogleheads community. So some background, my entire portfolio is pretty much all VT. My 401k is both VTI and VXUS equivalents, and my brokerage, IRA, HSA is all in on VT. I do this because I have been investing my entire adult life, I follow jack bogles principles by living below my means, investing heavily, and keeping the funds really low cost. I have read a couple of his books. As a millennial, I have been refraining of owning any bonds because I was always in the mindset of building my wealth. I grew up poor, and was always inherently fine with stomaching big market losses in order to continue to buy VT at a sale. Of course if I ever randomly experienced an enormous windfall, like winning the lottery, getting a huge inheritance, or striking oil, then I would obviously not be needing to build my wealth anymore and can just be fine with sustaining the wealth. At that point I would by all means be opting to a 50% stocks 50% bonds portfolio as Jack Bogle suggests. From there on out be financially free to do as I please. So this raises the question I have to the community at what point do you flip that switch? At what point do you have a large enough portfolio to start getting out of the mindset of building your wealth and start entering the mindset of sustaining your wealth. I don't believe it is necessarily a matter of age, but a matter of portfolio size. If you are 20 and have $10M, you should be sustaining wealth. If you are 60 and have $50k, then you should be building your wealth. If a man had a median income and was investing heavily into VT with each and every paycheck, and he got a raise that matched inflation to keep himself at the median all his working career, at what point in the portfolio size would he optimally go from 100% VT and enter the phase of 99% VT and 1% BND and start tickering off percent by percent until he reached a 50/50 portfolio.

DFUS as opposed to VTI is one such example if we want to talk about US total market funds. There is evidence that shows that index rebalancing is rather arbitrary and incurs some cost inefficiencies through adverse selection effects, price impacts on index reconstitution, and mean reversion.

VTI,1o24qzy,Bogleheads,All roads lead to VT?,"I internalize the Boglehead way as: Decide on a simple investment allocation in low-cost index funds and stick to/rebalance to that plan yearly regardless of performance because it could take 30+ years for US/Int’l cycles to play out. Stick to things you can control like a high savings rate and avoid the infinite FOMO of chasing market news. That said, VT automatically balances US/Int’l based on market cap. It’s easy to look at the past 10 years of poor performance and underweight International, and therefore go with a heavier US index and underweight international. People DIY’ing an allocation going 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 on VTI/VXUS for example. Isn’t that basically trying to predict the market in its own way, which is contra to the Boglehead philosophy? Again, easy to look at VT the past ten years and see it obviously underperformed VTI. But on a 30 year time horizon, who the heck knows? For transparency: I am on a ~ 30 year time horizon with retirement accounts. Thinking something like 75% VTI and 25% “tinker”, which could be VXUS, VUG, and maybe could contain some a small % of BTC. If I already had a large sum of money I would probably just coast with it in VT, but since I am in accumulation phase the desire is obviously to try to find a higher return. Is anything other than VT effectively gambling by saying “I know better” than the globally weighted index?

VTI,1o4mlb0,Bogleheads,Retiring in three years-which money to move and into what,"I‘m 63, my lovely wife is 56. I plan on retiring in early 2029 and her in 2032. Our plan is to then start taking SS. I currently have 90K in my Roth and 350k in a traditional IRA. I just changed jobs so the money in my 401k is trivial at this point, although I have a net contribution rate of 9% total. I was thinking every quarter until I retire I would transfer money into something less volatile than stocks so we have a cushion of a couple of years in case of a market downturn. I was thinking the some sort of Bond ETF in my traditional IRA. Or should I being doing something else? Here are some more details that I have stated in responses so far: We currently make a bit over 120K a year. We are expecting to collect about 4200/month, 50500 a year in SS when we start collecting in 2032. That amount is indeed assuming a 20% reduction in benefits. Right now we have about $1.2 million retirement funds and about 4 maybe five months of expenses in cash and non retirement funds. We have at about 250k in home equity, 45K left in principal and less than $240 a month in P&I at 3.25%. We don’t see the point of paying off our mortgage early at that rate. 1.5 million in assets should be doable by the time I retire but my lovely wife is still working. At 4% that is 60K a year. So when we both retire and start to collect our income will be pretty much replaced, under these assumptions. Aside from not saving for retirement anymore we will have lower auto expenses. I commute almost 60 a day. If we don’t go to one car there will still be a reduction in costs. When my lovely wife retires our vacation costs will drop because she is in education and we have to go on vacation at peak times. No kids. And we are 100% in stocks right now. A bit of VTI and the rest is S&P500 index funds except for a bit over 100 shares of CCL that we use for shipboard credit on cruises. My timetable is to retire in very early 2029. My lovely wife is aiming to retire in early 2032. We plan on collecting SS when she retires. I hope this helps.

I put all of my money into SPY and VTI, both of which have nearly doubled in the past 5 years. However, from speaking to my parents, it sounds like their money has not doubled in that timeframe (or anything close to that really). When I mentioned that VTI had nearly 7x'd since 2000, they seemed very surprised. My father mentioned that he has indicated to their manager that he prefers aggressive investments, and that every team he meets with the 'money manager' this person says they're 'beating the baseline'. My first reaction was that this seems negligent on the part of the money manager, or, at the very least that we should consider ditching them and just investing in SPY/VTI. I'm very confused what the 'baseline' could be other than SPY/VTI that they're consistently beating (but still only up 20 or 30% in the past 5 years). Am I missing something?

VTI,1o4tr7q,Bogleheads,Do any Bogleheads here actually try to time the market — even just a little — when you see real headwinds coming?,"I've been 100% VTI for awhile now at 39 years old. I know the standard Boglehead philosophy is: *“Stay the course, don’t try to time the market, nobody can do it successfully long-term.”* And I mostly agree. But I’m curious: **Does anyone here shift into bonds or cash when you feel a major downturn is brewing?** Or is that considered heresy? Some specific questions: * Have you ever shifted your asset allocation in advance of a market drop? * If so, what were the **signals** you relied on? Was it technicals, macro data, gut feeling, etc.? * And did it actually work out for you — or backfire? * If not… do you truly believe it’s *impossible* to time anything at all? I’m not talking about day trading or swinging wildly between stocks and bonds every month. I mean more like: >“Hey, valuations are stretched, inflation is rising, the Fed is tightening — maybe I’ll shift 10–20% into bonds or cash just in case.” So I’m opening this up as a **friendly, curious debate** — 👉 Is there *ever* a rational reason to move out of equities temporarily? Or is that a slippery slope to performance-chasing and emotional investing? Would love to hear real stories — wins *and* regrets — from people who’ve tried it. Let’s get nuanced here. Not trying to spark heresy — just thoughtful discussion.

As you can probably tell, I hammer my taxable the hardest and have been since I started working almost 2 years ago. I think I should pivot to maxing the 401k though for the tax benefits down the line, and of course maxing the Roth always, and any excess would go into that taxable brokerage. I’m not sure what my long term goals are but I think would like to retire early, maybe around 40-45 years old. What would be the best method here?

Is there a penalty? https://preview.redd.it/xyiagi08losf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f73d6e2dfc249756eedbdd40d47c7b6899a97736,3,5,2025-10-02 11:08:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/1nw0sk0/hsa_portfolio_question/,2025-10-23 08:24:55.641208,0.4,$VTI,0.5,[],[],0.6

I don’t love the options in Betterment. I’m tied between their “Core” offering and the “innovative technology” offering. Core has a mix of: SPLG VEA VWO SPMD SPSM and innovative technology offers: VTI (which I love and want to own more of) VEA FWD KOMP VWO The concern is innovative tech feels a little gimmicky and more tech heavy than I’d like but it does have VTI.
