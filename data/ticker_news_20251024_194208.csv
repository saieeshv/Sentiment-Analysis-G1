AAPL,"US stock market futures today: Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures drop as US-China trade tensions escalate — Tesla, IBM, American Airlines earnings jolt Wall Street sentiment",Technology,"Synopsis

US stock market futures today: Dow Jones futures fell 0.25%, S&P 500 dipped 0.03%, and Nasdaq futures slipped 0.01% early Thursday as US-China trade tensions spooked investors. Tesla dropped 3.04% after mixed earnings, while IBM plunged 7.14%. American Airlines gained 1.41% ahead of results. Bond yields held firm, with the 10-year at 3.98%. Markets now see a 96.7% chance of a Fed rate cut in October.

US stock futures slipped Thursday as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated. Tesla, IBM, and American Airlines shares moved sharply on earnings and guidance. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 88 points (–0.2%), while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded near the flatline, signaling a cautious Wall Street open.

Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 3% after reporting mixed third-quarter results — revenue rose 12% to $28.1 billion, but adjusted EPS of $0.50 missed the $0.55 estimate from LSEG.

IBM (IBM) tumbled 6% despite beating earnings expectations, as its software revenue matched forecasts instead of exceeding them.

More than 75% of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have beaten profit estimates, according to FactSet, but markets remain sensitive to guidance and margins.

In the previous session, the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, the Dow Jones lost 334 points (–0.7%), and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.9%, reflecting rotation away from high-valuation tech names.

Live Events

Traders also monitored policy developments. President Donald Trump confirmed that his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is “scheduled,” slightly easing trade tensions. But Washington added new sanctions on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow’s resistance to a Ukraine ceasefire.

Market strategist Chris Grisanti of MAI Capital warned valuations are now the “second-highest in a century,” comparing the environment to the dot-com bubble.

“The market is strong but stretched. Many stocks are being priced on 2030 or 2035 projections — just like in 1999,” he told CNBC.

Investors are eyeing Friday’s inflation report, which could steer the Federal Reserve’s late-October policy decision. Analysts expect a 0.25% rate cut, despite weak jobs data.

Fundstrat’s Mark Newton remains optimistic, predicting a sharp S&P 500 rally into month-end driven by AAPL and GOOGL breakouts.

US stock futures today:

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.25%, S&P 500 slipped 0.03%, and Nasdaq 100 edged 0.01% lower. The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.37% gain.

According to reports, the Trump administration is weighing new export restrictions to China targeting products made with or containing U.S.-developed software. Officials are also in talks with quantum computing firms about taking ownership stakes in exchange for federal funding — a move that could reshape tech oversight.

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) rose 0.0045% to $667.83, while the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) added 0.012% to $605.56 in premarket trading.

Market strategist Chris Grisanti of MAI Capital Management advised investors to rebalance portfolios, noting that U.S. equity valuations are at their second-highest level in a century.

“This feels like 1999 all over again,” Grisanti said, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble. He warned that “companies are now being priced on 2030 and 2035 projections.”

Fundstrat’s Mark Newton sees a bullish setup for the S&P 500 through late October.

“I anticipate a sharp rally to finish the month,” Newton said. “Breakouts in AAPL and GOOGL could lift broader indices to new all-time highs.”

Fed rate cut odds rise above 96%

Bond yields held steady ahead of economic data. The 10-year Treasury yield hovered around 3.98%, while the 2-year note traded near 3.46%.

The CME FedWatch Tool now projects a 96.7% probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its October meeting — reinforcing expectations for policy easing as growth moderates.

All eyes are on Friday’s inflation report, which could shape expectations for the Federal Reserve’s late October meeting.

According to CFRA’s Sam Stovall, markets expect another quarter-point rate cut despite weak jobs data. “The Fed won’t hesitate to cut even without clear labor support,” he wrote.

Stocks in focus: Tesla, IBM, American Airlines lead action

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) dropped 3.04% after posting better-than-expected Q3 revenue but missed earnings estimates. Despite the dip, Tesla remains strong on long-term price trends, according to Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings.

IBM (NYSE: IBM) fell 7.14% in premarket trading despite beating expectations for Q3 results. The company raised its full-year 2025 revenue growth forecast to “more than 5%” from “at least 5%.”

American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) rose 1.41% as analysts expect a quarterly loss of 28 cents per share on $13.63 billion in revenue.

Medpace Holdings (NASDAQ: MEDP) surged 18.52% after reporting $659.9 million in Q3 revenue and $3.86 EPS, both well above estimates.

Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) traded flat ahead of earnings, with consensus estimates calling for $43.08 billion in revenue and $0.36 EPS.

Southwest Airlines rose 2% after posting a surprise profit and beating revenue estimates with $6.95 billion.

Moderna fell 6% as its Phase 3 CMV vaccine trial missed its primary efficacy target.

Key data to watch Thursday

Investors are eyeing several key updates that could sway market sentiment. The initial jobless claims report has been delayed amid the looming government shutdown, while existing home sales for September will be released at 10:00 a.m. ET.

On the policy front, Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00 a.m., followed by Fed Governor Michael Barr speaking at 10:25 a.m. ET. These events are expected to provide fresh insights into the Fed’s policy direction and the broader economic outlook.

Commodities, gold, and crypto update

Commodities traded with heightened volatility in early Thursday trading. Crude oil futures jumped 5.22% to around $61.54 per barrel, rebounding on supply concerns.

Gold prices climbed 0.38% to $4,114.22 per ounce, staying below their recent record high of $4,381.6. The U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.16% to 99.0560, signaling continued demand for safe-haven assets. In digital currencies, Bitcoin (BTC) gained 1.16% to trade near $109,323.15, extending its recent bullish momentum.

Global markets mixed

Overseas markets reflected a mixed tone. Asian indices closed mostly higher, led by gains in India’s NIFTY 50, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, Australia’s ASX 200, and China’s CSI 300. However, Japan’s Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s Kospi ended lower amid caution ahead of U.S. earnings and trade developments. In Europe, major indices opened on a mixed note, with traders closely tracking geopolitical headlines and global bond movements for cues.

Wednesday recap: Markets close lower

All major U.S. indexes closed in the red on Wednesday, weighed down by industrials, communication services, and consumer discretionary stocks.

AAPL,Tesla earnings showed the company needs Elon Musk's full attention as it pivots to AI,Technology,"Good morning and welcome to First Trade. ""KPop Demon Hunters"" and record revenue weren't enough to help Netflix stock after earnings. It suffered its worst day since March after a tax issue took investors by surprise.

Rundown

Beyond Meat had another wild day. The stock more than doubled in early trading on Wednesday, only to finish lower. Options traders can't get enough.

The founder of ""China's Nvidia"" had a great week. His company reported a 17-fold revenue increase that sent its stock — and his net worth — soaring.

Gold flew too close to the sun. Here's why it fell 7% from record highs in just two days.

But first, Tesla earnings show a company in transition.

Market musings

Tesla needs Elon's attention

For Tesla investors looking for good news during earnings season, few things are more important than CEO Elon Musk keeping his eye on the ball.

It's easy to see why: Periods when Musk has been distracted with other endeavors match up closely with weak stretches of Tesla stock performance.

Remember Musk's prolonged dalliance with Twitter that ended with him acquiring the company? That took up much of 2022, a year when Tesla fell 65%, its only annual decline since 2016 (and a deep one at that).

There was also the first few months of 2025, which saw shares cut nearly in half by mid-April as Musk took up a new role in Washington, DC as the head of DOGE. The stock has rallied significantly since he stepped away in late May.

If you're a Tesla shareholder, you probably want Elon as involved with the company as possible, even if you don't like his jokes and memes.

Well, he's been more involved lately, and relatively quiet (by his frantic social-media-posting standards). So how did that end up working out for the company's latest earnings?

It was mixed. On the bright side, the company reported record revenue that beat expectations. On the other hand, earnings per share missed forecasts. Investors elected to see the glass half empty, pushing the stock down after the report. Losses then extended to around 3% during the analyst call. The stock is still roughly the same amount lower in premarket trading today.

To put the move in context: Tesla's absolute directional move on an average day in 2025 has been 3%.

Digging deeper into Tesla's report reveals a picture of a company in transition. It did beat revenue estimates, but operating income and profit are down sharply from a year ago. EV sales are slowing — and not just for Tesla — so the company has pivoted hard towards AI, playing up ambitions around self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

In a way — given the valuation Tesla still carries, relative to the growth of its core business — the company has become just as much of an AI play as its Magnificent 7 counterparts. And who better to lead (and market) that charge than Musk?

That's how Tesla's board feels, having proposed an incentive-laden $1 trillion pay package to tie Musk to the company for years to come. The shareholder vote will be on Nov. 6, and the stakes are high. In an X post last weekend, Musk effectively threatened to leave if the package wasn't approved.

If it gets the go-ahead, it could mark an important step in ensuring Musk stays near Tesla, which has historically been a winning move for the stock.

On the move

It's been far from a straight line, but, through Wednesday, Tesla's stock was up 23% since Musk officially left his post with DOGE on May 28.

The stock has also benefited from other positive forces, most prominently the start of the Federal Reserve's latest rate-cut cycle in mid-September, after a 10-month pause.

Above all else, Musk refocusing on Tesla ensured the company would avoid testing the multiyear lows it experienced in March and April, a period marked by government distractions — as well as reports of slowing EV sales globally.

BI market mix

Options traders are having a field day with Beyond Meat. There's been record volume, and data shared with BI showed investors are still wagering on large price swings.

The IMF has a big warning. It says that stock valuations are overextended, which has the market at risk of ""disorderly corrections."" Those pullbacks could also hit the economy if they impact consumer spending, the organization said.

Gold got its comeuppance. After setting record after record and dominating all other assets for much of 2025, gold prices fell 7% in just two days. Here's why it got hit so hard.

MVP of the week

The first MVP in First Trade history is Chen Tianshi, the founder and CEO of China-based AI chip startup Cambricon Technologies, which has been called ""China's Nvidia"" by retail traders.

Cambricon (and Chen) have been major beneficiaries of China's push to ice out Nvidia and make semiconductor chips domestically. The latest example of this came during the company's quarterly earnings report, which saw a 14-fold revenue spike.

The report sent Cambricon shares on a tear this week, up 15% through Wednesday. Chen's net worth rose in tandem, going from $21.7 billion last week to $24.1 billion as of Wednesday, an increase of $2.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Forbes. He currently sits as the 94th-richest person in the world.

Chen is a human face of the ongoing trade war around semi chips, and he's poised to keep growing wealthier as long as China keeps trying to manufacture in-house.

He had a remarkable week in the market, and — as shown in the chart below — has seen his company's fortunes brighten significantly in the past three months as Trump and Xi have battled over trade policies.

Pro tip

Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets.

Today's investing idea is from Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX Advisors, and it's centered around the so-called debasement trade that we unpacked here in First Trade earlier this week. The trade is characterized by investors increasingly jumping into assets that they believe will protect them against the falling value of government bonds and fiat currencies.

In this vein, McMillan says throwing some money into both gold and bitcoin for the next 10 years could be a smart play, even after this week's historic sell-off in gold. Both assets are still up more than 45% over the last 12 months.

""This is not a shift along the demand curve for gold. This is a shift in the demand curve, meaning you've got central banks for the first time ever taking gold basically off the marketplace,"" he told Business Insider.

""It's going into vaults in China, India, Russia, and everywhere else, and it's out of circulation. It's not unlike Bitcoin being burned, frankly. And that's because people are worried about the beginning of the end of dollar hegemony,"" he continued, adding: ""Bitcoin is just a digital version of that trade.""

McMillan said both assets could more than double in value from current levels over the next decade.

""$10,000-an-ounce gold isn't insane, and neither is $250,000 bitcoin,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean it'll happen next year, but the forces behind it are strong.""

The crypto market is looking to regain upside traction, with bitcoin BTC$ 111,174.69 attempting to top $110,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index has risen over 1% in the past 24 hours alongside double-digit gains in a select few tokens such as HYPE, KHYPE and XMR.

Sentiment on social media remains bullish, thanks to expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 bps next week, continuing the so-called liquidity easing cycle. Still, it's worth noting that the dollar index is continuing to exhibit bullish price action. A strengthening dollar could limit upside in BTC.

Risk proxies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) aren't supportive either. Both have recently penetrated key support levels. (Check the TA section). Meanwhile, key volume studies point to underlying weakness in the bitcoin market.

Taken together, these factors validate the persistent put bias in BTC options listed on Deribit and Standard Chartered's short-term bearish outlook.

Founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said that the recent banking funding stress and liquidity tightening are ""keeping BTC anchored and negatively impacting underlying risk dynamics."" Still, they added that the bull run is far from over, pointing to lower bond yields and economic slowdown risks as catalysts for aggressive Fed easing that could cause a ""melt up.""

In traditional markets, oil rose 4% on both sides of the Atlantic after the U.S. imposed sanctions on major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war. Increased volatility in the oil market could cause risk aversion. Stay alert!

Token Talk

By Francisco Rodrigues

Jupiter's native token, JUP, rose more than 3% in the last 24 hours after the decentralized exchange posted strong growth across key business metrics in the third quarter.

The Solana-based project is also pushing to launch its own stablecoin and prediction market.

Quarterly revenue rose 19.2% to $45.8 million, while trading volume, driven by both spot and perpetual products, jumped 71% to $242.8 billion.

Fees generated reached $121.5 million, up nearly 48% from the second quarter. Despite the growth, JUP's market cap edged down 1.5% to $1.35 billion.

Jupiter attributed the growth to new product rollouts, including its Ultra v3 trading engine and a lending protocol that the team says is one of the fastest-growing on Solana. Active wallets increased 5% to 8.4 million, and total value locked (TVL) rose 41.7% to $3.4 billion.

JUP outperformed the wider crypto market, which rose 1.6% based on the performance of the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.

Derivatives Positioning

Open interest (OI) in HYPE futures surged 17% in 24 hours, reaching a two-week high of 40.24 million HYPE. Occurring alongside a rise in price and positive funding rates, the increase indicates growing demand for leveraged bullish exposure.

OI in BTC and ETH has barely changed, a sign traders are reluctant to place bets ahead of Friday's U.S. CPI release.

Volmex's BVIV, which measures the annualized 30-day implied volatility in BTC, has pulled back slightly to 50% but remains well above the September low of 35%. The elevated level reflects persistent concerns arising from newfound risks like auto-deleveraging and liquidity issues.

Funding rates for major cryptocurrencies continue to hover near zero in a sign of balanced market conditions. XMR and BNB rates are slightly negative, indicating a bias for bearish short positions.

On Deribit, flows featured BTC put spreads. Overall, puts continue to trade at a premium to calls.

AAPL,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Technology,"By Neil J Kanatt and Prerna Bedi

(Reuters) -Hasbro raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts on Thursday banking on strong demand for its digital games, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", at a time when tariff uncertainty looms over the all-important holiday season.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, risks a significant hit from the tariffs, with a recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese imports further clouding the outlook.

Hasbro said it plans to bring down its reliance on imports from China to 30% of its revenue by 2026, compared to its previous expectation of cutting it to 40% by 2027.

The company had also rolled out job cuts and a $1 billion cost-savings program earlier this year to cushion any likely hit.

""We're executing our tariff remediation playbook decisively, mitigating risk and protecting profitability,"" finance chief Gina Goetter said in a post-earnings call.

Peer Mattel maintained its annual outlook after missing third-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, as retailers delayed orders due to an uncertain economic outlook.

""Even with retailers taking a cautious approach to restocking, Hasbro's core brands — from Magic: The Gathering to Monopoly Go — are doing the heavy lifting,"" eMarketer analyst Zak Stambor said.

The company also said it expects momentum for its brands to remain strong in the current quarter, which falls in the crucial holiday sales period.

Hasbro expects annual revenue to increase by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of a mid-single-digit rise.

Shares of the toymaker, which have climbed more than 34% so far this year, were flat in early trading.

It also expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with its previous $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion forecast.

Revenue for the third quarter rose 8% to $1.39 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenue jumped 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year earlier.

Adjusted profit per share of $1.68 also topped estimates of $1.63.

TORONTO, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Rogers Communications Inc. (TSX: RCI.A and RCI.B; NYSE: RCI) today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Article content

“In the third quarter, we delivered industry-leading combined Wireless and Internet subscriber growth, underpinned by our lowest churn in over two years and healthy margins in Wireless and Cable,” said Tony Staffieri, President and CEO. “Our media and sports business also drove strong double-digit revenue growth, highlighting our world-class assets and the opportunity to unlock value for shareholders.”

Article content

Consolidated Financial Highlights

Article content

Revenue

The 26% increase in revenue this quarter and 21% increase year to date were a result of:

Article content

revenue from MLSE following the MLSE Transaction;

higher sports-related revenue due to higher Toronto Blue Jays revenue; and

higher advertising and subscriber revenue related to the launch of the Warner Bros. Discovery suite of channels.

Article content

Operating costs

The 47% increase in operating costs this quarter and 22% increase year to date were a result of:

Article content

costs incurred by MLSE following the MLSE Transaction;

higher programming costs, including those related to the launch of the Warner Bros. Discovery suite of channels, and higher production costs; and

higher Toronto Blue Jays expenses, including player payroll and game day-related costs.

Article content

Adjusted EBITDA

The decreases in adjusted EBITDA this quarter and year to date were a result of the revenue and expense changes discussed above.

Article content

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Article content

Article content

1 Includes additions to property, plant and equipment net of proceeds on disposition, but does not include expenditures for spectrum licences, additions to right-of-use assets, or assets acquired through business combinations.

2 Capital intensity is a supplementary financial measure. See “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more information about this measure, available at www.sedarplus.ca.

Article content

Cable

The decreases in capital expenditures in Cable this quarter and year to date were a result of prioritizing our capital investments and striving to recognize capital efficiencies. Capital expenditures reflect continued investments in our infrastructure, including additional fibre deployments to increase our FTTH distribution. These investments incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an enhanced customer experience as we progress in our connected home roadmap, including service footprint expansion and upgrades to our DOCSIS 3.1 platform to evolve to DOCSIS 4.0, offering increased network resilience, stability, and faster download speeds over time.

Article content

Media

The increase in capital expenditures in Media this quarter was primarily a result of ongoing investments made to revitalize Scotiabank Arena. The decrease year to date was a result of lower Toronto Blue Jays stadium infrastructure-related expenditures associated with the Rogers Centre modernization project, and lower broadcast and digital infrastructures expenditures.

Article content

Capital intensity

Capital intensity decreased this quarter and year to date as a result of the revenue and capital expenditure changes discussed above.

Article content

1 Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on the fair value increment recognized on acquisition of Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. For purposes of calculating adjusted net income, we believe the magnitude of this depreciation and amortization, which was significantly affected by the size of the Shaw Transaction, may have no correlation to our current and ongoing operating results and affects comparability between certain periods. Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of $210 million and $651 million (2024 – $227 million and $689 million). Adjusted net income includes depreciation and amortization on the acquired Shaw property, plant and equipment and intangible assets based on Shaw’s historical cost and depreciation policies.

2 Finance costs exclude the $151 million gain on repayment of long-term debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Finance costs also exclude the $134 million and $41 million change in fair value of subsidiary equity derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Effective the second quarter of 2025 and as a result of closing the network transaction, we believe removing this amount more accurately reflects our ongoing operational results as these derivative instruments economically hedge the foreign exchange impacts of the network transaction but they are not eligible to be accounted for as hedges in accordance with IFRS. See “Financial Risk Management – Subsidiary equity derivatives” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more details on these derivative instruments.

3 Other income excludes a $5,016 million gain on revaluation of our existing investment in MLSE as a result of the MLSE Transaction.

4 Income tax expense excludes recoveries of $42 million and $194 million (2024 – recoveries of $82 million and $263 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 related to the income tax impact for adjusted items.

Article content

Effective the second quarter of 2025, as a result of the closing of the network transaction, we introduced a new non-GAAP measure – adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders. In addition to the adjustments applied to net income to calculate adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders further adjusts net income attributable to RCI shareholders by removing the impacts of foreign exchange revaluation within BNSI as the subsidiary equity derivatives we have entered into economically and effectively hedge our foreign exchange exposures arising from the investment.

Key Performance Indicators

Article content

We measure the success of our strategy using a number of key performance indicators that are defined and discussed in our 2024 Annual MD&A and this earnings release. We believe these key performance indicators allow us to appropriately measure our performance against our operating strategy and against the results of our peers and competitors. The following key performance indicators, some of which are supplementary financial measures (see “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures”), are not measurements in accordance with IFRS. They include:

AAPL,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Technology,"Hasbro has today raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts, betting on Christmas season sales and demand for its digital gaming segment, even as macroeconomic uncertainties cast a gloom on spending among American shoppers.

Shares of the company, which also beat quarterly revenue estimates, were up about 3% in premarket trading.

The toymaker's digital titles, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", helped offset softness in its traditional toy business, which faces pressure from weak consumer demand amid persistent inflation and the Trump administration's volatile trade policy.

The company forecast fiscal-year 2025 revenue to grow by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of mid-single-digit rise and adjusted EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation - to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with the $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion range forecast earlier.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, has taken a significant hit from US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, with the recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese goods threatening to further pressurize the industry.

""We managed tariff volatility with agility, protected margins through cost productivity and pricing discipline, and continued to advance our transformation initiatives,"" Gina Goetter, chief financial officer, said in a statement.

The company's quarterly revenue of $1.39 billion beat analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Revenue in its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment rose 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year ago.

AAPL,This CEO says young investors trying to protect their cash is stopping them from getting rich — here's why,Technology,"Many young investors are keeping their cash out of the stock market, and one financial expert says that could be the “biggest mistake” they make.

Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, argues that focusing too much on protecting themselves from losses can be counterintuitive to building wealth for the long term.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’

“When you’re young, worrying more about downside than upside is probably the biggest mistake,” he told CNBC in an interview published Oct. 10. (1) “You have to get rich before you focus on preserving your wealth.”

But in an economy clouded by inflation, tariffs and political uncertainty, even seasoned investors are asking: Where do I invest now?

Young investors fear the stock market

According to a Bankrate poll, among Americans who did not prefer the stock market as an investment tool, roughly 29% of Gen Z (ages 18-28) and 24% of millennials (ages 29-44) said the stock market felt too intimidating — higher shares than any other generation. (2)

Some may be retreating into cash investments (e.g., CDs, savings accounts) or bonds, thinking they’re playing it safe, however, stocks have outperformed both over time. From 1957 to 2024, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return, including dividends, of 11.84%, compared to just 5.71% for 10-year Treasury Bonds, according to data compiled by New York University.

The largest advantage young people have in terms of investing is time. Even in the face of market volatility, young investors often have decades to let their earnings compound and recoup from any short-term losses.

“When you appreciate how much time you have, you recognize the benefit of long-term compounding,” Brown said.

Even so, some investors can’t shake the feeling that 2025 may be riskier than usual. Are there ways consumers can invest in the market while limiting risk?

A more innovative way to take risks

Investing in the stock market inherently comes with risk, but there are different strategies for dealing with it.

One touted by experts is diversification. For young investors, this often means skipping individual stock picking in favour of low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the broader market. Doing so gives you exposure to a variety of sectors instead of a single company or industry. Essentially, you’re not putting all of your eggs in one basket.

Some ETFs also look beyond the U.S. stock market and invest in companies across the globe, adding further diversity.

Investors may also want to consider recession-resistant sectors — such as health care, consumer staples and utilities — which tend to hold up better when markets falter.

Being mindful of the type of account used to invest is also key, especially for new investors. For example, investing and contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income for that year, unlike investing with an ordinary brokerage account.

Blackstone Profits Soar But Lower Rates Bring Scrutiny to Credit Back to video

Article content

Blackstone’s distributable earnings surged 48% in the third quarter, fueled by a burst of investment exits from its private equity arm, according to an earnings release on Thursday.

Article content

Article content

“The cost of financing and more availability of capital is allowing the system of capital to move much faster,” President Jon Gray said in an interview.

Article content

The $1.2 trillion firm is a giant nonbank lender in its own right, with credit dominating flows in the third quarter.

Article content

Blackstone’s significant presence in private credit exposes it to scrutiny and shifting investor sentiment in that market. Future rate cuts stand to reduce the firm’s ability to charge borrowers more on floating-rate loans.

Article content

“As base rates come down and as spreads tighten, some of the very high returns that were achieved being a senior lender in private credit, that’s harder to do,” Gray said in a separate interview on Bloomberg TV.

Article content

“By definition, when rates come down, that impacts yield,” Gray said on the call. But private-credit investors will ultimately understand that they can still get a “meaningful premium” to public markets, he added.

AI Boom

Article content

Across the firm, profit available to shareholders jumped to $1.89 billion, or $1.52 a share, beating the $1.22 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Blackstone more than doubled its haul from selling investments in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. It also took three companies public.

Article content

Blackstone’s highest-performing strategy during the third quarter was infrastructure, which delivered a 5.2% return. The firm has bet big on data centers, energy and the grid — areas that could be the “picks and shovels” that drive AI.

Article content

Unlike the dot-com boom of the 2000s, “the companies who are leading this era right now, for the most part, are highly profitable, large-cap companies with pristine balance sheets,” Gray said.

Article content

At the same time, the arrival of transformative technology “invariably causes some enthusiasm,” he said, warning that “there may be some pockets of that starting.”

Article content

Gray joined other private-credit executives in pushing back on recent comments by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who suggested that recent bank losses from subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings portend wider problems.

Article content

Tying a few troubled financings led by banks to providers of private credit seems like a stretch, Gray said.

“We don’t really understand that connection,” he said. “They all feel pretty idiosyncratic.”

AAPL,Kraken Reports Q3 Revenue Surge To Nearly $650 Million Ahead Of Anticipated US IPO,Technology,"Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Ahead of one of the most anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) in the digital asset sector, US-based crypto exchange Kraken has reported record revenue for the third quarter (Q3) of the year.

New Kraken Exchange Milestones

In a statement released on Wednesday, Kraken revealed that its Q3 2025 revenues (net of trading costs) reached $648.0 million, marking a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter and setting a new all-time high for the company.

Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) soared to $178.6 million, a 124% increase compared to the previous quarter, with margins rising by nine points to 27.6%.

Total platform transaction volume climbed to $561.9 billion, up 23% from the previous quarter of the year, while assets on the platform grew by 34% to $59.3 billion. Kraken’s community continues to expand, with 5.2 million funded accounts reported at the end of the quarter.

These results come as Kraken prepares for its initial public offering potentially for next year. The company disclosed last month that it is in advanced discussions with a strategic investor to secure new funding at a revised valuation of approximately $20 billion.

A number of crypto firms, including, Gemini Space Station (GEMI), and Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR), are pursuing US market debuts this year, buoyed by a more favorable regulatory environment under the pro-crypto Trump administration.

Such regulatory developments led to the Nasdaq debuts of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) and Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) this year. Initial excitement surrounding their launches led to a considerable surge in their respective stocks.

Acquisition Strategy Pays Off

Kraken’s success is also supported by several acquisitions announced this year. Following the acquisition of NinjaTrader, Kraken has been expanding its derivatives offerings, with futures daily average revenue trades (DARTs) reaching 741,000 in Q3, a 42% increase from the previous quarter.

Last week, Kraken also acquired Small Exchange, a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market (DCM), which enhances its direct market-access infrastructure in the US,

Looking ahead, Kraken emphasized that its Q3 2025 results not only reflect strong financial performance but also the company’s commitment to shaping systems that will define the future of finance. “We are building what legacy financial systems were not designed to achieve,” the statement noted.

Our goal is to connect our infrastructure into a single digital network where capital moves seamlessly across asset classes, time zones, and use cases. This system will enable clients to invest and trade anything, anywhere—instantly and securely, without friction or fragmentation. This is more than an evolution; it’s the foundation of a new global operating system built for openness, speed, and scale.

AAPL,Gainers & Losers: Infosys among 6 stocks that hogged limelight on Thursday,Technology,"Newsmakers of D-Street

India’s benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex conceded most of their morning gains to close the session with a mild uptick. The selling pressure in heavyweights Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank did major damage. Auto stocks were also under the heat. While the broader Nifty index closed at 25,891, up 22 points or 0.09%, Sensex finished at 84,556, gaining 130 points or 0.15%. Here are 6 stocks that saw action today:

Infosys

Infosys: IT stocks surged up to 3.6% on Thursday led by Infosys amid renewed optimism around a US-India trade deal and easing tensions between the US and China. HCL Technologies, Mphasis and TCS also gained over 2%, pulling the Nifty IT index 2.2% higher.

Jain Resource Recycling

Shares of Ashish Kacholia-backed Jain Resource Recycling surged 9% to their new 52-week high of Rs 387 on the NSE, after the company reported a strong set of numbers for the second quarter of financial year FY26. The Q2 PAT jumped 88% to Rs 99 crore. The stock gave up its early gains to close 3.3% higher at Rs 366.90 as market sentiments faded after a strong opening.

Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever: Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) surged 3% to hit the day’s high of Rs 2,667 on Thursday after the company’s second-quarter earnings beat Street estimates. The company reported a consolidated PAT of Rs 2,685 crore for Q2 FY26, which was up 3.6% YoY. The stock conceded its gains towards the closing time amid profit booking and ended at Rs 2,601, up 0.4%.

Sikko Industries

Shares of small-cap company Sikko Industries surged 20% to hit their 52-week high of Rs 124 on the NSE, after the company announced a stock split in the ratio of 1:10 and a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1.

Dixon Technologies

Shares of Dixon Technologies India slipped 4% to their day’s low of Rs 15,540 today, continuing its weak trajectory following second-quarter earnings. The stock witnessed its fifth consecutive decline to finish at Rs 15,650, nearly 3% lower from the previous closing.

RIL

Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 2.3% from their day's high to hit Thursday's low of Rs 1,448.10 on the NSE after a media report suggested that the telecom-to-energy behemoth will stop importing oil from Russian oil major Rosneft.

AAPL,American Airlines' fourth quarter forecast tops estimates,Technology,"American Airlines posted a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and its outlook for the rest of the year came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, sending the stock higher.

American expects to earn between 45 cents and 75 cents per share in the fourth quarter, above the 31 per share cents analysts expected. That brought American's full-year earnings guidance to between 65 cents and 95 cents per share, well above the projected 43 cents per share Wall Street forecast. The carrier expects its fourth-quarter capacity to grow between 3% and 5% over the same period last year.

Once a slam dunk quarter, airlines have found it harder to make money in the summer than in years past. Schools reopen earlier than they used to and some travelers opt to take bigger trips later in the year, when the weather is cooler and there are fewer crowds at many popular destinations.

American posted a net loss of $114 million, or 17 cents a share on revenue of $13.69 billion. Revenue was up 0.3% from last year. Excluding net special items of $3 million following the effect of taxes, the company had an adjusted loss per share of 17 cents.

American's third-quarter outlook in July had disappointed investors, though other carriers had also cut their profit outlooks for the year after demand dropped in early 2025 as customers weighed a slew of on-again, off-again tariffs and economic uncertainty.

AAPL,Beiersdorf Downgrades FY Guidance as Skin Care Market Decelerates,Technology,"PARIS — Beiersdorf AG stock held steady Thursday hours after the German beauty giant downgraded its consumer business’ sales growth, due to the ongoing slowdown of the skin care market.

“We saw a further deceleration of the skin care market in the third quarter of 2025, especially in emerging markets, which is why we now expect an organic sales growth for our consumer business of around 2.5 percent for the full year,” Beiersdorf chief executive officer Vincent Warnery said in a statement.

Our strategy for Nivea remains on track.”

Jefferies analyst David Hayes spotlighted a step-up in Nivea growth in September — at plus 8 percent on innovation rollout — but wrote in a note that it “only highlights the core brand is struggling [July/August around minus 4.5 percent].

JPM,Stocks rise on upbeat earnings; Russia sanctions boost oil,Financial Services,"In this article:

By Amanda Cooper

LONDON (Reuters) -Global stocks got a boost on Thursday from a slew of upbeat earnings that helped counter some of the gloom on Wall Street over a lacklustre showing from tech megacaps, while oil prices surged following U.S. sanctions against Russia.

Oil jumped 5% after Washington imposed sanctions on major Russian companies Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war.

European equities shook off overnight weakness in Asia and the U.S. as a clutch of positive earnings boosted domestic indexes, leaving the STOXX 600 up 0.3% on the day.

However, MSCI's All-World index dipped 0.1%, heading for its third consecutive daily decline.

Chinese stocks closed up 0.3%, having recovered from a 1.1% drop after sources said the White House was considering a plan to curb an array of software-powered exports to China in retaliation against Beijing's latest round of rare earth export restrictions.

""With no fresh macro data to anchor sentiment, investors are leaning defensive while Trump's Asia visit (next week) stirs geopolitical nerves,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Bank in Singapore.

POSITIVE EARNINGS SURPRISES

Global equity markets are easing off record highs as corporate earnings season kicks off. While there has been some disappointment over results or outlooks from megacaps, most companies so far have beaten analysts' estimates.

Futures on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged down 0.1%, surrendering earlier gains.

Tesla, the first of the so-called Magnificent 7 to report earnings, saw shares fall around 3% in premarket trading on Thursday after missing profit estimates despite record third-quarter revenue.

But there was still plenty for tech bulls to get their teeth into. A report from the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. government is in talks with several quantum-computing companies to take stakes in exchange for federal funding saw shares in IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum jump more than 20%.

Oil rose by as much as 5.5% to a two-week high of $66.04 a barrel, after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose Ukraine-related sanctions. EU countries also approved a 19th package of sanctions on Moscow that included a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports, while Britain hit Rosneft and Lukoil with sanctions last week.

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE LURE OF RATE CUTS

Helping to offset some of the angst over geopolitical flashpoints and trade tensions is the firm belief among investors that the Federal Reserve is on the verge of a rate-cutting spree. Markets show traders are banking on U.S. rates falling to 3% by June from 4% currently.

""Never underestimate the lure of a Fed that's cutting rates and also the magic words: ending QT,"" IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp said, referring to the central bank's quantitative tightening programme, under which it runs down its holdings of government bonds to help tighten credit conditions.

The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six others, was last up 0.1%. Since hitting a 3-1/2-year low in August, it has steadily edged higher, as investors have become more confident the Fed will act to protect the economy.

Gold, which is heading for its biggest weekly slide since May, was up 0.5% on the day at $4,114 an ounce. The price briefly veered towards the $4,000 mark overnight, as investors booked profits ahead of U.S. inflation data due this week.

Market musings

Tesla needs Elon's attention

For Tesla investors looking for good news during earnings season, few things are more important than CEO Elon Musk keeping his eye on the ball.

It's easy to see why: Periods when Musk has been distracted with other endeavors match up closely with weak stretches of Tesla stock performance.

Remember Musk's prolonged dalliance with Twitter that ended with him acquiring the company? That took up much of 2022, a year when Tesla fell 65%, its only annual decline since 2016 (and a deep one at that).

There was also the first few months of 2025, which saw shares cut nearly in half by mid-April as Musk took up a new role in Washington, DC as the head of DOGE. The stock has rallied significantly since he stepped away in late May.

If you're a Tesla shareholder, you probably want Elon as involved with the company as possible, even if you don't like his jokes and memes.

Well, he's been more involved lately, and relatively quiet (by his frantic social-media-posting standards). So how did that end up working out for the company's latest earnings?

It was mixed. On the bright side, the company reported record revenue that beat expectations. On the other hand, earnings per share missed forecasts. Investors elected to see the glass half empty, pushing the stock down after the report. Losses then extended to around 3% during the analyst call. The stock is still roughly the same amount lower in premarket trading today.

To put the move in context: Tesla's absolute directional move on an average day in 2025 has been 3%.

Digging deeper into Tesla's report reveals a picture of a company in transition. It did beat revenue estimates, but operating income and profit are down sharply from a year ago. EV sales are slowing — and not just for Tesla — so the company has pivoted hard towards AI, playing up ambitions around self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

In a way — given the valuation Tesla still carries, relative to the growth of its core business — the company has become just as much of an AI play as its Magnificent 7 counterparts. And who better to lead (and market) that charge than Musk?

That's how Tesla's board feels, having proposed an incentive-laden $1 trillion pay package to tie Musk to the company for years to come. The shareholder vote will be on Nov. 6, and the stakes are high. In an X post last weekend, Musk effectively threatened to leave if the package wasn't approved.

If it gets the go-ahead, it could mark an important step in ensuring Musk stays near Tesla, which has historically been a winning move for the stock.

On the move

It's been far from a straight line, but, through Wednesday, Tesla's stock was up 23% since Musk officially left his post with DOGE on May 28.

The stock has also benefited from other positive forces, most prominently the start of the Federal Reserve's latest rate-cut cycle in mid-September, after a 10-month pause.

Above all else, Musk refocusing on Tesla ensured the company would avoid testing the multiyear lows it experienced in March and April, a period marked by government distractions — as well as reports of slowing EV sales globally.

BI market mix

Options traders are having a field day with Beyond Meat. There's been record volume, and data shared with BI showed investors are still wagering on large price swings.

The IMF has a big warning. It says that stock valuations are overextended, which has the market at risk of ""disorderly corrections."" Those pullbacks could also hit the economy if they impact consumer spending, the organization said.

Gold got its comeuppance. After setting record after record and dominating all other assets for much of 2025, gold prices fell 7% in just two days. Here's why it got hit so hard.

MVP of the week

The first MVP in First Trade history is Chen Tianshi, the founder and CEO of China-based AI chip startup Cambricon Technologies, which has been called ""China's Nvidia"" by retail traders.

Cambricon (and Chen) have been major beneficiaries of China's push to ice out Nvidia and make semiconductor chips domestically. The latest example of this came during the company's quarterly earnings report, which saw a 14-fold revenue spike.

The report sent Cambricon shares on a tear this week, up 15% through Wednesday. Chen's net worth rose in tandem, going from $21.7 billion last week to $24.1 billion as of Wednesday, an increase of $2.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Forbes. He currently sits as the 94th-richest person in the world.

Chen is a human face of the ongoing trade war around semi chips, and he's poised to keep growing wealthier as long as China keeps trying to manufacture in-house.

He had a remarkable week in the market, and — as shown in the chart below — has seen his company's fortunes brighten significantly in the past three months as Trump and Xi have battled over trade policies.

Pro tip

Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets.

Today's investing idea is from Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX Advisors, and it's centered around the so-called debasement trade that we unpacked here in First Trade earlier this week. The trade is characterized by investors increasingly jumping into assets that they believe will protect them against the falling value of government bonds and fiat currencies.

In this vein, McMillan says throwing some money into both gold and bitcoin for the next 10 years could be a smart play, even after this week's historic sell-off in gold. Both assets are still up more than 45% over the last 12 months.

""This is not a shift along the demand curve for gold. This is a shift in the demand curve, meaning you've got central banks for the first time ever taking gold basically off the marketplace,"" he told Business Insider.

""It's going into vaults in China, India, Russia, and everywhere else, and it's out of circulation. It's not unlike Bitcoin being burned, frankly. And that's because people are worried about the beginning of the end of dollar hegemony,"" he continued, adding: ""Bitcoin is just a digital version of that trade.""

McMillan said both assets could more than double in value from current levels over the next decade.

""$10,000-an-ounce gold isn't insane, and neither is $250,000 bitcoin,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean it'll happen next year, but the forces behind it are strong.""

Sentiment on social media remains bullish, thanks to expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 bps next week, continuing the so-called liquidity easing cycle. Still, it's worth noting that the dollar index is continuing to exhibit bullish price action. A strengthening dollar could limit upside in BTC.

Risk proxies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) aren't supportive either. Both have recently penetrated key support levels. (Check the TA section). Meanwhile, key volume studies point to underlying weakness in the bitcoin market.

Taken together, these factors validate the persistent put bias in BTC options listed on Deribit and Standard Chartered's short-term bearish outlook.

Founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said that the recent banking funding stress and liquidity tightening are ""keeping BTC anchored and negatively impacting underlying risk dynamics."" Still, they added that the bull run is far from over, pointing to lower bond yields and economic slowdown risks as catalysts for aggressive Fed easing that could cause a ""melt up.""

In traditional markets, oil rose 4% on both sides of the Atlantic after the U.S. imposed sanctions on major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war. Increased volatility in the oil market could cause risk aversion. Stay alert!

Token Talk

By Francisco Rodrigues

Jupiter's native token, JUP, rose more than 3% in the last 24 hours after the decentralized exchange posted strong growth across key business metrics in the third quarter.

The Solana-based project is also pushing to launch its own stablecoin and prediction market.

Quarterly revenue rose 19.2% to $45.8 million, while trading volume, driven by both spot and perpetual products, jumped 71% to $242.8 billion.

Fees generated reached $121.5 million, up nearly 48% from the second quarter. Despite the growth, JUP's market cap edged down 1.5% to $1.35 billion.

Jupiter attributed the growth to new product rollouts, including its Ultra v3 trading engine and a lending protocol that the team says is one of the fastest-growing on Solana. Active wallets increased 5% to 8.4 million, and total value locked (TVL) rose 41.7% to $3.4 billion.

JUP outperformed the wider crypto market, which rose 1.6% based on the performance of the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.

Derivatives Positioning

Open interest (OI) in HYPE futures surged 17% in 24 hours, reaching a two-week high of 40.24 million HYPE. Occurring alongside a rise in price and positive funding rates, the increase indicates growing demand for leveraged bullish exposure.

OI in BTC and ETH has barely changed, a sign traders are reluctant to place bets ahead of Friday's U.S. CPI release.

Volmex's BVIV, which measures the annualized 30-day implied volatility in BTC, has pulled back slightly to 50% but remains well above the September low of 35%. The elevated level reflects persistent concerns arising from newfound risks like auto-deleveraging and liquidity issues.

Funding rates for major cryptocurrencies continue to hover near zero in a sign of balanced market conditions. XMR and BNB rates are slightly negative, indicating a bias for bearish short positions.

On Deribit, flows featured BTC put spreads. Overall, puts continue to trade at a premium to calls.

JPM,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Financial Services,"By Neil J Kanatt and Prerna Bedi

(Reuters) -Hasbro raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts on Thursday banking on strong demand for its digital games, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", at a time when tariff uncertainty looms over the all-important holiday season.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, risks a significant hit from the tariffs, with a recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese imports further clouding the outlook.

Hasbro said it plans to bring down its reliance on imports from China to 30% of its revenue by 2026, compared to its previous expectation of cutting it to 40% by 2027.

The company had also rolled out job cuts and a $1 billion cost-savings program earlier this year to cushion any likely hit.

""We're executing our tariff remediation playbook decisively, mitigating risk and protecting profitability,"" finance chief Gina Goetter said in a post-earnings call.

Peer Mattel maintained its annual outlook after missing third-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, as retailers delayed orders due to an uncertain economic outlook.

""Even with retailers taking a cautious approach to restocking, Hasbro's core brands — from Magic: The Gathering to Monopoly Go — are doing the heavy lifting,"" eMarketer analyst Zak Stambor said.

The company also said it expects momentum for its brands to remain strong in the current quarter, which falls in the crucial holiday sales period.

Hasbro expects annual revenue to increase by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of a mid-single-digit rise.

Shares of the toymaker, which have climbed more than 34% so far this year, were flat in early trading.

It also expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with its previous $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion forecast.

Revenue for the third quarter rose 8% to $1.39 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenue jumped 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year earlier.

Adjusted profit per share of $1.68 also topped estimates of $1.63.

TORONTO, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Rogers Communications Inc. (TSX: RCI.A and RCI.B; NYSE: RCI) today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Article content

“In the third quarter, we delivered industry-leading combined Wireless and Internet subscriber growth, underpinned by our lowest churn in over two years and healthy margins in Wireless and Cable,” said Tony Staffieri, President and CEO. “Our media and sports business also drove strong double-digit revenue growth, highlighting our world-class assets and the opportunity to unlock value for shareholders.”

Consolidated Financial Highlights

Article content

Revenue

The 26% increase in revenue this quarter and 21% increase year to date were a result of:

Article content

revenue from MLSE following the MLSE Transaction;

higher sports-related revenue due to higher Toronto Blue Jays revenue; and

higher advertising and subscriber revenue related to the launch of the Warner Bros. Discovery suite of channels.

Article content

Operating costs

The 47% increase in operating costs this quarter and 22% increase year to date were a result of:

Article content

costs incurred by MLSE following the MLSE Transaction;

higher programming costs, including those related to the launch of the Warner Bros. Discovery suite of channels, and higher production costs; and

higher Toronto Blue Jays expenses, including player payroll and game day-related costs.

Article content

Adjusted EBITDA

The decreases in adjusted EBITDA this quarter and year to date were a result of the revenue and expense changes discussed above.

Article content

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Article content

Article content

1 Includes additions to property, plant and equipment net of proceeds on disposition, but does not include expenditures for spectrum licences, additions to right-of-use assets, or assets acquired through business combinations.

2 Capital intensity is a supplementary financial measure. See “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more information about this measure, available at www.sedarplus.ca.

Article content

Cable

The decreases in capital expenditures in Cable this quarter and year to date were a result of prioritizing our capital investments and striving to recognize capital efficiencies. Capital expenditures reflect continued investments in our infrastructure, including additional fibre deployments to increase our FTTH distribution. These investments incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an enhanced customer experience as we progress in our connected home roadmap, including service footprint expansion and upgrades to our DOCSIS 3.1 platform to evolve to DOCSIS 4.0, offering increased network resilience, stability, and faster download speeds over time.

Article content

Media

The increase in capital expenditures in Media this quarter was primarily a result of ongoing investments made to revitalize Scotiabank Arena. The decrease year to date was a result of lower Toronto Blue Jays stadium infrastructure-related expenditures associated with the Rogers Centre modernization project, and lower broadcast and digital infrastructures expenditures.

Article content

Capital intensity

Capital intensity decreased this quarter and year to date as a result of the revenue and capital expenditure changes discussed above.

Article content

1 Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on the fair value increment recognized on acquisition of Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. For purposes of calculating adjusted net income, we believe the magnitude of this depreciation and amortization, which was significantly affected by the size of the Shaw Transaction, may have no correlation to our current and ongoing operating results and affects comparability between certain periods. Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of $210 million and $651 million (2024 – $227 million and $689 million). Adjusted net income includes depreciation and amortization on the acquired Shaw property, plant and equipment and intangible assets based on Shaw’s historical cost and depreciation policies.

2 Finance costs exclude the $151 million gain on repayment of long-term debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Finance costs also exclude the $134 million and $41 million change in fair value of subsidiary equity derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Effective the second quarter of 2025 and as a result of closing the network transaction, we believe removing this amount more accurately reflects our ongoing operational results as these derivative instruments economically hedge the foreign exchange impacts of the network transaction but they are not eligible to be accounted for as hedges in accordance with IFRS. See “Financial Risk Management – Subsidiary equity derivatives” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more details on these derivative instruments.

3 Other income excludes a $5,016 million gain on revaluation of our existing investment in MLSE as a result of the MLSE Transaction.

4 Income tax expense excludes recoveries of $42 million and $194 million (2024 – recoveries of $82 million and $263 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 related to the income tax impact for adjusted items.

Article content

Effective the second quarter of 2025, as a result of the closing of the network transaction, we introduced a new non-GAAP measure – adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders. In addition to the adjustments applied to net income to calculate adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders further adjusts net income attributable to RCI shareholders by removing the impacts of foreign exchange revaluation within BNSI as the subsidiary equity derivatives we have entered into economically and effectively hedge our foreign exchange exposures arising from the investment.

Key Performance Indicators

Article content

We measure the success of our strategy using a number of key performance indicators that are defined and discussed in our 2024 Annual MD&A and this earnings release. We believe these key performance indicators allow us to appropriately measure our performance against our operating strategy and against the results of our peers and competitors. The following key performance indicators, some of which are supplementary financial measures (see “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures”), are not measurements in accordance with IFRS. They include:

Article content

subscriber counts;

Wireless;

Cable; and

homes passed (Cable);

Wireless subscriber churn (churn);

JPM,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Financial Services,"Hasbro has today raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts, betting on Christmas season sales and demand for its digital gaming segment, even as macroeconomic uncertainties cast a gloom on spending among American shoppers.

Shares of the company, which also beat quarterly revenue estimates, were up about 3% in premarket trading.

The toymaker's digital titles, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", helped offset softness in its traditional toy business, which faces pressure from weak consumer demand amid persistent inflation and the Trump administration's volatile trade policy.

The company forecast fiscal-year 2025 revenue to grow by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of mid-single-digit rise and adjusted EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation - to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with the $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion range forecast earlier.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, has taken a significant hit from US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, with the recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese goods threatening to further pressurize the industry.

""We managed tariff volatility with agility, protected margins through cost productivity and pricing discipline, and continued to advance our transformation initiatives,"" Gina Goetter, chief financial officer, said in a statement.

The company's quarterly revenue of $1.39 billion beat analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Revenue in its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment rose 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year ago.

JPM,This CEO says young investors trying to protect their cash is stopping them from getting rich — here's why,Financial Services,"Many young investors are keeping their cash out of the stock market, and one financial expert says that could be the “biggest mistake” they make.

Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, argues that focusing too much on protecting themselves from losses can be counterintuitive to building wealth for the long term.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’

“When you’re young, worrying more about downside than upside is probably the biggest mistake,” he told CNBC in an interview published Oct. 10. (1) “You have to get rich before you focus on preserving your wealth.”

But in an economy clouded by inflation, tariffs and political uncertainty, even seasoned investors are asking: Where do I invest now?

Young investors fear the stock market

According to a Bankrate poll, among Americans who did not prefer the stock market as an investment tool, roughly 29% of Gen Z (ages 18-28) and 24% of millennials (ages 29-44) said the stock market felt too intimidating — higher shares than any other generation. (2)

Some may be retreating into cash investments (e.g., CDs, savings accounts) or bonds, thinking they’re playing it safe, however, stocks have outperformed both over time. From 1957 to 2024, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return, including dividends, of 11.84%, compared to just 5.71% for 10-year Treasury Bonds, according to data compiled by New York University.

The largest advantage young people have in terms of investing is time. Even in the face of market volatility, young investors often have decades to let their earnings compound and recoup from any short-term losses.

“When you appreciate how much time you have, you recognize the benefit of long-term compounding,” Brown said.

Even so, some investors can’t shake the feeling that 2025 may be riskier than usual. Are there ways consumers can invest in the market while limiting risk?

A more innovative way to take risks

Investing in the stock market inherently comes with risk, but there are different strategies for dealing with it.

One touted by experts is diversification. For young investors, this often means skipping individual stock picking in favour of low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the broader market. Doing so gives you exposure to a variety of sectors instead of a single company or industry. Essentially, you’re not putting all of your eggs in one basket.

Some ETFs also look beyond the U.S. stock market and invest in companies across the globe, adding further diversity.

Investors may also want to consider recession-resistant sectors — such as health care, consumer staples and utilities — which tend to hold up better when markets falter.

Being mindful of the type of account used to invest is also key, especially for new investors. For example, investing and contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income for that year, unlike investing with an ordinary brokerage account.

Blackstone Profits Soar But Lower Rates Bring Scrutiny to Credit Back to video

Article content

Blackstone’s distributable earnings surged 48% in the third quarter, fueled by a burst of investment exits from its private equity arm, according to an earnings release on Thursday.

Article content

Article content

“The cost of financing and more availability of capital is allowing the system of capital to move much faster,” President Jon Gray said in an interview.

Article content

The $1.2 trillion firm is a giant nonbank lender in its own right, with credit dominating flows in the third quarter.

Article content

Blackstone’s significant presence in private credit exposes it to scrutiny and shifting investor sentiment in that market. Future rate cuts stand to reduce the firm’s ability to charge borrowers more on floating-rate loans.

Article content

“As base rates come down and as spreads tighten, some of the very high returns that were achieved being a senior lender in private credit, that’s harder to do,” Gray said in a separate interview on Bloomberg TV.

Article content

“By definition, when rates come down, that impacts yield,” Gray said on the call. But private-credit investors will ultimately understand that they can still get a “meaningful premium” to public markets, he added.

AI Boom

Article content

Across the firm, profit available to shareholders jumped to $1.89 billion, or $1.52 a share, beating the $1.22 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Blackstone more than doubled its haul from selling investments in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. It also took three companies public.

Article content

Blackstone’s highest-performing strategy during the third quarter was infrastructure, which delivered a 5.2% return. The firm has bet big on data centers, energy and the grid — areas that could be the “picks and shovels” that drive AI.

Article content

Unlike the dot-com boom of the 2000s, “the companies who are leading this era right now, for the most part, are highly profitable, large-cap companies with pristine balance sheets,” Gray said.

Article content

At the same time, the arrival of transformative technology “invariably causes some enthusiasm,” he said, warning that “there may be some pockets of that starting.”

Article content

Gray joined other private-credit executives in pushing back on recent comments by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who suggested that recent bank losses from subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings portend wider problems.

Article content

Tying a few troubled financings led by banks to providers of private credit seems like a stretch, Gray said.

“We don’t really understand that connection,” he said. “They all feel pretty idiosyncratic.”

JPM,Kraken Reports Q3 Revenue Surge To Nearly $650 Million Ahead Of Anticipated US IPO,Financial Services,"Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Ahead of one of the most anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) in the digital asset sector, US-based crypto exchange Kraken has reported record revenue for the third quarter (Q3) of the year.

New Kraken Exchange Milestones

In a statement released on Wednesday, Kraken revealed that its Q3 2025 revenues (net of trading costs) reached $648.0 million, marking a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter and setting a new all-time high for the company.

Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) soared to $178.6 million, a 124% increase compared to the previous quarter, with margins rising by nine points to 27.6%.

Total platform transaction volume climbed to $561.9 billion, up 23% from the previous quarter of the year, while assets on the platform grew by 34% to $59.3 billion. Kraken’s community continues to expand, with 5.2 million funded accounts reported at the end of the quarter.

These results come as Kraken prepares for its initial public offering potentially for next year. The company disclosed last month that it is in advanced discussions with a strategic investor to secure new funding at a revised valuation of approximately $20 billion.

A number of crypto firms, including, Gemini Space Station (GEMI), and Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR), are pursuing US market debuts this year, buoyed by a more favorable regulatory environment under the pro-crypto Trump administration.

Such regulatory developments led to the Nasdaq debuts of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) and Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) this year. Initial excitement surrounding their launches led to a considerable surge in their respective stocks.

Acquisition Strategy Pays Off

Kraken’s success is also supported by several acquisitions announced this year. Following the acquisition of NinjaTrader, Kraken has been expanding its derivatives offerings, with futures daily average revenue trades (DARTs) reaching 741,000 in Q3, a 42% increase from the previous quarter.

Last week, Kraken also acquired Small Exchange, a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market (DCM), which enhances its direct market-access infrastructure in the US,

Looking ahead, Kraken emphasized that its Q3 2025 results not only reflect strong financial performance but also the company’s commitment to shaping systems that will define the future of finance. “We are building what legacy financial systems were not designed to achieve,” the statement noted.

Our goal is to connect our infrastructure into a single digital network where capital moves seamlessly across asset classes, time zones, and use cases. This system will enable clients to invest and trade anything, anywhere—instantly and securely, without friction or fragmentation. This is more than an evolution; it’s the foundation of a new global operating system built for openness, speed, and scale.

JPM,Gainers & Losers: Infosys among 6 stocks that hogged limelight on Thursday,Financial Services,"Newsmakers of D-Street

India’s benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex conceded most of their morning gains to close the session with a mild uptick. The selling pressure in heavyweights Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank did major damage. Auto stocks were also under the heat. While the broader Nifty index closed at 25,891, up 22 points or 0.09%, Sensex finished at 84,556, gaining 130 points or 0.15%. Here are 6 stocks that saw action today:

Infosys

Infosys: IT stocks surged up to 3.6% on Thursday led by Infosys amid renewed optimism around a US-India trade deal and easing tensions between the US and China. HCL Technologies, Mphasis and TCS also gained over 2%, pulling the Nifty IT index 2.2% higher.

Jain Resource Recycling

Shares of Ashish Kacholia-backed Jain Resource Recycling surged 9% to their new 52-week high of Rs 387 on the NSE, after the company reported a strong set of numbers for the second quarter of financial year FY26. The Q2 PAT jumped 88% to Rs 99 crore. The stock gave up its early gains to close 3.3% higher at Rs 366.90 as market sentiments faded after a strong opening.

Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever: Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) surged 3% to hit the day’s high of Rs 2,667 on Thursday after the company’s second-quarter earnings beat Street estimates. The company reported a consolidated PAT of Rs 2,685 crore for Q2 FY26, which was up 3.6% YoY. The stock conceded its gains towards the closing time amid profit booking and ended at Rs 2,601, up 0.4%.

Sikko Industries

Shares of small-cap company Sikko Industries surged 20% to hit their 52-week high of Rs 124 on the NSE, after the company announced a stock split in the ratio of 1:10 and a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1.

Dixon Technologies

Shares of Dixon Technologies India slipped 4% to their day’s low of Rs 15,540 today, continuing its weak trajectory following second-quarter earnings. The stock witnessed its fifth consecutive decline to finish at Rs 15,650, nearly 3% lower from the previous closing.

RIL

Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 2.3% from their day's high to hit Thursday's low of Rs 1,448.10 on the NSE after a media report suggested that the telecom-to-energy behemoth will stop importing oil from Russian oil major Rosneft.

JPM,American Airlines' fourth quarter forecast tops estimates,Financial Services,"American Airlines posted a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and its outlook for the rest of the year came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, sending the stock higher.

American expects to earn between 45 cents and 75 cents per share in the fourth quarter, above the 31 per share cents analysts expected. That brought American's full-year earnings guidance to between 65 cents and 95 cents per share, well above the projected 43 cents per share Wall Street forecast. The carrier expects its fourth-quarter capacity to grow between 3% and 5% over the same period last year.

Once a slam dunk quarter, airlines have found it harder to make money in the summer than in years past. Schools reopen earlier than they used to and some travelers opt to take bigger trips later in the year, when the weather is cooler and there are fewer crowds at many popular destinations.

American posted a net loss of $114 million, or 17 cents a share on revenue of $13.69 billion. Revenue was up 0.3% from last year. Excluding net special items of $3 million following the effect of taxes, the company had an adjusted loss per share of 17 cents.

American's third-quarter outlook in July had disappointed investors, though other carriers had also cut their profit outlooks for the year after demand dropped in early 2025 as customers weighed a slew of on-again, off-again tariffs and economic uncertainty.

An oversupply of domestic flights this year prompted carriers to trim their growth plans to avoid unprofitable flying.

Here is how American performed in the third quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:

JPM,FirstService Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results,Financial Services,"Consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $1.45 billion, a 4% increase relative to the same quarter in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA (note 1) increased 3% to $164.8 million, and Adjusted EPS (note 2) was $1.76, reflecting 8% growth over the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, FirstService reported GAAP Operating Earnings of $115.6 million, versus $125.9 million in the prior year period. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.24 in the quarter, versus $1.34 for the same quarter a year ago.

FirstService Brands revenues during the third quarter were $842.1 million, up 1% relative to the prior year period. On an organic basis, division revenues declined 4%, with reduced activity levels in our restoration and roofing operations offsetting strong growth at Century Fire Protection. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $102.1 million, compared to $105.8 million in the prior year period. Operating Earnings were $73.7 million, versus $87.1 million in the prior year quarter. Margins for the division were lower than prior year due to the negative operating leverage associated with the decline in organic revenue growth at our restoration and roofing service lines. The decrease in the Operating Earnings margin was further impacted by the comparison to an acquisition-related positive fair value adjustment on a contingent upside earn-out structure which we previously noted in the prior year quarter.

Forward-looking Statements

This press release includes or may include forward-looking statements. Much of this information can be identified by words such as “expect to,” “expected,” “will,” “estimated” or similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or events. FirstService believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements contemplated in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include: (i) general economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, impact demand for FirstService’s services and the cost of providing services; (ii) the ability of FirstService to implement its business strategy, including FirstService’s ability to acquire suitable acquisition candidates on acceptable terms and successfully integrate newly acquired businesses with its existing businesses; (iii) changes in or the failure to comply with government regulations; and (iv) other factors which are described in FirstService’s annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2024 under the heading “Risk factors” (a copy of which may be obtained at www.sedarplus.ca) and Annual Report on Form 40-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (a copy of which may be obtained at www.sec.gov), and subsequent filings (which factors are adopted herein). Forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date hereof and are subject to change. All forward-looking statements in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we do not intend, nor do we undertake any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect subsequent information, events, results or circumstances or otherwise.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings, adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax; (ii) other (income) expense; (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) acquisition-related items; and (vi) stock-based compensation expense. The Company uses Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its own operating performance, its ability to service debt, and as an integral part of its planning and reporting systems. Additionally, this measure is used in conjunction with discounted cash flow models to determine the Company’s overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA are presented as a supplemental measure because the Company believes such a measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance, due to the low capital intensity of the Company’s service operations. The Company believes this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, net earnings or cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA appears below.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted net earnings per share, adjusted for the effect, after income tax, of: (i) the non-controlling interest redemption increment; (ii) acquisition-related items; (iii) amortization expense related to intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions; and (iv) stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and enhances the comparability of operating results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for diluted net earnings per share, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating this non-GAAP measure may differ from other issuers and, accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and of diluted net earnings per share to adjusted EPS appears below.",Financial Post,2025-10-23T11:34:26Z,https://financialpost.com/globe-newswire/firstservice-reports-third-quarter-2025-results,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-24 19:39:58.210491,0.9999999999999999,
JPM,Beiersdorf Downgrades FY Guidance as Skin Care Market Decelerates,Financial Services,"PARIS — Beiersdorf AG stock held steady Thursday hours after the German beauty giant downgraded its consumer business’ sales growth, due to the ongoing slowdown of the skin care market.

“We saw a further deceleration of the skin care market in the third quarter of 2025, especially in emerging markets, which is why we now expect an organic sales growth for our consumer business of around 2.5 percent for the full year,” Beiersdorf chief executive officer Vincent Warnery said in a statement.

The group had previously forecasted approximately 3 percent sales gains for the year.

At 1:15 p.m. CET, Beiersdorf stock was trading at 96.34, up 0.2 percent.

The maker of Nivea, La Prairie and Chantecaille products’ sales in the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, were 2.35 billion euros, down 0.9 percent on a reported basis and up 1.7 percent in like-for-like terms.

In the first nine months of the year, Beiersdorf sales reached 7.54 billion euros, a 0.1 percent dip on a reported basis and 2 percent rise in like-for-like terms. Company gains were driven by Derma results.

Beiersdorf has sought to refuel its cash-cow Nivea’s growth in today’s challenging market.

“The biggest Nivea launch of all time with our breakthrough ingredient Epicelline shows very promising early results,” Warnery said. “By broadening our skin care focus and reinforcing deodorants as a strategic growth pillar, we are strengthening Nivea’s position for long-term success. Our strategy for Nivea remains on track.”

Jefferies analyst David Hayes spotlighted a step-up in Nivea growth in September — at plus 8 percent on innovation rollout — but wrote in a note that it “only highlights the core brand is struggling [July/August around minus 4.5 percent]. The strategic reset demands investors reconsider what now? That may take time.”",WWD,2025-10-23T11:25:26Z,http://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/skin-care/beiersdorf-downgrades-guidance-skin-care-market-decelerates-1238322024/,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-24 19:39:58.341951,0.9999999999999999,

XOM,Stocks rise on upbeat earnings; Russia sanctions boost oil,Energy,"In this article:

By Amanda Cooper

LONDON (Reuters) -Global stocks got a boost on Thursday from a slew of upbeat earnings that helped counter some of the gloom on Wall Street over a lacklustre showing from tech megacaps, while oil prices surged following U.S. sanctions against Russia.

Oil jumped 5% after Washington imposed sanctions on major Russian companies Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war.

European equities shook off overnight weakness in Asia and the U.S. as a clutch of positive earnings boosted domestic indexes, leaving the STOXX 600 up 0.3% on the day.

However, MSCI's All-World index dipped 0.1%, heading for its third consecutive daily decline.

Chinese stocks closed up 0.3%, having recovered from a 1.1% drop after sources said the White House was considering a plan to curb an array of software-powered exports to China in retaliation against Beijing's latest round of rare earth export restrictions.

""With no fresh macro data to anchor sentiment, investors are leaning defensive while Trump's Asia visit (next week) stirs geopolitical nerves,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Bank in Singapore.

POSITIVE EARNINGS SURPRISES

Global equity markets are easing off record highs as corporate earnings season kicks off. While there has been some disappointment over results or outlooks from megacaps, most companies so far have beaten analysts' estimates.

Futures on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged down 0.1%, surrendering earlier gains.

Tesla, the first of the so-called Magnificent 7 to report earnings, saw shares fall around 3% in premarket trading on Thursday after missing profit estimates despite record third-quarter revenue.

But there was still plenty for tech bulls to get their teeth into. A report from the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. government is in talks with several quantum-computing companies to take stakes in exchange for federal funding saw shares in IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum jump more than 20%.

Oil rose by as much as 5.5% to a two-week high of $66.04 a barrel, after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose Ukraine-related sanctions. EU countries also approved a 19th package of sanctions on Moscow that included a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports, while Britain hit Rosneft and Lukoil with sanctions last week.

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE LURE OF RATE CUTS

Helping to offset some of the angst over geopolitical flashpoints and trade tensions is the firm belief among investors that the Federal Reserve is on the verge of a rate-cutting spree. Markets show traders are banking on U.S. rates falling to 3% by June from 4% currently.

""Never underestimate the lure of a Fed that's cutting rates and also the magic words: ending QT,"" IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp said, referring to the central bank's quantitative tightening programme, under which it runs down its holdings of government bonds to help tighten credit conditions.

The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six others, was last up 0.1%. Since hitting a 3-1/2-year low in August, it has steadily edged higher, as investors have become more confident the Fed will act to protect the economy.

Gold, which is heading for its biggest weekly slide since May, was up 0.5% on the day at $4,114 an ounce. The price briefly veered towards the $4,000 mark overnight, as investors booked profits ahead of U.S. inflation data due this week.

Market musings

Tesla needs Elon's attention

For Tesla investors looking for good news during earnings season, few things are more important than CEO Elon Musk keeping his eye on the ball.

It's easy to see why: Periods when Musk has been distracted with other endeavors match up closely with weak stretches of Tesla stock performance.

Remember Musk's prolonged dalliance with Twitter that ended with him acquiring the company? That took up much of 2022, a year when Tesla fell 65%, its only annual decline since 2016 (and a deep one at that).

There was also the first few months of 2025, which saw shares cut nearly in half by mid-April as Musk took up a new role in Washington, DC as the head of DOGE. The stock has rallied significantly since he stepped away in late May.

If you're a Tesla shareholder, you probably want Elon as involved with the company as possible, even if you don't like his jokes and memes.

Well, he's been more involved lately, and relatively quiet (by his frantic social-media-posting standards). So how did that end up working out for the company's latest earnings?

It was mixed. On the bright side, the company reported record revenue that beat expectations. On the other hand, earnings per share missed forecasts. Investors elected to see the glass half empty, pushing the stock down after the report. Losses then extended to around 3% during the analyst call. The stock is still roughly the same amount lower in premarket trading today.

To put the move in context: Tesla's absolute directional move on an average day in 2025 has been 3%.

Digging deeper into Tesla's report reveals a picture of a company in transition. It did beat revenue estimates, but operating income and profit are down sharply from a year ago. EV sales are slowing — and not just for Tesla — so the company has pivoted hard towards AI, playing up ambitions around self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

In a way — given the valuation Tesla still carries, relative to the growth of its core business — the company has become just as much of an AI play as its Magnificent 7 counterparts. And who better to lead (and market) that charge than Musk?

That's how Tesla's board feels, having proposed an incentive-laden $1 trillion pay package to tie Musk to the company for years to come. The shareholder vote will be on Nov. 6, and the stakes are high. In an X post last weekend, Musk effectively threatened to leave if the package wasn't approved.

If it gets the go-ahead, it could mark an important step in ensuring Musk stays near Tesla, which has historically been a winning move for the stock.

On the move

It's been far from a straight line, but, through Wednesday, Tesla's stock was up 23% since Musk officially left his post with DOGE on May 28.

The stock has also benefited from other positive forces, most prominently the start of the Federal Reserve's latest rate-cut cycle in mid-September, after a 10-month pause.

Above all else, Musk refocusing on Tesla ensured the company would avoid testing the multiyear lows it experienced in March and April, a period marked by government distractions — as well as reports of slowing EV sales globally.

BI market mix

Options traders are having a field day with Beyond Meat. There's been record volume, and data shared with BI showed investors are still wagering on large price swings.

The IMF has a big warning. It says that stock valuations are overextended, which has the market at risk of ""disorderly corrections."" Those pullbacks could also hit the economy if they impact consumer spending, the organization said.

Gold got its comeuppance. After setting record after record and dominating all other assets for much of 2025, gold prices fell 7% in just two days. Here's why it got hit so hard.

MVP of the week

The first MVP in First Trade history is Chen Tianshi, the founder and CEO of China-based AI chip startup Cambricon Technologies, which has been called ""China's Nvidia"" by retail traders.

Cambricon (and Chen) have been major beneficiaries of China's push to ice out Nvidia and make semiconductor chips domestically. The latest example of this came during the company's quarterly earnings report, which saw a 14-fold revenue spike.

The report sent Cambricon shares on a tear this week, up 15% through Wednesday. Chen's net worth rose in tandem, going from $21.7 billion last week to $24.1 billion as of Wednesday, an increase of $2.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Forbes. He currently sits as the 94th-richest person in the world.

Chen is a human face of the ongoing trade war around semi chips, and he's poised to keep growing wealthier as long as China keeps trying to manufacture in-house.

He had a remarkable week in the market, and — as shown in the chart below — has seen his company's fortunes brighten significantly in the past three months as Trump and Xi have battled over trade policies.

Pro tip

Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets.

Today's investing idea is from Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX Advisors, and it's centered around the so-called debasement trade that we unpacked here in First Trade earlier this week. The trade is characterized by investors increasingly jumping into assets that they believe will protect them against the falling value of government bonds and fiat currencies.

In this vein, McMillan says throwing some money into both gold and bitcoin for the next 10 years could be a smart play, even after this week's historic sell-off in gold. Both assets are still up more than 45% over the last 12 months.

""This is not a shift along the demand curve for gold. This is a shift in the demand curve, meaning you've got central banks for the first time ever taking gold basically off the marketplace,"" he told Business Insider.

""It's going into vaults in China, India, Russia, and everywhere else, and it's out of circulation. It's not unlike Bitcoin being burned, frankly. And that's because people are worried about the beginning of the end of dollar hegemony,"" he continued, adding: ""Bitcoin is just a digital version of that trade.""

McMillan said both assets could more than double in value from current levels over the next decade.

""$10,000-an-ounce gold isn't insane, and neither is $250,000 bitcoin,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean it'll happen next year, but the forces behind it are strong.""

Sentiment on social media remains bullish, thanks to expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 bps next week, continuing the so-called liquidity easing cycle. Still, it's worth noting that the dollar index is continuing to exhibit bullish price action. A strengthening dollar could limit upside in BTC.

Risk proxies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) aren't supportive either. Both have recently penetrated key support levels. (Check the TA section). Meanwhile, key volume studies point to underlying weakness in the bitcoin market.

Taken together, these factors validate the persistent put bias in BTC options listed on Deribit and Standard Chartered's short-term bearish outlook.

Founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said that the recent banking funding stress and liquidity tightening are ""keeping BTC anchored and negatively impacting underlying risk dynamics."" Still, they added that the bull run is far from over, pointing to lower bond yields and economic slowdown risks as catalysts for aggressive Fed easing that could cause a ""melt up.""

In traditional markets, oil rose 4% on both sides of the Atlantic after the U.S. imposed sanctions on major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war. Increased volatility in the oil market could cause risk aversion. Stay alert!

Token Talk

By Francisco Rodrigues

Jupiter's native token, JUP, rose more than 3% in the last 24 hours after the decentralized exchange posted strong growth across key business metrics in the third quarter.

The Solana-based project is also pushing to launch its own stablecoin and prediction market.

Quarterly revenue rose 19.2% to $45.8 million, while trading volume, driven by both spot and perpetual products, jumped 71% to $242.8 billion.

Fees generated reached $121.5 million, up nearly 48% from the second quarter. Despite the growth, JUP's market cap edged down 1.5% to $1.35 billion.

Jupiter attributed the growth to new product rollouts, including its Ultra v3 trading engine and a lending protocol that the team says is one of the fastest-growing on Solana. Active wallets increased 5% to 8.4 million, and total value locked (TVL) rose 41.7% to $3.4 billion.

JUP outperformed the wider crypto market, which rose 1.6% based on the performance of the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.

Derivatives Positioning

Open interest (OI) in HYPE futures surged 17% in 24 hours, reaching a two-week high of 40.24 million HYPE. Occurring alongside a rise in price and positive funding rates, the increase indicates growing demand for leveraged bullish exposure.

OI in BTC and ETH has barely changed, a sign traders are reluctant to place bets ahead of Friday's U.S. CPI release.

Volmex's BVIV, which measures the annualized 30-day implied volatility in BTC, has pulled back slightly to 50% but remains well above the September low of 35%. The elevated level reflects persistent concerns arising from newfound risks like auto-deleveraging and liquidity issues.

Funding rates for major cryptocurrencies continue to hover near zero in a sign of balanced market conditions. XMR and BNB rates are slightly negative, indicating a bias for bearish short positions.

On Deribit, flows featured BTC put spreads. Overall, puts continue to trade at a premium to calls.

XOM,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Energy,"By Neil J Kanatt and Prerna Bedi

(Reuters) -Hasbro raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts on Thursday banking on strong demand for its digital games, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", at a time when tariff uncertainty looms over the all-important holiday season.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, risks a significant hit from the tariffs, with a recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese imports further clouding the outlook.

Hasbro said it plans to bring down its reliance on imports from China to 30% of its revenue by 2026, compared to its previous expectation of cutting it to 40% by 2027.

The company had also rolled out job cuts and a $1 billion cost-savings program earlier this year to cushion any likely hit.

""We're executing our tariff remediation playbook decisively, mitigating risk and protecting profitability,"" finance chief Gina Goetter said in a post-earnings call.

Peer Mattel maintained its annual outlook after missing third-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, as retailers delayed orders due to an uncertain economic outlook.

""Even with retailers taking a cautious approach to restocking, Hasbro's core brands — from Magic: The Gathering to Monopoly Go — are doing the heavy lifting,"" eMarketer analyst Zak Stambor said.

The company also said it expects momentum for its brands to remain strong in the current quarter, which falls in the crucial holiday sales period.

Hasbro expects annual revenue to increase by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of a mid-single-digit rise.

Shares of the toymaker, which have climbed more than 34% so far this year, were flat in early trading.

It also expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with its previous $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion forecast.

Revenue for the third quarter rose 8% to $1.39 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenue jumped 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year earlier.

Adjusted profit per share of $1.68 also topped estimates of $1.63.

The decreases in capital expenditures in Cable this quarter and year to date were a result of prioritizing our capital investments and striving to recognize capital efficiencies. Capital expenditures reflect continued investments in our infrastructure, including additional fibre deployments to increase our FTTH distribution. These investments incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an enhanced customer experience as we progress in our connected home roadmap, including service footprint expansion and upgrades to our DOCSIS 3.1 platform to evolve to DOCSIS 4.0, offering increased network resilience, stability, and faster download speeds over time.

Article content

Media

The increase in capital expenditures in Media this quarter was primarily a result of ongoing investments made to revitalize Scotiabank Arena. The decrease year to date was a result of lower Toronto Blue Jays stadium infrastructure-related expenditures associated with the Rogers Centre modernization project, and lower broadcast and digital infrastructures expenditures.

Article content

Capital intensity

Capital intensity decreased this quarter and year to date as a result of the revenue and capital expenditure changes discussed above.

The restructuring, acquisition and other costs excluding Shaw Transaction-related costs in the third quarters of 2024 and 2025 include severance and other departure-related costs associated with the targeted restructuring of our employee base, costs related to closing the MLSE Transaction, and costs related to real estate rationalization programs. In 2025, the year to date costs also include expenses directly related to completing the network transaction and an unfavourable regulatory decision related to retransmission of distant signals (see “Regulatory Developments” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more information).

Article content

1 Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on the fair value increment recognized on acquisition of Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. For purposes of calculating adjusted net income, we believe the magnitude of this depreciation and amortization, which was significantly affected by the size of the Shaw Transaction, may have no correlation to our current and ongoing operating results and affects comparability between certain periods. Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of $210 million and $651 million (2024 – $227 million and $689 million). Adjusted net income includes depreciation and amortization on the acquired Shaw property, plant and equipment and intangible assets based on Shaw’s historical cost and depreciation policies.

2 Finance costs exclude the $151 million gain on repayment of long-term debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Finance costs also exclude the $134 million and $41 million change in fair value of subsidiary equity derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Effective the second quarter of 2025 and as a result of closing the network transaction, we believe removing this amount more accurately reflects our ongoing operational results as these derivative instruments economically hedge the foreign exchange impacts of the network transaction but they are not eligible to be accounted for as hedges in accordance with IFRS. See “Financial Risk Management – Subsidiary equity derivatives” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more details on these derivative instruments.

3 Other income excludes a $5,016 million gain on revaluation of our existing investment in MLSE as a result of the MLSE Transaction.

4 Income tax expense excludes recoveries of $42 million and $194 million (2024 – recoveries of $82 million and $263 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 related to the income tax impact for adjusted items.

Article content

Effective the second quarter of 2025, as a result of the closing of the network transaction, we introduced a new non-GAAP measure – adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders. In addition to the adjustments applied to net income to calculate adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders further adjusts net income attributable to RCI shareholders by removing the impacts of foreign exchange revaluation within BNSI as the subsidiary equity derivatives we have entered into economically and effectively hedge our foreign exchange exposures arising from the investment.

Key Performance Indicators

Article content

We measure the success of our strategy using a number of key performance indicators that are defined and discussed in our 2024 Annual MD&A and this earnings release. We believe these key performance indicators allow us to appropriately measure our performance against our operating strategy and against the results of our peers and competitors. The following key performance indicators, some of which are supplementary financial measures (see “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures”), are not measurements in accordance with IFRS. They include:

Wireless;

Cable; and

no significant sports-related work stoppages or cancellations will occur;

XOM,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Energy,"Hasbro has today raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts, betting on Christmas season sales and demand for its digital gaming segment, even as macroeconomic uncertainties cast a gloom on spending among American shoppers.

Shares of the company, which also beat quarterly revenue estimates, were up about 3% in premarket trading.

The toymaker's digital titles, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", helped offset softness in its traditional toy business, which faces pressure from weak consumer demand amid persistent inflation and the Trump administration's volatile trade policy.

The company forecast fiscal-year 2025 revenue to grow by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of mid-single-digit rise and adjusted EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation - to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with the $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion range forecast earlier.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, has taken a significant hit from US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, with the recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese goods threatening to further pressurize the industry.

""We managed tariff volatility with agility, protected margins through cost productivity and pricing discipline, and continued to advance our transformation initiatives,"" Gina Goetter, chief financial officer, said in a statement.

The company's quarterly revenue of $1.39 billion beat analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Revenue in its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment rose 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year ago.

XOM,This CEO says young investors trying to protect their cash is stopping them from getting rich — here's why,Energy,"Many young investors are keeping their cash out of the stock market, and one financial expert says that could be the “biggest mistake” they make.

Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, argues that focusing too much on protecting themselves from losses can be counterintuitive to building wealth for the long term.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’

“When you’re young, worrying more about downside than upside is probably the biggest mistake,” he told CNBC in an interview published Oct. 10. (1) “You have to get rich before you focus on preserving your wealth.”

But in an economy clouded by inflation, tariffs and political uncertainty, even seasoned investors are asking: Where do I invest now?

Young investors fear the stock market

According to a Bankrate poll, among Americans who did not prefer the stock market as an investment tool, roughly 29% of Gen Z (ages 18-28) and 24% of millennials (ages 29-44) said the stock market felt too intimidating — higher shares than any other generation. (2)

Some may be retreating into cash investments (e.g., CDs, savings accounts) or bonds, thinking they’re playing it safe, however, stocks have outperformed both over time. From 1957 to 2024, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return, including dividends, of 11.84%, compared to just 5.71% for 10-year Treasury Bonds, according to data compiled by New York University.

The largest advantage young people have in terms of investing is time. Even in the face of market volatility, young investors often have decades to let their earnings compound and recoup from any short-term losses.

“When you appreciate how much time you have, you recognize the benefit of long-term compounding,” Brown said.

Even so, some investors can’t shake the feeling that 2025 may be riskier than usual. Are there ways consumers can invest in the market while limiting risk?

A more innovative way to take risks

Investing in the stock market inherently comes with risk, but there are different strategies for dealing with it.

One touted by experts is diversification. For young investors, this often means skipping individual stock picking in favour of low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the broader market. Doing so gives you exposure to a variety of sectors instead of a single company or industry. Essentially, you’re not putting all of your eggs in one basket.

Some ETFs also look beyond the U.S. stock market and invest in companies across the globe, adding further diversity.

Investors may also want to consider recession-resistant sectors — such as health care, consumer staples and utilities — which tend to hold up better when markets falter.

Being mindful of the type of account used to invest is also key, especially for new investors. For example, investing and contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income for that year, unlike investing with an ordinary brokerage account.

Blackstone Profits Soar But Lower Rates Bring Scrutiny to Credit Back to video

Blackstone’s distributable earnings surged 48% in the third quarter, fueled by a burst of investment exits from its private equity arm, according to an earnings release on Thursday.

“The cost of financing and more availability of capital is allowing the system of capital to move much faster,” President Jon Gray said in an interview.

Article content

The $1.2 trillion firm is a giant nonbank lender in its own right, with credit dominating flows in the third quarter.

Article content

Blackstone’s significant presence in private credit exposes it to scrutiny and shifting investor sentiment in that market. Future rate cuts stand to reduce the firm’s ability to charge borrowers more on floating-rate loans.

Article content

“As base rates come down and as spreads tighten, some of the very high returns that were achieved being a senior lender in private credit, that’s harder to do,” Gray said in a separate interview on Bloomberg TV.

Article content

“By definition, when rates come down, that impacts yield,” Gray said on the call. But private-credit investors will ultimately understand that they can still get a “meaningful premium” to public markets, he added.

AI Boom

Across the firm, profit available to shareholders jumped to $1.89 billion, or $1.52 a share, beating the $1.22 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Blackstone more than doubled its haul from selling investments in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. It also took three companies public.

Article content

Blackstone’s highest-performing strategy during the third quarter was infrastructure, which delivered a 5.2% return. The firm has bet big on data centers, energy and the grid — areas that could be the “picks and shovels” that drive AI.

Unlike the dot-com boom of the 2000s, “the companies who are leading this era right now, for the most part, are highly profitable, large-cap companies with pristine balance sheets,” Gray said.

At the same time, the arrival of transformative technology “invariably causes some enthusiasm,” he said, warning that “there may be some pockets of that starting.”

Gray joined other private-credit executives in pushing back on recent comments by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who suggested that recent bank losses from subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings portend wider problems.

Tying a few troubled financings led by banks to providers of private credit seems like a stretch, Gray said.

XOM,Kraken Reports Q3 Revenue Surge To Nearly $650 Million Ahead Of Anticipated US IPO,Energy,"Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Ahead of one of the most anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) in the digital asset sector, US-based crypto exchange Kraken has reported record revenue for the third quarter (Q3) of the year.

New Kraken Exchange Milestones

In a statement released on Wednesday, Kraken revealed that its Q3 2025 revenues (net of trading costs) reached $648.0 million, marking a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter and setting a new all-time high for the company.

Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) soared to $178.6 million, a 124% increase compared to the previous quarter, with margins rising by nine points to 27.6%.

Total platform transaction volume climbed to $561.9 billion, up 23% from the previous quarter of the year, while assets on the platform grew by 34% to $59.3 billion. Kraken’s community continues to expand, with 5.2 million funded accounts reported at the end of the quarter.

These results come as Kraken prepares for its initial public offering potentially for next year. The company disclosed last month that it is in advanced discussions with a strategic investor to secure new funding at a revised valuation of approximately $20 billion.

A number of crypto firms, including, Gemini Space Station (GEMI), and Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR), are pursuing US market debuts this year, buoyed by a more favorable regulatory environment under the pro-crypto Trump administration.

Such regulatory developments led to the Nasdaq debuts of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) and Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) this year. Initial excitement surrounding their launches led to a considerable surge in their respective stocks.

Acquisition Strategy Pays Off

Kraken’s success is also supported by several acquisitions announced this year. Following the acquisition of NinjaTrader, Kraken has been expanding its derivatives offerings, with futures daily average revenue trades (DARTs) reaching 741,000 in Q3, a 42% increase from the previous quarter.

Last week, Kraken also acquired Small Exchange, a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market (DCM), which enhances its direct market-access infrastructure in the US,

Looking ahead, Kraken emphasized that its Q3 2025 results not only reflect strong financial performance but also the company’s commitment to shaping systems that will define the future of finance. “We are building what legacy financial systems were not designed to achieve,” the statement noted.

Our goal is to connect our infrastructure into a single digital network where capital moves seamlessly across asset classes, time zones, and use cases. This system will enable clients to invest and trade anything, anywhere—instantly and securely, without friction or fragmentation. This is more than an evolution; it’s the foundation of a new global operating system built for openness, speed, and scale.

XOM,Gainers & Losers: Infosys among 6 stocks that hogged limelight on Thursday,Energy,"Newsmakers of D-Street

India’s benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex conceded most of their morning gains to close the session with a mild uptick. The selling pressure in heavyweights Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank did major damage. Auto stocks were also under the heat. While the broader Nifty index closed at 25,891, up 22 points or 0.09%, Sensex finished at 84,556, gaining 130 points or 0.15%. Here are 6 stocks that saw action today:

Infosys

Infosys: IT stocks surged up to 3.6% on Thursday led by Infosys amid renewed optimism around a US-India trade deal and easing tensions between the US and China. HCL Technologies, Mphasis and TCS also gained over 2%, pulling the Nifty IT index 2.2% higher.

Jain Resource Recycling

Shares of Ashish Kacholia-backed Jain Resource Recycling surged 9% to their new 52-week high of Rs 387 on the NSE, after the company reported a strong set of numbers for the second quarter of financial year FY26. The Q2 PAT jumped 88% to Rs 99 crore. The stock gave up its early gains to close 3.3% higher at Rs 366.90 as market sentiments faded after a strong opening.

Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever: Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) surged 3% to hit the day’s high of Rs 2,667 on Thursday after the company’s second-quarter earnings beat Street estimates. The company reported a consolidated PAT of Rs 2,685 crore for Q2 FY26, which was up 3.6% YoY. The stock conceded its gains towards the closing time amid profit booking and ended at Rs 2,601, up 0.4%.

Sikko Industries

Shares of small-cap company Sikko Industries surged 20% to hit their 52-week high of Rs 124 on the NSE, after the company announced a stock split in the ratio of 1:10 and a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1.

Dixon Technologies

Shares of Dixon Technologies India slipped 4% to their day’s low of Rs 15,540 today, continuing its weak trajectory following second-quarter earnings. The stock witnessed its fifth consecutive decline to finish at Rs 15,650, nearly 3% lower from the previous closing.

RIL

Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 2.3% from their day's high to hit Thursday's low of Rs 1,448.10 on the NSE after a media report suggested that the telecom-to-energy behemoth will stop importing oil from Russian oil major Rosneft.

XOM,American Airlines' fourth quarter forecast tops estimates,Energy,"American Airlines posted a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and its outlook for the rest of the year came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, sending the stock higher.

American expects to earn between 45 cents and 75 cents per share in the fourth quarter, above the 31 per share cents analysts expected. That brought American's full-year earnings guidance to between 65 cents and 95 cents per share, well above the projected 43 cents per share Wall Street forecast. The carrier expects its fourth-quarter capacity to grow between 3% and 5% over the same period last year.

Once a slam dunk quarter, airlines have found it harder to make money in the summer than in years past. Schools reopen earlier than they used to and some travelers opt to take bigger trips later in the year, when the weather is cooler and there are fewer crowds at many popular destinations.

American posted a net loss of $114 million, or 17 cents a share on revenue of $13.69 billion. Revenue was up 0.3% from last year. Excluding net special items of $3 million following the effect of taxes, the company had an adjusted loss per share of 17 cents.

American's third-quarter outlook in July had disappointed investors, though other carriers had also cut their profit outlooks for the year after demand dropped in early 2025 as customers weighed a slew of on-again, off-again tariffs and economic uncertainty.

An oversupply of domestic flights this year prompted carriers to trim their growth plans to avoid unprofitable flying.

Here is how American performed in the third quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:

XOM,FirstService Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results,Energy,"Consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $1.45 billion, a 4% increase relative to the same quarter in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA (note 1) increased 3% to $164.8 million, and Adjusted EPS (note 2) was $1.76, reflecting 8% growth over the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, FirstService reported GAAP Operating Earnings of $115.6 million, versus $125.9 million in the prior year period. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.24 in the quarter, versus $1.34 for the same quarter a year ago.

FirstService Brands revenues during the third quarter were $842.1 million, up 1% relative to the prior year period. On an organic basis, division revenues declined 4%, with reduced activity levels in our restoration and roofing operations offsetting strong growth at Century Fire Protection. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $102.1 million, compared to $105.8 million in the prior year period. Operating Earnings were $73.7 million, versus $87.1 million in the prior year quarter. Margins for the division were lower than prior year due to the negative operating leverage associated with the decline in organic revenue growth at our restoration and roofing service lines. The decrease in the Operating Earnings margin was further impacted by the comparison to an acquisition-related positive fair value adjustment on a contingent upside earn-out structure which we previously noted in the prior year quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings, adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax; (ii) other (income) expense; (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) acquisition-related items; and (vi) stock-based compensation expense. The Company uses Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its own operating performance, its ability to service debt, and as an integral part of its planning and reporting systems. Additionally, this measure is used in conjunction with discounted cash flow models to determine the Company’s overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA are presented as a supplemental measure because the Company believes such a measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance, due to the low capital intensity of the Company’s service operations. The Company believes this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, net earnings or cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA appears below.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted net earnings per share, adjusted for the effect, after income tax, of: (i) the non-controlling interest redemption increment; (ii) acquisition-related items; (iii) amortization expense related to intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions; and (iv) stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and enhances the comparability of operating results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for diluted net earnings per share, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating this non-GAAP measure may differ from other issuers and, accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers.

XOM,Beiersdorf Downgrades FY Guidance as Skin Care Market Decelerates,Energy,"PARIS — Beiersdorf AG stock held steady Thursday hours after the German beauty giant downgraded its consumer business’ sales growth, due to the ongoing slowdown of the skin care market.

“We saw a further deceleration of the skin care market in the third quarter of 2025, especially in emerging markets, which is why we now expect an organic sales growth for our consumer business of around 2.5 percent for the full year,” Beiersdorf chief executive officer Vincent Warnery said in a statement.

The group had previously forecasted approximately 3 percent sales gains for the year.

At 1:15 p.m. CET, Beiersdorf stock was trading at 96.34, up 0.2 percent.

The maker of Nivea, La Prairie and Chantecaille products’ sales in the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, were 2.35 billion euros, down 0.9 percent on a reported basis and up 1.7 percent in like-for-like terms.

In the first nine months of the year, Beiersdorf sales reached 7.54 billion euros, a 0.1 percent dip on a reported basis and 2 percent rise in like-for-like terms. Company gains were driven by Derma results.

Beiersdorf has sought to refuel its cash-cow Nivea’s growth in today’s challenging market.

“The biggest Nivea launch of all time with our breakthrough ingredient Epicelline shows very promising early results,” Warnery said. “By broadening our skin care focus and reinforcing deodorants as a strategic growth pillar, we are strengthening Nivea’s position for long-term success. Our strategy for Nivea remains on track.”

Jefferies analyst David Hayes spotlighted a step-up in Nivea growth in September — at plus 8 percent on innovation rollout — but wrote in a note that it “only highlights the core brand is struggling [July/August around minus 4.5 percent]. The strategic reset demands investors reconsider what now? That may take time.”",WWD,2025-10-23T11:25:26Z,http://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/skin-care/beiersdorf-downgrades-guidance-skin-care-market-decelerates-1238322024/,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-24 19:40:00.151672,0.9999999999999999,

JNJ,Stocks rise on upbeat earnings; Russia sanctions boost oil,Healthcare,"In this article:

By Amanda Cooper

LONDON (Reuters) -Global stocks got a boost on Thursday from a slew of upbeat earnings that helped counter some of the gloom on Wall Street over a lacklustre showing from tech megacaps, while oil prices surged following U.S. sanctions against Russia.

Oil jumped 5% after Washington imposed sanctions on major Russian companies Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war.

European equities shook off overnight weakness in Asia and the U.S. as a clutch of positive earnings boosted domestic indexes, leaving the STOXX 600 up 0.3% on the day.

However, MSCI's All-World index dipped 0.1%, heading for its third consecutive daily decline.

Chinese stocks closed up 0.3%, having recovered from a 1.1% drop after sources said the White House was considering a plan to curb an array of software-powered exports to China in retaliation against Beijing's latest round of rare earth export restrictions.

""With no fresh macro data to anchor sentiment, investors are leaning defensive while Trump's Asia visit (next week) stirs geopolitical nerves,"" said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Bank in Singapore.

POSITIVE EARNINGS SURPRISES

Global equity markets are easing off record highs as corporate earnings season kicks off. While there has been some disappointment over results or outlooks from megacaps, most companies so far have beaten analysts' estimates.

Futures on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged down 0.1%, surrendering earlier gains.

Tesla, the first of the so-called Magnificent 7 to report earnings, saw shares fall around 3% in premarket trading on Thursday after missing profit estimates despite record third-quarter revenue.

But there was still plenty for tech bulls to get their teeth into. A report from the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. government is in talks with several quantum-computing companies to take stakes in exchange for federal funding saw shares in IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum jump more than 20%.

Oil rose by as much as 5.5% to a two-week high of $66.04 a barrel, after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose Ukraine-related sanctions. EU countries also approved a 19th package of sanctions on Moscow that included a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports, while Britain hit Rosneft and Lukoil with sanctions last week.

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE LURE OF RATE CUTS

Helping to offset some of the angst over geopolitical flashpoints and trade tensions is the firm belief among investors that the Federal Reserve is on the verge of a rate-cutting spree. Markets show traders are banking on U.S. rates falling to 3% by June from 4% currently.

""Never underestimate the lure of a Fed that's cutting rates and also the magic words: ending QT,"" IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp said, referring to the central bank's quantitative tightening programme, under which it runs down its holdings of government bonds to help tighten credit conditions.

The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six others, was last up 0.1%. Since hitting a 3-1/2-year low in August, it has steadily edged higher, as investors have become more confident the Fed will act to protect the economy.

Gold, which is heading for its biggest weekly slide since May, was up 0.5% on the day at $4,114 an ounce. The price briefly veered towards the $4,000 mark overnight, as investors booked profits ahead of U.S. inflation data due this week.

Market musings

Tesla needs Elon's attention

For Tesla investors looking for good news during earnings season, few things are more important than CEO Elon Musk keeping his eye on the ball.

It's easy to see why: Periods when Musk has been distracted with other endeavors match up closely with weak stretches of Tesla stock performance.

Remember Musk's prolonged dalliance with Twitter that ended with him acquiring the company? That took up much of 2022, a year when Tesla fell 65%, its only annual decline since 2016 (and a deep one at that).

There was also the first few months of 2025, which saw shares cut nearly in half by mid-April as Musk took up a new role in Washington, DC as the head of DOGE. The stock has rallied significantly since he stepped away in late May.

If you're a Tesla shareholder, you probably want Elon as involved with the company as possible, even if you don't like his jokes and memes.

Well, he's been more involved lately, and relatively quiet (by his frantic social-media-posting standards). So how did that end up working out for the company's latest earnings?

It was mixed. On the bright side, the company reported record revenue that beat expectations. On the other hand, earnings per share missed forecasts. Investors elected to see the glass half empty, pushing the stock down after the report. Losses then extended to around 3% during the analyst call. The stock is still roughly the same amount lower in premarket trading today.

To put the move in context: Tesla's absolute directional move on an average day in 2025 has been 3%.

Digging deeper into Tesla's report reveals a picture of a company in transition. It did beat revenue estimates, but operating income and profit are down sharply from a year ago. EV sales are slowing — and not just for Tesla — so the company has pivoted hard towards AI, playing up ambitions around self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

In a way — given the valuation Tesla still carries, relative to the growth of its core business — the company has become just as much of an AI play as its Magnificent 7 counterparts. And who better to lead (and market) that charge than Musk?

That's how Tesla's board feels, having proposed an incentive-laden $1 trillion pay package to tie Musk to the company for years to come. The shareholder vote will be on Nov. 6, and the stakes are high. In an X post last weekend, Musk effectively threatened to leave if the package wasn't approved.

If it gets the go-ahead, it could mark an important step in ensuring Musk stays near Tesla, which has historically been a winning move for the stock.

On the move

It's been far from a straight line, but, through Wednesday, Tesla's stock was up 23% since Musk officially left his post with DOGE on May 28.

The stock has also benefited from other positive forces, most prominently the start of the Federal Reserve's latest rate-cut cycle in mid-September, after a 10-month pause.

Above all else, Musk refocusing on Tesla ensured the company would avoid testing the multiyear lows it experienced in March and April, a period marked by government distractions — as well as reports of slowing EV sales globally.

BI market mix

Options traders are having a field day with Beyond Meat. There's been record volume, and data shared with BI showed investors are still wagering on large price swings.

The IMF has a big warning. It says that stock valuations are overextended, which has the market at risk of ""disorderly corrections."" Those pullbacks could also hit the economy if they impact consumer spending, the organization said.

Gold got its comeuppance. After setting record after record and dominating all other assets for much of 2025, gold prices fell 7% in just two days. Here's why it got hit so hard.

MVP of the week

The first MVP in First Trade history is Chen Tianshi, the founder and CEO of China-based AI chip startup Cambricon Technologies, which has been called ""China's Nvidia"" by retail traders.

Cambricon (and Chen) have been major beneficiaries of China's push to ice out Nvidia and make semiconductor chips domestically. The latest example of this came during the company's quarterly earnings report, which saw a 14-fold revenue spike.

The report sent Cambricon shares on a tear this week, up 15% through Wednesday. Chen's net worth rose in tandem, going from $21.7 billion last week to $24.1 billion as of Wednesday, an increase of $2.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Forbes. He currently sits as the 94th-richest person in the world.

Chen is a human face of the ongoing trade war around semi chips, and he's poised to keep growing wealthier as long as China keeps trying to manufacture in-house.

He had a remarkable week in the market, and — as shown in the chart below — has seen his company's fortunes brighten significantly in the past three months as Trump and Xi have battled over trade policies.

Pro tip

Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets.

Today's investing idea is from Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX Advisors, and it's centered around the so-called debasement trade that we unpacked here in First Trade earlier this week. The trade is characterized by investors increasingly jumping into assets that they believe will protect them against the falling value of government bonds and fiat currencies.

In this vein, McMillan says throwing some money into both gold and bitcoin for the next 10 years could be a smart play, even after this week's historic sell-off in gold. Both assets are still up more than 45% over the last 12 months.

""This is not a shift along the demand curve for gold. This is a shift in the demand curve, meaning you've got central banks for the first time ever taking gold basically off the marketplace,"" he told Business Insider.

""It's going into vaults in China, India, Russia, and everywhere else, and it's out of circulation. It's not unlike Bitcoin being burned, frankly. And that's because people are worried about the beginning of the end of dollar hegemony,"" he continued, adding: ""Bitcoin is just a digital version of that trade.""

McMillan said both assets could more than double in value from current levels over the next decade.

""$10,000-an-ounce gold isn't insane, and neither is $250,000 bitcoin,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean it'll happen next year, but the forces behind it are strong.""

Sentiment on social media remains bullish, thanks to expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 bps next week, continuing the so-called liquidity easing cycle. Still, it's worth noting that the dollar index is continuing to exhibit bullish price action. A strengthening dollar could limit upside in BTC.

Risk proxies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) aren't supportive either. Both have recently penetrated key support levels. (Check the TA section). Meanwhile, key volume studies point to underlying weakness in the bitcoin market.

Taken together, these factors validate the persistent put bias in BTC options listed on Deribit and Standard Chartered's short-term bearish outlook.

Founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said that the recent banking funding stress and liquidity tightening are ""keeping BTC anchored and negatively impacting underlying risk dynamics."" Still, they added that the bull run is far from over, pointing to lower bond yields and economic slowdown risks as catalysts for aggressive Fed easing that could cause a ""melt up.""

In traditional markets, oil rose 4% on both sides of the Atlantic after the U.S. imposed sanctions on major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil over the Ukraine war. Increased volatility in the oil market could cause risk aversion. Stay alert!

Token Talk

By Francisco Rodrigues

Jupiter's native token, JUP, rose more than 3% in the last 24 hours after the decentralized exchange posted strong growth across key business metrics in the third quarter.

The Solana-based project is also pushing to launch its own stablecoin and prediction market.

Quarterly revenue rose 19.2% to $45.8 million, while trading volume, driven by both spot and perpetual products, jumped 71% to $242.8 billion.

Fees generated reached $121.5 million, up nearly 48% from the second quarter. Despite the growth, JUP's market cap edged down 1.5% to $1.35 billion.

Jupiter attributed the growth to new product rollouts, including its Ultra v3 trading engine and a lending protocol that the team says is one of the fastest-growing on Solana. Active wallets increased 5% to 8.4 million, and total value locked (TVL) rose 41.7% to $3.4 billion.

JUP outperformed the wider crypto market, which rose 1.6% based on the performance of the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index.

Derivatives Positioning

Open interest (OI) in HYPE futures surged 17% in 24 hours, reaching a two-week high of 40.24 million HYPE. Occurring alongside a rise in price and positive funding rates, the increase indicates growing demand for leveraged bullish exposure.

OI in BTC and ETH has barely changed, a sign traders are reluctant to place bets ahead of Friday's U.S. CPI release.

Volmex's BVIV, which measures the annualized 30-day implied volatility in BTC, has pulled back slightly to 50% but remains well above the September low of 35%. The elevated level reflects persistent concerns arising from newfound risks like auto-deleveraging and liquidity issues.

Funding rates for major cryptocurrencies continue to hover near zero in a sign of balanced market conditions. XMR and BNB rates are slightly negative, indicating a bias for bearish short positions.

On Deribit, flows featured BTC put spreads. Overall, puts continue to trade at a premium to calls.

JNJ,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Healthcare,"By Neil J Kanatt and Prerna Bedi

(Reuters) -Hasbro raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts on Thursday banking on strong demand for its digital games, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", at a time when tariff uncertainty looms over the all-important holiday season.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, risks a significant hit from the tariffs, with a recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese imports further clouding the outlook.

Hasbro said it plans to bring down its reliance on imports from China to 30% of its revenue by 2026, compared to its previous expectation of cutting it to 40% by 2027.

The company had also rolled out job cuts and a $1 billion cost-savings program earlier this year to cushion any likely hit.

""We're executing our tariff remediation playbook decisively, mitigating risk and protecting profitability,"" finance chief Gina Goetter said in a post-earnings call.

Peer Mattel maintained its annual outlook after missing third-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, as retailers delayed orders due to an uncertain economic outlook.

""Even with retailers taking a cautious approach to restocking, Hasbro's core brands — from Magic: The Gathering to Monopoly Go — are doing the heavy lifting,"" eMarketer analyst Zak Stambor said.

The company also said it expects momentum for its brands to remain strong in the current quarter, which falls in the crucial holiday sales period.

Hasbro expects annual revenue to increase by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of a mid-single-digit rise.

Shares of the toymaker, which have climbed more than 34% so far this year, were flat in early trading.

It also expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with its previous $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion forecast.

Revenue for the third quarter rose 8% to $1.39 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment revenue jumped 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year earlier.

Adjusted profit per share of $1.68 also topped estimates of $1.63.

TORONTO, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Rogers Communications Inc. (TSX: RCI.A and RCI.B; NYSE: RCI) today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Article content

“In the third quarter, we delivered industry-leading combined Wireless and Internet subscriber growth, underpinned by our lowest churn in over two years and healthy margins in Wireless and Cable,” said Tony Staffieri, President and CEO. “Our media and sports business also drove strong double-digit revenue growth, highlighting our world-class assets and the opportunity to unlock value for shareholders.”

Article content

Consolidated Financial Highlights

Article content

Revenue

The 26% increase in revenue this quarter and 21% increase year to date were a result of:

Article content

revenue from MLSE following the MLSE Transaction;

higher sports-related revenue due to higher Toronto Blue Jays revenue; and

higher advertising and subscriber revenue related to the launch of the Warner Bros. Discovery suite of channels.

Article content

Operating costs

The 47% increase in operating costs this quarter and 22% increase year to date were a result of:

Article content

costs incurred by MLSE following the MLSE Transaction;

higher programming costs, including those related to the launch of the Warner Bros. Discovery suite of channels, and higher production costs; and

higher Toronto Blue Jays expenses, including player payroll and game day-related costs.

Article content

Adjusted EBITDA

The decreases in adjusted EBITDA this quarter and year to date were a result of the revenue and expense changes discussed above.

Article content

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Article content

Article content

1 Includes additions to property, plant and equipment net of proceeds on disposition, but does not include expenditures for spectrum licences, additions to right-of-use assets, or assets acquired through business combinations.

2 Capital intensity is a supplementary financial measure. See “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more information about this measure, available at www.sedarplus.ca.

Article content

Cable

The decreases in capital expenditures in Cable this quarter and year to date were a result of prioritizing our capital investments and striving to recognize capital efficiencies. Capital expenditures reflect continued investments in our infrastructure, including additional fibre deployments to increase our FTTH distribution. These investments incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an enhanced customer experience as we progress in our connected home roadmap, including service footprint expansion and upgrades to our DOCSIS 3.1 platform to evolve to DOCSIS 4.0, offering increased network resilience, stability, and faster download speeds over time.

Article content

Media

The increase in capital expenditures in Media this quarter was primarily a result of ongoing investments made to revitalize Scotiabank Arena. The decrease year to date was a result of lower Toronto Blue Jays stadium infrastructure-related expenditures associated with the Rogers Centre modernization project, and lower broadcast and digital infrastructures expenditures.

Article content

Capital intensity

Capital intensity decreased this quarter and year to date as a result of the revenue and capital expenditure changes discussed above.

Article content

1 Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on the fair value increment recognized on acquisition of Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. For purposes of calculating adjusted net income, we believe the magnitude of this depreciation and amortization, which was significantly affected by the size of the Shaw Transaction, may have no correlation to our current and ongoing operating results and affects comparability between certain periods. Depreciation and amortization excludes depreciation and amortization on Shaw Transaction-related property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of $210 million and $651 million (2024 – $227 million and $689 million). Adjusted net income includes depreciation and amortization on the acquired Shaw property, plant and equipment and intangible assets based on Shaw’s historical cost and depreciation policies.

2 Finance costs exclude the $151 million gain on repayment of long-term debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Finance costs also exclude the $134 million and $41 million change in fair value of subsidiary equity derivative instruments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Effective the second quarter of 2025 and as a result of closing the network transaction, we believe removing this amount more accurately reflects our ongoing operational results as these derivative instruments economically hedge the foreign exchange impacts of the network transaction but they are not eligible to be accounted for as hedges in accordance with IFRS. See “Financial Risk Management – Subsidiary equity derivatives” in our Q3 2025 MD&A for more details on these derivative instruments.

3 Other income excludes a $5,016 million gain on revaluation of our existing investment in MLSE as a result of the MLSE Transaction.

4 Income tax expense excludes recoveries of $42 million and $194 million (2024 – recoveries of $82 million and $263 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 related to the income tax impact for adjusted items.

Article content

Effective the second quarter of 2025, as a result of the closing of the network transaction, we introduced a new non-GAAP measure – adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders. In addition to the adjustments applied to net income to calculate adjusted net income, adjusted net income attributable to RCI shareholders further adjusts net income attributable to RCI shareholders by removing the impacts of foreign exchange revaluation within BNSI as the subsidiary equity derivatives we have entered into economically and effectively hedge our foreign exchange exposures arising from the investment.

Key Performance Indicators

Article content

We measure the success of our strategy using a number of key performance indicators that are defined and discussed in our 2024 Annual MD&A and this earnings release. We believe these key performance indicators allow us to appropriately measure our performance against our operating strategy and against the results of our peers and competitors. The following key performance indicators, some of which are supplementary financial measures (see “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures”), are not measurements in accordance with IFRS. They include:

subscriber counts;

Wireless;

Cable; and

JNJ,Hasbro boosts annual forecasts on digital gaming demand,Healthcare,"Hasbro has today raised its annual revenue and core profit forecasts, betting on Christmas season sales and demand for its digital gaming segment, even as macroeconomic uncertainties cast a gloom on spending among American shoppers.

Shares of the company, which also beat quarterly revenue estimates, were up about 3% in premarket trading.

The toymaker's digital titles, including ""Magic: The Gathering"", helped offset softness in its traditional toy business, which faces pressure from weak consumer demand amid persistent inflation and the Trump administration's volatile trade policy.

The company forecast fiscal-year 2025 revenue to grow by high single digits, compared with prior expectations of mid-single-digit rise and adjusted EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation - to be between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion, compared with the $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion range forecast earlier.

The toy industry, which relies heavily on its manufacturing hubs in regions including China, has taken a significant hit from US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, with the recent threat of a 100% duty on Chinese goods threatening to further pressurize the industry.

""We managed tariff volatility with agility, protected margins through cost productivity and pricing discipline, and continued to advance our transformation initiatives,"" Gina Goetter, chief financial officer, said in a statement.

The company's quarterly revenue of $1.39 billion beat analysts' average estimate of $1.34 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Revenue in its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment rose 42%, compared to a 5% decrease a year ago.

JNJ,This CEO says young investors trying to protect their cash is stopping them from getting rich — here's why,Healthcare,"Many young investors are keeping their cash out of the stock market, and one financial expert says that could be the “biggest mistake” they make.

Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, argues that focusing too much on protecting themselves from losses can be counterintuitive to building wealth for the long term.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP

‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’

“When you’re young, worrying more about downside than upside is probably the biggest mistake,” he told CNBC in an interview published Oct. 10. (1) “You have to get rich before you focus on preserving your wealth.”

But in an economy clouded by inflation, tariffs and political uncertainty, even seasoned investors are asking: Where do I invest now?

Young investors fear the stock market

According to a Bankrate poll, among Americans who did not prefer the stock market as an investment tool, roughly 29% of Gen Z (ages 18-28) and 24% of millennials (ages 29-44) said the stock market felt too intimidating — higher shares than any other generation. (2)

Some may be retreating into cash investments (e.g., CDs, savings accounts) or bonds, thinking they’re playing it safe, however, stocks have outperformed both over time. From 1957 to 2024, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual return, including dividends, of 11.84%, compared to just 5.71% for 10-year Treasury Bonds, according to data compiled by New York University.

The largest advantage young people have in terms of investing is time. Even in the face of market volatility, young investors often have decades to let their earnings compound and recoup from any short-term losses.

“When you appreciate how much time you have, you recognize the benefit of long-term compounding,” Brown said.

Even so, some investors can’t shake the feeling that 2025 may be riskier than usual. Are there ways consumers can invest in the market while limiting risk?

A more innovative way to take risks

Investing in the stock market inherently comes with risk, but there are different strategies for dealing with it.

One touted by experts is diversification. For young investors, this often means skipping individual stock picking in favour of low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the broader market. Doing so gives you exposure to a variety of sectors instead of a single company or industry. Essentially, you’re not putting all of your eggs in one basket.

Some ETFs also look beyond the U.S. stock market and invest in companies across the globe, adding further diversity.

Investors may also want to consider recession-resistant sectors — such as health care, consumer staples and utilities — which tend to hold up better when markets falter.

Being mindful of the type of account used to invest is also key, especially for new investors. For example, investing and contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income for that year, unlike investing with an ordinary brokerage account.

Blackstone Profits Soar But Lower Rates Bring Scrutiny to Credit Back to video

Article content

Blackstone’s distributable earnings surged 48% in the third quarter, fueled by a burst of investment exits from its private equity arm, according to an earnings release on Thursday.

Article content

Article content

“The cost of financing and more availability of capital is allowing the system of capital to move much faster,” President Jon Gray said in an interview.

Article content

The $1.2 trillion firm is a giant nonbank lender in its own right, with credit dominating flows in the third quarter.

Article content

Blackstone’s significant presence in private credit exposes it to scrutiny and shifting investor sentiment in that market. Future rate cuts stand to reduce the firm’s ability to charge borrowers more on floating-rate loans.

Article content

“As base rates come down and as spreads tighten, some of the very high returns that were achieved being a senior lender in private credit, that’s harder to do,” Gray said in a separate interview on Bloomberg TV.

Article content

“By definition, when rates come down, that impacts yield,” Gray said on the call. But private-credit investors will ultimately understand that they can still get a “meaningful premium” to public markets, he added.

AI Boom

Across the firm, profit available to shareholders jumped to $1.89 billion, or $1.52 a share, beating the $1.22 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Blackstone more than doubled its haul from selling investments in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. It also took three companies public.

Article content

Blackstone’s highest-performing strategy during the third quarter was infrastructure, which delivered a 5.2% return. The firm has bet big on data centers, energy and the grid — areas that could be the “picks and shovels” that drive AI.

Article content

Unlike the dot-com boom of the 2000s, “the companies who are leading this era right now, for the most part, are highly profitable, large-cap companies with pristine balance sheets,” Gray said.

Article content

At the same time, the arrival of transformative technology “invariably causes some enthusiasm,” he said, warning that “there may be some pockets of that starting.”

Article content

Gray joined other private-credit executives in pushing back on recent comments by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who suggested that recent bank losses from subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings portend wider problems.

Tying a few troubled financings led by banks to providers of private credit seems like a stretch, Gray said.

“We don’t really understand that connection,” he said. “They all feel pretty idiosyncratic.”

JNJ,Kraken Reports Q3 Revenue Surge To Nearly $650 Million Ahead Of Anticipated US IPO,Healthcare,"Trusted Editorial content, reviewed by leading industry experts and seasoned editors. Ad Disclosure

Ahead of one of the most anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) in the digital asset sector, US-based crypto exchange Kraken has reported record revenue for the third quarter (Q3) of the year.

New Kraken Exchange Milestones

In a statement released on Wednesday, Kraken revealed that its Q3 2025 revenues (net of trading costs) reached $648.0 million, marking a 50% increase quarter-over-quarter and setting a new all-time high for the company.

Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) soared to $178.6 million, a 124% increase compared to the previous quarter, with margins rising by nine points to 27.6%.

Total platform transaction volume climbed to $561.9 billion, up 23% from the previous quarter of the year, while assets on the platform grew by 34% to $59.3 billion. Kraken’s community continues to expand, with 5.2 million funded accounts reported at the end of the quarter.

These results come as Kraken prepares for its initial public offering potentially for next year. The company disclosed last month that it is in advanced discussions with a strategic investor to secure new funding at a revised valuation of approximately $20 billion.

A number of crypto firms, including, Gemini Space Station (GEMI), and Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR), are pursuing US market debuts this year, buoyed by a more favorable regulatory environment under the pro-crypto Trump administration.

Such regulatory developments led to the Nasdaq debuts of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) and Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) this year. Initial excitement surrounding their launches led to a considerable surge in their respective stocks.

Acquisition Strategy Pays Off

Kraken’s success is also supported by several acquisitions announced this year. Following the acquisition of NinjaTrader, Kraken has been expanding its derivatives offerings, with futures daily average revenue trades (DARTs) reaching 741,000 in Q3, a 42% increase from the previous quarter.

Last week, Kraken also acquired Small Exchange, a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market (DCM), which enhances its direct market-access infrastructure in the US,

Looking ahead, Kraken emphasized that its Q3 2025 results not only reflect strong financial performance but also the company’s commitment to shaping systems that will define the future of finance. “We are building what legacy financial systems were not designed to achieve,” the statement noted.

Our goal is to connect our infrastructure into a single digital network where capital moves seamlessly across asset classes, time zones, and use cases. This system will enable clients to invest and trade anything, anywhere—instantly and securely, without friction or fragmentation. This is more than an evolution; it’s the foundation of a new global operating system built for openness, speed, and scale.

JNJ,Gainers & Losers: Infosys among 6 stocks that hogged limelight on Thursday,Healthcare,"Newsmakers of D-Street

India’s benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex conceded most of their morning gains to close the session with a mild uptick. The selling pressure in heavyweights Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank did major damage. Auto stocks were also under the heat. While the broader Nifty index closed at 25,891, up 22 points or 0.09%, Sensex finished at 84,556, gaining 130 points or 0.15%. Here are 6 stocks that saw action today:

Infosys

Infosys: IT stocks surged up to 3.6% on Thursday led by Infosys amid renewed optimism around a US-India trade deal and easing tensions between the US and China. HCL Technologies, Mphasis and TCS also gained over 2%, pulling the Nifty IT index 2.2% higher.

Jain Resource Recycling

Shares of Ashish Kacholia-backed Jain Resource Recycling surged 9% to their new 52-week high of Rs 387 on the NSE, after the company reported a strong set of numbers for the second quarter of financial year FY26. The Q2 PAT jumped 88% to Rs 99 crore. The stock gave up its early gains to close 3.3% higher at Rs 366.90 as market sentiments faded after a strong opening.

Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever: Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) surged 3% to hit the day’s high of Rs 2,667 on Thursday after the company’s second-quarter earnings beat Street estimates. The company reported a consolidated PAT of Rs 2,685 crore for Q2 FY26, which was up 3.6% YoY. The stock conceded its gains towards the closing time amid profit booking and ended at Rs 2,601, up 0.4%.

Sikko Industries

Shares of small-cap company Sikko Industries surged 20% to hit their 52-week high of Rs 124 on the NSE, after the company announced a stock split in the ratio of 1:10 and a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1.

Dixon Technologies

Shares of Dixon Technologies India slipped 4% to their day’s low of Rs 15,540 today, continuing its weak trajectory following second-quarter earnings. The stock witnessed its fifth consecutive decline to finish at Rs 15,650, nearly 3% lower from the previous closing.

RIL

Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) fell 2.3% from their day's high to hit Thursday's low of Rs 1,448.10 on the NSE after a media report suggested that the telecom-to-energy behemoth will stop importing oil from Russian oil major Rosneft.

JNJ,American Airlines' fourth quarter forecast tops estimates,Healthcare,"American Airlines posted a smaller-than-expected loss for the third quarter, and its outlook for the rest of the year came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, sending the stock higher.

American expects to earn between 45 cents and 75 cents per share in the fourth quarter, above the 31 per share cents analysts expected. That brought American's full-year earnings guidance to between 65 cents and 95 cents per share, well above the projected 43 cents per share Wall Street forecast. The carrier expects its fourth-quarter capacity to grow between 3% and 5% over the same period last year.

Once a slam dunk quarter, airlines have found it harder to make money in the summer than in years past. Schools reopen earlier than they used to and some travelers opt to take bigger trips later in the year, when the weather is cooler and there are fewer crowds at many popular destinations.

American posted a net loss of $114 million, or 17 cents a share on revenue of $13.69 billion. Revenue was up 0.3% from last year. Excluding net special items of $3 million following the effect of taxes, the company had an adjusted loss per share of 17 cents.

American's third-quarter outlook in July had disappointed investors, though other carriers had also cut their profit outlooks for the year after demand dropped in early 2025 as customers weighed a slew of on-again, off-again tariffs and economic uncertainty.

An oversupply of domestic flights this year prompted carriers to trim their growth plans to avoid unprofitable flying.

Here is how American performed in the third quarter compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG:

JNJ,FirstService Reports Third Quarter 2025 Results,Healthcare,"Consolidated revenues for the third quarter were $1.45 billion, a 4% increase relative to the same quarter in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA (note 1) increased 3% to $164.8 million, and Adjusted EPS (note 2) was $1.76, reflecting 8% growth over the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, FirstService reported GAAP Operating Earnings of $115.6 million, versus $125.9 million in the prior year period. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.24 in the quarter, versus $1.34 for the same quarter a year ago.

FirstService Brands revenues during the third quarter were $842.1 million, up 1% relative to the prior year period. On an organic basis, division revenues declined 4%, with reduced activity levels in our restoration and roofing operations offsetting strong growth at Century Fire Protection. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $102.1 million, compared to $105.8 million in the prior year period. Operating Earnings were $73.7 million, versus $87.1 million in the prior year quarter. Margins for the division were lower than prior year due to the negative operating leverage associated with the decline in organic revenue growth at our restoration and roofing service lines. The decrease in the Operating Earnings margin was further impacted by the comparison to an acquisition-related positive fair value adjustment on a contingent upside earn-out structure which we previously noted in the prior year quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings, adjusted to exclude: (i) income tax; (ii) other (income) expense; (iii) interest expense; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) acquisition-related items; and (vi) stock-based compensation expense. The Company uses Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its own operating performance, its ability to service debt, and as an integral part of its planning and reporting systems. Additionally, this measure is used in conjunction with discounted cash flow models to determine the Company’s overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA are presented as a supplemental measure because the Company believes such a measure is useful to investors as a reasonable indicator of operating performance, due to the low capital intensity of the Company’s service operations. The Company believes this measure is a financial metric used by many investors to compare companies, especially in the services industry. This measure is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP in the United States, and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, net earnings or cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s method of calculating adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA may differ from other issuers and accordingly, this measure may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers. A reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted EBITDA appears below.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted net earnings per share, adjusted for the effect, after income tax, of: (i) the non-controlling interest redemption increment; (ii) acquisition-related items; (iii) amortization expense related to intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions; and (iv) stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it provides a supplemental way to understand the underlying operating performance of the Company and enhances the comparability of operating results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is not a recognized measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as a substitute for diluted net earnings per share, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

JNJ,Beiersdorf Downgrades FY Guidance as Skin Care Market Decelerates,Healthcare,"PARIS — Beiersdorf AG stock held steady Thursday hours after the German beauty giant downgraded its consumer business’ sales growth, due to the ongoing slowdown of the skin care market.

“We saw a further deceleration of the skin care market in the third quarter of 2025, especially in emerging markets, which is why we now expect an organic sales growth for our consumer business of around 2.5 percent for the full year,” Beiersdorf chief executive officer Vincent Warnery said in a statement.

The group had previously forecasted approximately 3 percent sales gains for the year.

At 1:15 p.m. CET, Beiersdorf stock was trading at 96.34, up 0.2 percent.

The maker of Nivea, La Prairie and Chantecaille products’ sales in the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, were 2.35 billion euros, down 0.9 percent on a reported basis and up 1.7 percent in like-for-like terms.

In the first nine months of the year, Beiersdorf sales reached 7.54 billion euros, a 0.1 percent dip on a reported basis and 2 percent rise in like-for-like terms. Company gains were driven by Derma results.

Beiersdorf has sought to refuel its cash-cow Nivea’s growth in today’s challenging market.

“The biggest Nivea launch of all time with our breakthrough ingredient Epicelline shows very promising early results,” Warnery said. “By broadening our skin care focus and reinforcing deodorants as a strategic growth pillar, we are strengthening Nivea’s position for long-term success. Our strategy for Nivea remains on track.”

Jefferies analyst David Hayes spotlighted a step-up in Nivea growth in September — at plus 8 percent on innovation rollout — but wrote in a note that it “only highlights the core brand is struggling [July/August around minus 4.5 percent]. The strategic reset demands investors reconsider what now? That may take time.”",WWD,2025-10-23T11:25:26Z,http://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/skin-care/beiersdorf-downgrades-guidance-skin-care-market-decelerates-1238322024/,0.30000000000000004,2025-10-24 19:40:01.790638,0.9999999999999999,

AAPL,Should Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) Be on Your Investing Radar?,,"Launched on 09/22/2010, the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.

The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $19.96 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.

Why Large Cap Growth

Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.

While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.

Costs

Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.08%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.67%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 47.40% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Telecom round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 12.33% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).

The top 10 holdings account for about 60.28% of total assets under management.

Performance and Risk

VONG seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of large-capitalization growth stocks in the United States.

The ETF has added roughly 13.39% so far this year and was up about 24.64% in the last one year (as of 08/09/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $66.09 and $98.39.

The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 21.98% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 410 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Alternatives

Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VONG is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.

The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $127.03 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $269.82 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.

Bottom-Line

Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

AAPL,"Tesla Posts Return to Revenue Growth, Though Q3 Profits Miss Estimates",,"Key Takeaways

Tesla posted revenue growth for the third quarter after two quarters of declines.

The company, however, also turned in quarterly earnings per share that came in lower than analysts expected.

Tesla returned to revenue growth in the third quarter as buyers rushed to take advantage of expiring tax credits.

The electric vehicle maker's revenue climbed 12% year-over-year to $28.1 billion, topping analysts' expectations, in the wake of President Donald Trump's signature ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" Tesla (TSLA) said its vehicle deliveries reached a record high globally, showing ""growth across all regions."" That followed two straight quarters of decline as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities weighed on sales.

Why This Matters to Tesla Investors

A strong run of EV deliveries, many in response to the expiration of U.S. tax credits, helped power better-than-expected revenue at Tesla in the latest quarter. Enthusiasm about next-generation businesses like robots and robotaxis have pulled the stock into the black for 2025, but wariness about the car business may partly explain why it's among the lower-performing Magnificent 7 stocks this year.

However, Tesla's adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 missed the consensus estimate of $0.54 compiled by Visible Alpha. The company said it faced higher costs from restructuring and investments in AI.

The company in a shareholder letter said its Cybercab, semi truck and Megapack 3 battery products were ""on schedule"" for production at volume next year, adding that it was also installing production lines for its Optimus robots.

Shares of Tesla, the first Magnificent 7 company to report third-quarter results, were down more than 1% in extended trading following the late-Wednesday release. They were up roughly 9% for 2025 through today's close, after spending much of the year in negative territory.

Tesla has underperformed every Magnificent 7 stock so far this year except Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), the latter which is the only one in the red for 2025. It's also lagged the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) along with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq.

AAPL,"Top 2 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Plunge This Month - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN)",,"As of Oct. 24, 2025, two stocks in the communication services sector could be flashing a real warning to investors who value momentum as a key criteria in their trading decisions.

AAPL,"Going Into Earnings, Is Apple Stock a Buy, a Sell, or Fairly Valued?",,"With early optimism in iPhone 17 adoption but concerns about tariff impacts, here's what we think of Apple stock.

Apple AAPL is set to release its fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 earnings report on Oct. 30. Here's Morningstar's take on what to look for in Apple's earnings and the outlook for its stock.

With its 2-star rating, we believe Apple's stock is overvalued compared with our long-term fair value estimate of $210 per share, which implies a fiscal 2025 price/earnings multiple of 28 times, a fiscal 2025 enterprise value/revenue multiple of 7 times, and a fiscal 2025 free cash flow yield of 4%. Against our estimate of fiscal 2026 earnings, our valuation implies a price/earnings multiple of 25 times.

AAPL,"Wall Street's Week Ahead: Megacap-led earnings deluge, Fed meeting headline busy U.S. markets week",,"The U.S. stock rally confronts a potentially consequential week to keep its momentum heading into year-end, including a flood of corporate results headlined by megacap companies and a likely interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting.

U.S.-China trade tensions could come to a head in the coming days, while a persistent U.S. government shutdown further unsettles the backdrop for investors.

Stocks have weathered increased volatility this month, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, after a 35-per-cent climb since its low for the year in April. The benchmark index is up over 14 per cent year-to-date.

Given that the market has rallied for several months without a particularly significant decline, equities could remain choppy in the days ahead, said Chris Fasciano, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.

“What we need to see is continued earnings beats and corporate America talking positively about the economy,” Fasciano said. “When people start to get nervous, it’s when they see consumer confidence coming down, or business confidence coming down.” Third-quarter earnings season is off to a solid start overall, despite disappointments this week from companies such as streamer Netflix (NFLX-Q) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN-Q).

Including results from 130 companies that have reported, S&P 500 profits are estimated to have increased nearly 10 per cent from a year ago, according to LSEG IBES data as of Thursday. So far, 86 per cent of companies have topped analysts’ earnings estimates and 81 per cent have beaten revenue estimates - both higher than historically typical rates.

Next week is the busiest of the season, with over 170 companies expected to report. They include Microsoft (MSFT-Q), Apple (AAPL-Q), Alphabet (GOOGL-Q), Amazon (AMZN-Q) and Meta Platforms (META-Q), five of the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of companies with huge market capitalizations whose shares dominate equity indexes and which overall have posted outsized profit growth over the past couple of years.

Their profit edge over the rest of the index is narrowing, but the Magnificent Seven are still expected to post stronger results this period. Earnings for the group are expected to rise 16.6 per cent against an 8.1 per cent rise for the rest of the index, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG.

A number of the megacap companies are also key players in the artificial intelligence industry, enthusiasm for which has been a main driver of stock market performance.

“The factor that is probably going to have the most influence between now and the end of the year is going to be these big tech (reports),” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “The hurdle rate is very high for these companies coming into next week’s earnings.”

Other companies due to report results next week include drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY-N), oil majors Exxon (XOM-N) and Chevron (CVX-N) and payment firms Visa (V-N) and Mastercard (MA-N). The Fed is widely expected to lower its current benchmark rate of 4 per cent-4.25 per cent by another quarter percentage point when it decides on policy on Wednesday. With that already factored into asset prices, markets are likely to be more sensitive to any forward-looking language from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the central bank expected to cut rates further at its next meeting in December.

“The biggest impact would be if the Fed gave any signs that they will deviate from their rate-cutting path,” said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist for Morningstar Wealth. Possibly clouding the Fed’s decision-making ability is the lack of data provided by the government since its shutdown began on October 1, including delays in employment releases at a time of simmering worries about the health of the labor market.

An increasingly extended shutdown - which has already lasted longer than the average length of past shutdowns - also likely poses more risk to economic growth, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

“The longer it drags on, the more the market will not be able to ignore it,” Hogan said. Investors also largely had shrugged aside trade-related risks in recent months, but renewed U.S.-China rifts have brought tensions between the world’s two largest economies back to the fore.

U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month threatened significantly higher tariffs on China to take effect November 1, after Beijing imposed export controls on rare earths. Investors will be watching developments around an anticipated meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming week to see if the nations can calm tensions between them.

“If tariffs rise to the levels that President Trump is threatening on China ... you would see a more volatile and probably a more negative reaction in the market, especially if (investors) anticipate that that’s going to be lasting,” Saglimbene said.",The Globe and Mail,2025-10-24T10:16:18Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-wall-streets-week-ahead-megacap-led-earnings-deluge-fed-meeting/,0.6,2025-10-24 19:40:42.027689,,0.1686274509803922
AAPL,"Xiaomi Blames Rising Memory Chip Costs for Higher Smartphone Prices After Redmi K90 Letdown - Samsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)",,"Xiaomi Corporation (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) has attributed the rising costs of memory chips to the increased production expenses of its smartphones.

Xiaomi Trims Redmi K90 Price Amid Chip Surge

Xiaomi’s President Lu Weibing took to Weibo on Friday to address the issue of escalating memory chip prices, which have led to an increase in the production costs of the company’s handsets. The new Redmi K90 series, in particular, has been met with market disappointment due to its pricing, Reuters reported.

The base model of the Redmi K90, which was launched on Thursday, starts at 2,599 yuan ($364) for 12 GB of memory and 256 GB of storage. This is a significant increase from the 2,499 yuan ($350) price tag of its predecessor, the K80 series, launched in November 2024.

Weibing acknowledged consumer dissatisfaction with the price differences between the various configurations and announced a temporary price reduction of 300 yuan ($42.10) for the most popular K90 model, with 12 GB of memory and 512 GB of storage, bringing its price down to 2,899 yuan ($406.79) for the first month of sales.

The surge in demand for AI-focused chips has created a shortage of traditional semiconductors used in smartphones, PCs, and servers. As supply tightens, prices for those conventional chips have risen sharply — providing a windfall for memory makers like Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix.

Competition With Apple Heats Up

This development comes at a time when Xiaomi is facing renewed competition from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the Chinese market. Despite earlier challenges, Apple’s iPhone business in China has reportedly “put the worst behind it,” and the company is expected to pose a fresh challenge to Xiaomi with its 2026 iPhone lineup.

Earlier in September, Xiaomi unveiled its 17 Series in China, directly targeting Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup with bold features and competitive pricing.

In May, Xiaomi founder Lei Jun announced plans to invest at least 50 billion yuan ($6.93 billion) in chip design over a period of no less than 10 years beginning in 2021. The Apple competitor has already poured 13.5 billion yuan ($1.89 billion) into developing its advanced XringO1 mobile chip. Its chip design unit now exceeds 2,500 employees — a clear sign of Xiaomi's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone Air production but increasing production for other flagship iPhone 17 models amid strong demand, indicating a potential shift in the Chinese smartphone market.

The federal government shutdown is expected to impair consumer confidence a bit. But since government tends to impede productivity, the shutdown may actually be a plus.

Still, the National Federation of Independent Business said last Tuesday that its optimism index, a gauge of sentiment among small firms, fell by two points in September to 98.8. Economists expected sentiment to hold steady at 100.8, so the drop in sentiment came as a surprise.

Approximately 64% of small business owners said that supply-chain disruptions were affecting their business to some degree. But the index’s uncertainty component rose seven points in August to 100, the fourth-highest reading in more than 51 years. If business sentiment falls, this small business caution could impede fourth-quarter GDP growth.

On the other hand, third-quarter announcement season is off to a great start, with major financial institutions reporting better-than-expected results. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said the US economy remained resilient despite some “signs of softening, particularly in job growth.” Dimon also said that the economic impact of tariffs “have been less than people expected, including us,” adding that the final outcome of the new tariff negotiations has yet to be seen.

JPM offers a comprehensive suite of financial products and services, including consumer banking, investment banking, commercial banking, and asset and wealth management.

The bank generates revenue through interest income, fees, trading and investment activities, and asset management services across its diversified business segments.

It serves a broad client base comprising individuals, small businesses, corporations, institutional investors, and government entities worldwide.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a global leader in financial services, operating at significant scale with diversified revenue streams and a strong presence across consumer, corporate, and institutional markets. Its competitive advantage is driven by its size and breadth of offerings.

Foolish Take

Apricus Wealth’s small trim to its JPMorgan Chase stake likely reflects portfolio rebalancing after a strong run-up in the stock, rather than a shift in conviction. The bank’s shares have gained more than 30% in the past year, outpacing both the broader market and its financial peers. With that momentum, some investors appear to be taking modest profits while maintaining exposure to a strong balance sheet within a diversified financial franchise.

JPMorgan’s latest earnings reinforced its dominance in banking, posting $14.4 billion in quarterly profit ($5.07 per share) and a 20% return on tangible equity, buoyed by 14% and 25% gains in investment banking fees and markets revenue, respectively.

For long-term investors, the fundamentals remain solid. CEO Jamie Dimon’s cautious tone on global uncertainty hasn’t dampened JPMorgan’s ability to generate capital or reward shareholders—it repurchased $8 billion in stock last quarter and paid a dividend of $1.50 per share. Apricus’s move doesn’t look bearish; it looks tactical, allowing Apricus to trim exposure and lock in gains while the financial giant continues to deliver strong returns.

JPM,This Dividend Stock Had a Record Q3: Is It Too Late to Buy After the 40% YTD Surge?,,"In this article:

Citigroup (C) delivered a stellar performance in Q3 2025, with both revenues and profits easily beating estimates. Importantly, all five of its business segments posted record revenues in the quarter, and it showed good progress on the transformation plan under CEO Jane Fraser. Citi is outperforming large U.S. banking peers, including J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC), and is up over 40% for the year.

Citi’s outperformance is not just a 2025 thing, and it has risen about 150% over the last two years, which is well ahead of most of its peers. Along with the capital gains, Citi investors are also rewarded with a generous dividend yield of 2.4%, which is higher than many other large banks. In this article, we’ll examine whether Citi is still a good buy, beginning with a snapshot of the company’s Q3 earnings.

Citi Had a Record Quarter

Banks in general posted a strong set of numbers in Q3. Talking of Citi, America’s third-biggest lender, it posted revenues of $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year (YoY) and ahead of the $21.09 billion analysts expected. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 48% over the period to $2.24, while analysts were expecting the metric at $1.90. The company’s net credit losses rose 2% YoY, but total credit costs fell 8% during the period to $2.45 billion. To sum it up, it was a nice quarter for Citi, where it managed to grow its top line and bottom line while keeping delinquencies in check.

Citi Stock Forecast

After Citi’s Q3 earnings, several brokerages raised C stock’s target price, with Morgan Stanley raising its to a Street-high of $134 while maintaining its “Overweight” rating. The firm’s new estimate implies an upside of 35% over the next 12 months.

The overall Street sentiment is reasonably bullish on Citi, and of the 24 analysts covering C stock, 12 have a “Strong Buy” rating while four rate the stock as a “Moderate Buy.” The remaining eight analysts rate C as a “Hold” or some equivalent.

Citi’s Capital Allocation Policy

One of the key pillars of Citi’s transformation is efficient capital allocation. During the Q3 earnings call, Fraser said that “we are disciplined stewards of our shareholders’ capital, investing it where we should and returning what we don’t deploy.”

As part of the transformation, Citi has exited several markets, which has freed up capital and bumped up its return metrics. The company’s adjusted return on total capital employed was 9.2% in the first nine months of the year, which is now very close to the medium-term target of between 10% and 11% that the company has set. Fraser reiterated her previous views, terming the target a “waypoint, not a destination,” while adding that ""we see a lot of different areas of upside.""

The company has a $20 billion buyback program, and during Q3, it spent $5 billion on share repurchases, which was $1 billion higher than what it guided for. While Citi did not give buyback guidance for the current quarter, CFO Mark Mason hinted that the company would continue prioritizing buybacks. “While we have seen good performance in the stock over the course of the year, we’re still at and around kind of one-times tangible book value, and I think there’s more upside to the stock,” said Mason during the earnings call.

Should You Buy Citi Stock?

Citi has been a play on the transformation and the expected normalization of its valuation multiples.

The transformation has progressed nicely, as summed up by Fraser during the Q3 earnings call: “We have been relentless in our execution, and it is creating results. Over two-thirds of our transformation programs are at or are close to our target state and we are making very good progress in the remaining areas.”

Meanwhile, Citi’s outperformance has also meant that its valuation gap with peers has narrowed. C stock now trades slightly above the tangible book value of $95.72 that it reported at the end of Q3. However, it still trades below the book value per share of $108.41. I believe the next milestone in Citi’s valuation rerating would be the stock rising to its book value, which is not an unreasonable expectation given where its peers trade.

On the dividend front, the company should continue to increase the payouts even as the priority with free cash would be to repurchase shares. Overall, while not a screaming buy as it was when it traded below its tangible book value, Citi is still a decent buy, given the still-low valuations. The dividend yield remains a cherry on top and would only add to the total returns that patient investors make from the stock.

JPM,"Wall Street Banks Come to the ""Rescue"" of Milei's Argentina Just Days Before Make-or-Break Elections | naked capitalism",,"A government largely run by former JP Morgan executives takes out a loan from current JPM executives (and other US banks). What could possibly go wrong?

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon landed in Buenos Aires this week to attend an event the Wall Street lender is holding, precisely at a time that the bank is in negotiations to arrange a $20 billion loan for the Argentine government. The timing was apparently pure coincidence, given the event was organised long before talk of a rescue package, reports Bloomberg:

[B]ut it means some of the bank’s top brass will be on the ground just as doubts grow that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be able to pull off the second half of his rescue package for the Javier Milei government: a $20 billion bank-led loan.

Other Wall Street banks involved include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. If they were to activate credit lines for Argentina, it would bolster the USD 20 billion currency swap that was formalised on Monday, notes Bloomberg. Time is of the essence, however, given the country will vote in mid-term legislative elections on Sunday and the country’s peso continues to sink despite the Trump administration’s rescue package.

There’s a lot riding on the results, including that rescue package:

Dimon will be joined on his visit by the current joint chairman of JP Morgan’s International Council, Tony Blair, who will be taking a few days out from his new role as “modern-day high commissioner” of Gaza, and former US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice, who also sits on the council. On the weekend, he will take part in a polo tournament.

Before that, Dimon is expected to meet with members of Milei’s senior economic team during his stay. He should receive a warm welcome considering all four of them, including Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank Governor Santiago Busilli, are former JP Morgan Chase executives. The following photo has been doing the rounds in recent days.

What were the odds of all four of them having previously worked for the same New York-based mega lender whose operations in Argentina are apparently expanding quite nicely right now? That same bank is now helping the Milei government carry out a sovereign debt buyback operation ostensibly aimed at “reducing the country’s cost of financing and strengthening investment in education”?

An Oligarch’s Libertarian

It was Milei’s appointment of Caputo and Bausili back in December 2023 that was the obvious tell that the fix was once again in, that Milei’s government was not going to honour his main electoral pledges to abolish Argentina’s central bank or adopt the dollar. As Yannis Varoufakis argues in an excellent piece for Unherd (and as we’ve been arguing for the past two years), Milei is not a libertarian by any means but is instead beholden to Argentina’s oligarchy:

Milei never really broke with Argentina’s sad oligarchic practices of the past. He merely rebranded a type of heist practised by a long succession of his predecessors — from Peronist Carlos Menem and anti-Peronist Fernando de la Rúa to hapless Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, whose presidency lasted a mere seven days, and, more recently, neoliberal Mauricio Macri who now supports Milei. While Milei used libertarian narratives successfully to distance himself from these people, his actual policies fail the most important libertarian litmus test.

Before you, dear reader, dismiss me as a Marxist (that I admittedly am) intent on dismissing a political opponent’s success as a dismal failure (something I avoid like a mortal sin), let me put it to you in simple, libertarian terms. If you (unlike me) truly believe in the markets’ superior wisdom, and want to rid Argentina of political constraints placed on the market mechanism, which market do you liberate first? The money market, surely. Which price distortion do you drive your chainsaw through first? The fixed (or bounded) exchange rate, unquestionably. And what is the last thing you do? Precisely what Milei did: borrow zillions of dollars, pile them up on top of an already unbearable heap of public debt, to prevent the money market from choosing freely the exchange rate of your currency.

Defending a currency as weak as the peso for almost two years is, of course, a fool’s errand, and the results have been depressingly familiar. In less than two years, the Milei government has burnt through tens of billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves in a futile bid to keep the peso artificially high and, by extension, inflation artificially low. It has brought misery for the man in the street while making a mint for financial speculators.

Yes, Milei’s austerity has reduced inflation, but at the cost of smothering economic activity for two long years and squandering the country’s limited currency reserves. It is also utterly unsustainable. Everyone knows the moment the elections are over, the government will once again devalue the peso, sending inflation soaring once again — that’s why everyone is buying dollars despite the US’ direct support of the peso.

To avert an all-out currency collapse, the Milei government has needed not one, but two, massive $40 billion bailouts in the space of just six months — the first from the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank, the other from the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilisation Fund and Wall Street Banks. The half-lives of the financial interventions are growing dangerously short.

From Benign Neglect to Malign Meddling

Both of these bailouts came with big strings attached, but it is the latter that has the most onerous terms — including Trump’s exhortation to Argentine voters to choose the right party in Sunday’s election. Otherwise, he warns, the bailout funds will be withdrawn, tipping Argentina’s economy over the edge.

This, lest we forget, is occurring at the same time that the US is bombing speedboats into smithereens in both the Caribbean and the Pacific while beating the drums of war for direct military intervention in Venezuela. In recent days, it has threatened “very serious actions” against Colombia’s left-leaning governments as well as crippling tariffs against Nicaragua.

After two decades of benign neglect of Latin America (while it bombed the Middle East, Libya and Afghanistan to pieces), the US is back to its traditional practice of malign meddling in its resource-rich “backyard”. The old policy of plata o plomo (silver or lead) is back on the agenda as the Trump administration tries to drive a wedge between Latin America and China. Take the money or take a bullet: that is the option on offer.

This is not a new thing, of course. The US has been meddling in Latin America for nigh on two centuries. As Chomsky told the British journalist Seamus Milne back in 2009, US foreign policy has long been “straight out of the mafia”:

[S]ince government officials first formulated plans for a “grand area” strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s, successive administrations have been guided by a “godfather principle, straight out of the mafia: that defiance cannot be tolerated. It’s a major feature of state policy.” “Successful defiance” has to be punished, even where it damages business interests, as in the economic blockade of Cuba – in case “the contagion spreads”.

Will Trump’s overt election meddling and outright extortion practices concentrate the minds of Argentine voters, helping to tip the balance in Milei’s favour this Sunday? It’s unlikely but you never know. Milei still has millions of fanboys and girls (despite scamming thousands of them in his Libra meme coin con) and the opposition is still broadly reviled.

However, Trump’s meddling is just as likely, if not more so, to have the opposite of the intended effect. A large majority of Argentines (60%) already have a negative image of Donald J Trump while 56% have a negative image of the United States overall, according to a poll conducted for Bloomberg in April.

What’s more, the last six months of economic crisis and non-stop scandals have taken their toll on Milei’s approval ratings. The following exchange, from a recent interview of Milei on a friendly news program by Eduardo Feinmann, a presenter with a strong pro-government bias, shows just how quickly Milei’s carefully crafted image as an expert on economic matters is unravelling:

Presenter: Eighty percent of Argentineans barely make it to the end of the month, and 60 to 70% of them only make it to the 20th of the month.

Milei: How do you want me to fix that? How can I get money to the people?

Interviewer: You are the economist. You are the expert in economic growth with or without money.

In recent days, even with make-or-break elections looming, an allegedly heavily medicated Milei has refused to do any more interviews with the media, presumably at the insistence of his campaign team. As Luis Majul, another pro-government news presenter put it (emphasis my own), “Milei was going to do an interview (with us) but he took the decision not to come on in case there were questions he could not answer, which seems reasonable to me.”

An analysts’ report published by JP Morgan notes that the markets are already discounting a bad election result for Milei’s ruling Libertad Avanza party, which will make it even harder for the government to govern. However, the analysts do not rule out a sharp rebound in Argentine stocks from next week if the result exceeds expectations. As El País reported a month ago, Argentina’s stock market is the world’s worst performer in 2025.

Analysts from Wells Fargo have warned that the current exchange bands scheme “does not seem sustainable” and have predicted a further depreciation in the peso of close to 30% by the end of 2026 — the largest among all emerging currencies analysed. They also cautioned that the US Treasury’s support may offer a few days of stability – or even strength – for the Argentine peso, but it does not constitute a sustainable exchange rate policy.

In the meantime, the private sector-led rescue agreement still faces obstacles. The banks involved — including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup — are demanding clear guarantees to back the loan, either from the US Treasury or the Argentine State itself. From Perfil (translated by yours truly):

At the crux of the negotiations is the question of who will serve as guarantor of the loan: the Argentine government or the US Treasury itself. Banks are pushing for tangible backing, whether with assets, reserves or official coverage from Washington, that minimizes the risk of losses.

In this context, The Wall Street Journal points out that Argentina could offer sovereign bonds or future tax revenues as collateral, although those options are considered unviable. Local bonds are worth well below their face value, and compromising future collections could generate political rejection within the country.

Throughout history, this type of operation had solid collateral. In 1995, for example, Mexico guaranteed a $20 billion loan with oil exports during the so-called “Tequila Crisis.” By contrast, the currency swap between the Treasury and Argentina, which is also part of the $40 billion package, does not legally require collateral, increasing risks for the U.S. Treasury.

At the same time, the Trump administration is facing a gathering backlash from its MAGA base for trying to rescue Argentina, a major agricultural competitor, while the economic pain from Trump’s tariffs intensifies.

One other possible explanation that Calvi doesn’t mention is the personal and business interests of US Treasury Secretary (and former hedge fund manager) Scott Bessent. As the NYT reported a couple of weeks ago, some hedge fund managers, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both former colleagues of Bessent at Soros Asset Management, bet large on Argentina and will indirectly benefit from a financial rescue of Argentine assets.

Another major beneficiary will be the IMF, given Argentina now owes the Fund close to $60 billion. Another Argentine default, which may be inevitable anyway, could cause the institution serious embarrassment given that both of the last two bailouts, in 2018 and April 2025, were strongly opposed by senior members at the Fund, some of whom were even prepared to sacrifice their jobs rather than sign along the dotted line.

Another source of embarrassment for the Fund:

Neither the people of Argentina nor the people of the United States stand to benefit from this bailout. As reader Rabid Gandhi pointed out in a comment to Curro’s post yesterday on Latin America, the money will “barely even touch Argentine soil before being whisked away to the Caymans accounts of various hedgies and oligarchs, some of them nominally Argentines, others not even that”:

When this capital flight occurs, once again as it always has in the past, it will not be a surprise to Messers Bessent, Trump, Caputo…, because it is by design… What Argentina, the 45 million Argentines, will be getting as their ‘reward’ is a debt in USD, a central bank bereft of reserves and the concomitant austerity/cuts to social services that inevitably follow. With friends like these…

So, this leaves us with one final question: what will the Wall Street banks be asking for as collateral for its $20 billion loan? Or put another way, what does Argentina have left to plunder?

The last time the US Treasury used ESF funds to bail out another country, it was for Mexico during the 1994-5 Tequila Crisis. Not only are the Mexican people still paying off the debt for that bailout today, 27 years later, but the total amount outstanding has almost doubled in size despite the fact that the country has already paid $200 billion pesos more than the principal: the magical wonders of compound interest.

In its bailout of Mexico, the US government made sure the Mexican government put up as collateral for the loan the revenues from oil exports of Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex.

Will the Wall Street banks be demanding the same sort of treatment from Argentina’s state-owned company YPF? In its Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, Argentina boasts the world’s fourth largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China.

Such a move could be complicated, however, by a ruling issued a few months ago by US federal judge Loretta Preska — yes, the same judge who persecuted US lawyer Steven Donziger for daring to represent the people of Ecuador against Chevron — ordering the Milei government to hand over 51% of YPF to firms affected by the oil firm’s 2012 nationalisation. That ruling has been put on hold by a US appeal court but is hanging over Argentina like a sword of Damocles.

Alternatively, the Milei government could be asked to put up Argentina’s vast lithium deposits, the second largest in the world, as collateral, or even its uranium deposits. The negotiations between the Milei government and the US Treasury Department have reportedly included demands to restrict Chinese access to critical resources and prioritise agreements with U.S. companies in infrastructure and telecommunications.

The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday.

If that were to happen, Milei would effectively be stripped of the ability to rule by decree and veto, as he has done for the best part of the past two years. In which case, Bessent’s rescue package will presumably be withheld. And in that case, all bets are off.",naked capitalism,2025-10-24T10:42:44Z,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/10/wall-street-sends-in-its-big-guns-to-save-mileis-argentina-just-days-before-make-or-break-elections.html,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-24 19:40:56.792487,,0.3333333333333333
JPM,This Hot Quantum Computing Stock Keeps Climbing -- Here's What's Driving the Rally | The Motley Fool,,"Quantum computing stocks have been on a roll recently. Many popular pure-plays in the niche have surged thanks to increased investor interest, company-specific business wins, and an announcement by JPMorgan (JPM +0.15%) that it's investing in the quantum computing realm. Among them, Rigetti Computing (RGTI +9.83%) has risen by nearly 200% since the start of September.

That kind of rapid run-up may give long-term investors pause, as it looks a lot like a hype-cycle bubble. Is that the case for Rigetti, or are there real reasons to invest in the stock now?

Rigetti is selling real quantum computers right now

While Rigetti's stock has surged quite a bit over the past few weeks, it isn't without cause. It is a pure-play with no backup plan; it's quantum computing supremacy or bust. This keeps Rigetti extremely focused on that goal, while some of the legacy big tech players involved in the technology are just looking for some success in the quantum computing realm to bolster their existing businesses.

Rigetti is attempting to take on some of those legacy players head-on with the technology path that it has selected. Unlike some of its peers that are pursuing less common technological paths, Rigetti is using superconducting qubits -- one of the most well-developed and utilized qubit technologies.

When the circuits in these machines are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, they behave in ways governed by quantum mechanics, which allows them to be used to perform quantum computing calculations. This is the same approach that giants like International Business Machines and Alphabet are using, so Rigetti's solution will need to be top-notch to survive.

However, it's already showing some signs of success. Rigetti recently announced sales of two of its quantum computing systems for a total of $5.7 million. That's not a massive sale in the grand scheme of things, but it shows that Rigetti is delivering quantum computing products right now. The Asian manufacturer and California tech start-up that made those purchases likely vetted other quantum computing solutions before deciding on Rigetti's systems, so this is a vote of confidence that its technology is among the best available right now.

Another news item that likely provided some lift to the stock was JPMorgan's announcement that it plans to invest $1.1 trillion over the next decade in industries that it views as critical to national and economic security. Under the umbrella of those investments, a $10 billion fund for 27 specific industries, including quantum computing, was also announced. Rigetti's stock surged 25% following the news, despite no specific announcement that JPMorgan would even invest in it.

However, the reason the cohort of quantum computing stocks surged was that an investment by JPMorgan would add legitimacy to the space, showcasing that a legacy Wall Street institution views quantum computing not just as a futuristic and speculative technology, but as one destined to have a real future. lThis was all exciting news for Rigetti investors, but is it too late to buy the stock now?

Rigetti Computing could have more room to run

If you shift your focus from the next few months to the next decade, it's easier to see how Rigetti could still have room to run. Rigetti estimates that the total annual value for quantum computing usage will be $15 billion to $30 billion between 2030 and 2040. That's not an outlandish projection, and I think it could be a legitimate projection.

However, the industry landscape is highly competitive, and it's unlikely that one company will run away with the lion's share of the market unless its technology is vastly superior to its rivals' offerings. If we project that Rigetti Computing can capture a 25% market share by 2035 and the annual value of the quantum computing market reaches $30 billion by then, Rigetti could be generating $7.5 billion in annual sales.

It's impossible to know for certain what kind of profit margins these companies will generate, but if it can squeeze out a 30% profit margin, Rigetti Computing could generate $2.25 billion in profits. Based on all of those assumptions, and further assuming that it trades at a reasonable 30 times earnings at that point, it would be a $67.5 billion company a decade from now. Rigetti's market cap is $15 billion currently, so that would amount to 350% upside if these projections are correct.

That's solid growth over a decade, but if that projection turns out to be wrong or if Rigetti isn't one of the clear winners in the quantum computing race, it could be worth a lot less. This is a high-risk, high-potential-reward stock, and with a lot of the hoped-for wins already baked into its stock price, the risks are too high for me.",The Motley Fool,2025-10-24T11:00:00Z,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/24/hot-quantum-computing-stock-keeps-climbing-heres/,0.5,2025-10-24 19:40:50.646333,,0.1764705882352942

A JPMorgan spokesperson declined to comment.

The expansion underscores how quickly crypto is being pulled into the financial system’s core plumbing. With Bitcoin rallying this year and the Trump administration rolling back regulatory hurdles, major banks are starting to bring digital assets deeper into the lending system.

For JPMorgan, it’s both a symbolic shift and a functional one: the bank whose chief executive, Jamie Dimon, earlier dismissed Bitcoin as a “hyped-up fraud” or a “pet rock” is no longer treating crypto as a fringe bet. Instead, it will be pledged as security for a loan, the same way stocks, bonds, gold and other familiar assets are.

Lately, Dimon has moderated his stance somewhat, while remaining skeptical. “I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s investor conference in May. “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it.”

JPMorgan is far from the only established Wall Street firm to dive deeper into digital assets lately, as the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance and subsequent regulatory easing has helped them get more comfortable with the risk.

For instance, Morgan Stanley plans to allow customers on its E*Trade retail platform to access to popular cryptocurrencies beginning in the first half of next year. Other firms to get in on the action include State Street Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Fidelity, offering services like crypto custody.

A recent regulatory change also allowed firms like BlackRock Inc. to accept investors’ Bitcoin and swap them for ETF holdings tracking the token.

JPMorgan first began exploring lending against Bitcoin in 2022 but the project was later shelved, said the people, who asked not to be named because the bank’s plan is not yet public. Since then, client demand for cryptocurrency support across Wall Street has spiked as the market has grown and regulations have eased.",Yahoo!

JPM,JPMorgan to Allow Bitcoin and Ether as Collateral in Crypto Push,,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to allow institutional clients to use their holdings of Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for loans by the end of the year in a significant deepening of Wall Street’s crypto integration.

The program, offered globally, will rely on a third-party custodian to safeguard the pledged tokens, according to people familiar with the matter. It builds on JPMorgan’s earlier move to accept crypto-linked ETFs as collateral.

JPM,Blackstone's $1.2 Trillion Machine Is Back in Motion -- And Deals Are Flowing Fast,,"This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Blackstone (NYSE:BX) has reignited investor optimism after reporting a 48% surge in third-quarter distributable earnings, driven by a wave of private equity exits and renewed deal activity. The world's largest alternative asset manager posted $1.89 billion in distributable profit, or $1.52 a share, beating consensus estimates. President Jon Gray described the environment as a major inflection point, noting that the deal dam is finally breaking. With assets under management climbing to $1.2 trillion and inflows exceeding $50 billion for the fourth straight quarter, Blackstone's credit and insurance division remained the firm's anchor of growth. Despite shares being down 6.2% year-to-date, investors appear to be positioning for a cyclical rebound in private markets.

In an interview, Gray pushed back on recent comments from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who suggested that bank losses tied to subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings could hint at deeper credit cracks. Gray countered that such instances seem idiosyncratic, rather than systemic. His remarks followed a quarter where Blackstone more than doubled proceeds from asset sales compared with a year ago and took three portfolio companies public an encouraging sign that the freeze in dealmaking may be easing as financing conditions improve.

Under the surface, the firm's strategic bets on infrastructure are paying off. That segment delivered a 5.2% return, powered by investments in data centers, grid assets, and clean energy the foundational picks and shovels for the AI revolution. Gray noted that while enthusiasm around new technologies can fuel valuation spikes, today's leaders are highly profitable, large-cap companies with pristine balance sheets. With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain a gradual easing stance, and AI reshaping demand for physical and digital infrastructure, Blackstone could be entering a new phase where capital once again moves swiftly and profitably through its vast ecosystem.",Yahoo!

JPM,Stablecoins that scale: 5 tests for real-world money,,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The promises of stablecoins are clear: it’s a way to fuse the low-cost, speed, and transferability of digital assets with the certainty of traditional currency. At the upper bounds of what is possible, stablecoins may become the new standard of payment in the same way payment cards are replacing cash.

But living up to these promises means being able to scale. It’s relatively simple to make a stablecoin; it’s much less simple to make one that’s going to be just as usable at 100 transactions per day as it is at 100,000.

This was the focus of the late-morning keynote on the London Blockchain Conference’s Visionaries Stage: Stablecoins that scale: Five tests for real-world money.

The designated hitter was Dr. Berhnhard Kronfellner from Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Surveying the crowd, he muses that perhaps stablecoins don’t need five tests at all, because there’s a more useful indicator already in the room with us.

“The crowd has changed from people wearing hoodies to people that are wearing suits. So this is actually – without the five tests – the first indicator that stablecoins and digital assets have already become in the interest of the big banks, the big brands, and it will be the world’s new money.”

Nonetheless, Dr. Kronfellner sets out the five tests:

Additional value

Use cases

Revenues

Regulations

CBDC-Co-existence

To start with ‘additional value,’ Dr. Kronfellner shows two images side by side: one warped, pot-hole-stricken road, and another smooth, 20-lane megahighway. Stablecoins, in essence, are the megahighway.

In a world of innovations, things like booking overseas accommodation have been disrupted by Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) and have never been easier. But when you want to transfer money to the other side of the world, you could be looking at five banking days.

Stablecoins can do for money what Airbnb did for accommodation, in other words.

Dr. Kronfellner lists five benefits stablecoins help unlock:

Lightning-fast transactions

Reduced transaction costs

Enhanced transparency

Programmability and automation

Global accessibility and financial inclusion

He also reminded the crowd that the real use cases these benefits might transform into are still being discovered.

“When a new technology like the Internet 20 years ago—with exchanging emails, first webpages, and so on—no one had a clue that 20 years later, with Instagram, we might see influencers that have followers and make a good living out of it.”

The message is this: the use cases that we see right now, such as crypto trading, are just the beginning. Five or ten years from now, perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) agents will help us exchange money, buy things, and invest.

Another question: Are companies across the value chain building viable business models? It’s not enough to merely have a use case for stablecoins; the use case has to make money.

Some certainly are, Dr. Kronfellner explained. Tether made $13 billion in profit last year from a mere 100 employees. Little wonder, then, that banks are expending effort to enter the space.

Exactly what form the banks’ entry into stablecoins might take is an open question. Dr. Kronfellner discusses the potential avenues banks are exploring—they could offer wallets or custody, issue their own stablecoin, create a consortium with others to issue a stablecoin, issue tokenized deposits (as JPMorgan (NASDAQ: JPM) has done), or they could simply do nothing, and wait and see which coins emerge as the winners.

“For some banks, this makes sense. They will see that the revenue will be reduced and decrease in cross-border transactions or other typical stablecoin use cases and some clients will go away. But not being a first-mover, for a tier 3 bank, might be good.”

Regardless, Dr. Kronfellner says that BCG sees stablecoins as a net opportunity for banks. The downsides are reducing; the upsides are growing.

What’s next? Dr. Kronfellner says he sees a run for APYs. Soon, people will keep stablecoins in their wallets as a store of value and start questioning how they can get yields on their portfolio as they do with cash. New platforms may emerge from traditional banks or payment service providers to offer people an APY on stablecoins.

AI agents are another area Dr. Kronfellner anticipates growing: AI agents will help us to use our stablecoins in our wallets to transfer money, or we can ask our AI agent to find out if there’s a cheap way to buy into the building with X amount of money. If the apartment building is already tokenized, the AI agent will return with a quote of how much fractional ownership would cost.

Dr. Kronfellner kept returning to the same point—from the banking perspective, the upsides for stablecoins are growing, while the downsides are starting to disappear.

XOM,Exxon Mobil's Q3 2025 Earnings: What to Expect,,"Spring, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) operates as the largest American oil & gas company. It engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. and internationally. Valued at $489 billion by market cap, Exxon operates through Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments.

The energy giant is set to release its third-quarter results before the markets open on Friday, Oct. 31. Ahead of the event, analysts expect Exxon to deliver a non-GAAP profit of $1.78 per share, down nearly 7.3% from $1.92 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. On a positive note, the company has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.

For the full fiscal 2025, analysts project Exxon to deliver a non-GAAP EPS of $6.79, down 12.8% from $7.79 in fiscal 2024. However, in fiscal 2026, its earnings are expected to rebound 10.5% year-over-year to $7.50 per share.

XOM stock prices have declined 3.6% over the past 52 weeks, notably lagging behind the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLE) marginal 94 bps dip and the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 16.2% gains during the same time frame.

Exxon Mobil’s stock prices dropped 1.8% in the trading session following the release of its mixed Q2 results on Aug. 1. The quarter was marked by the highest Q2 upstream production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago. It was also the company’s best quarter yet for high-value product sales volumes in product solutions. However, due to lower commodity prices, the company’s topline for the quarter dropped 12.4% year-over-year to $81.5 billion, missing the consensus estimates by 1.6%. Meanwhile, its adjusted EPS dropped 23.4% year-over-year to $1.64, but surpassed the Street’s expectations by 10.1%.

Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about the stock’s longer-term prospects. XOM maintains a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 27 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 15 “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” 10 “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.” Its mean price target of $126.12 suggests an 8.7% upside potential from current price levels.",Barchart.com,2025-10-24T06:37:23Z,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/35653319/exxon-mobil-s-q3-2025-earnings-what-to-expect,1.0,2025-10-24 19:41:32.542114,,0.3019607843137255
XOM,3 Integrated Energy Stocks Standing Tall Despite Soft Oil Price,,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) expects rising inventories of oil to hurt crude prices. The soft crude pricing environment is thus likely to affect the integrated energy players' exploration and production operations. At the same time, the rising demand for renewable energy adds uncertainty to the prospects of the Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry, creating a bleak outlook.

Among the companies in the industry that will probably survive the business challenges are Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, Chevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP.

About the Industry

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry covers companies primarily involved in upstream, midstream and downstream operations. These companies have upstream businesses in the United States (including prolific shale plays and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico), Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and Europe. Midstream operations of energy companies entail transporting oil, natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products. In downstream businesses, the firms buy raw crude to produce refined petroleum products. The companies’ downstream activities involve chemical businesses that manufacture raw materials for making plastics. The integrated players are now gradually focusing on renewables, leading to the energy transition. The firms aim to lower emissions from operations and cut the carbon intensity of the products sold.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Industry

Soft Oil Price to Hurt Cash Flows: In its latest short-term energy outlook, EIA projected the average spot price for West Texas Intermediate crude at $65 per barrel for 2025 and $48.50 per barrel for 2026. Both the projected prices were significantly lower than $76.60 per barrel in 2024, per EIA data. The expectation for lower oil prices will probably lead to a decline in cash flows from the upstream business.

Slowdown in Production Growth to Hurt Upstream Business: There has been a slowdown in oil production growth in the upstream businesses of integrated energy companies in the United States due to shareholder demands for a greater focus on returning capital rather than investing in production expansion. As production growth slows, output decreases, which can lead to reduced revenues. Since upstream operations depend heavily on volume to generate income, any stagnation in production growth has a direct and negative impact on their bottom line.

Growing Demand for Renewables a Concern: Governments, investors and stakeholders are placing growing emphasis on addressing climate change, leading to an increased demand for renewable energy. Consequently, the demand for products reliant on oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids is expected to decline, with solar and wind energy gaining prominence in the energy landscape. The integrated energy firms are adversely impacted by these trends as they are primarily engaged in the production and transportation of fossil fuels, such as oil, and selling refined petroleum products.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish Prospects

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry is part of the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #220, which places it in the bottom 9% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Underperforms Sector and S&P 500

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.

The industry has gained 3.6% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s surge of 19% and the broader sector’s improvement of 4.8%.

One-Year Price Performance

Industry's Current Valuation

Since oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt.

On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 4.50X, lower than the S&P 500’s 18.57X. It is also below the sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 5.05X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.54X and as low as 2.75X, with a median of 4.12X.

XOM,Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Rises On US Sanctions Against Russian Oil - Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM),,"Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) shares are trading marginally higher Thursday, benefiting from a sector-wide rally after the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil. The news sent West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soaring over 5% to above $61 a barrel.

XOM is performing well relative to peers. Stay ahead of the curve here.

What To Know: These sanctions are causing XOM stock to rise due to the basic principles of supply and demand. By targeting major Russian producers, the U.S. is effectively removing a significant amount of oil from the global market. This reduction in supply, assuming demand remains constant, drives the price of crude oil higher.

For an integrated oil and gas company like Exxon Mobil, higher oil prices directly translate into greater revenue and higher profit margins for every barrel it produces and sells. Investors anticipate this boost to Exxon’s profitability, making the stock more attractive and pushing its share price upward.

Traders and investors are meanwhile watching for Exxon’s upcoming earnings report on October 31. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.81 per share on revenue of $84.87 billion for the quarter.

Benzinga Edge Rankings: According to Benzinga Edge stock rankings, the company boasts a strong Value score of 77.65.

XOM Price Action: Exxon shares were up 0.98% at $115.83 at the time of publication on Thursday. The stock is trading within its 52-week range of $97.80 to $123.21.

From a technical perspective, Exxon is trading approximately 3.1% above its 50-day moving average of $112.09 and about 5.2% above its 200-day moving average of $109.82.

These indicators suggest that the stock is in a bullish trend, with the potential for further gains if it can maintain its position above these key moving averages.

How To Buy XOM Stock

By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Exxon Mobil – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy “fractional shares,” which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.

In the case of Exxon Mobil, which is trading at $115.83 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 0.86 shares of stock.

If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to “go short” a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

XOM,"Wall Street's Week Ahead: Megacap-led earnings deluge, Fed meeting headline busy U.S. markets week",,"The U.S. stock rally confronts a potentially consequential week to keep its momentum heading into year-end, including a flood of corporate results headlined by megacap companies and a likely interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting.

U.S.-China trade tensions could come to a head in the coming days, while a persistent U.S. government shutdown further unsettles the backdrop for investors.

Stocks have weathered increased volatility this month, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, after a 35-per-cent climb since its low for the year in April. The benchmark index is up over 14 per cent year-to-date.

Given that the market has rallied for several months without a particularly significant decline, equities could remain choppy in the days ahead, said Chris Fasciano, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.

“What we need to see is continued earnings beats and corporate America talking positively about the economy,” Fasciano said. “When people start to get nervous, it’s when they see consumer confidence coming down, or business confidence coming down.” Third-quarter earnings season is off to a solid start overall, despite disappointments this week from companies such as streamer Netflix (NFLX-Q) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN-Q).

Including results from 130 companies that have reported, S&P 500 profits are estimated to have increased nearly 10 per cent from a year ago, according to LSEG IBES data as of Thursday. So far, 86 per cent of companies have topped analysts’ earnings estimates and 81 per cent have beaten revenue estimates - both higher than historically typical rates.

Next week is the busiest of the season, with over 170 companies expected to report. They include Microsoft (MSFT-Q), Apple (AAPL-Q), Alphabet (GOOGL-Q), Amazon (AMZN-Q) and Meta Platforms (META-Q), five of the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of companies with huge market capitalizations whose shares dominate equity indexes and which overall have posted outsized profit growth over the past couple of years.

Their profit edge over the rest of the index is narrowing, but the Magnificent Seven are still expected to post stronger results this period. Earnings for the group are expected to rise 16.6 per cent against an 8.1 per cent rise for the rest of the index, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG.

A number of the megacap companies are also key players in the artificial intelligence industry, enthusiasm for which has been a main driver of stock market performance.

“The factor that is probably going to have the most influence between now and the end of the year is going to be these big tech (reports),” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “The hurdle rate is very high for these companies coming into next week’s earnings.”

Other companies due to report results next week include drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY-N), oil majors Exxon (XOM-N) and Chevron (CVX-N) and payment firms Visa (V-N) and Mastercard (MA-N). The Fed is widely expected to lower its current benchmark rate of 4 per cent-4.25 per cent by another quarter percentage point when it decides on policy on Wednesday. With that already factored into asset prices, markets are likely to be more sensitive to any forward-looking language from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the central bank expected to cut rates further at its next meeting in December.

“The biggest impact would be if the Fed gave any signs that they will deviate from their rate-cutting path,” said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist for Morningstar Wealth. Possibly clouding the Fed’s decision-making ability is the lack of data provided by the government since its shutdown began on October 1, including delays in employment releases at a time of simmering worries about the health of the labor market.

An increasingly extended shutdown - which has already lasted longer than the average length of past shutdowns - also likely poses more risk to economic growth, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

“The longer it drags on, the more the market will not be able to ignore it,” Hogan said. Investors also largely had shrugged aside trade-related risks in recent months, but renewed U.S.-China rifts have brought tensions between the world’s two largest economies back to the fore.

U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month threatened significantly higher tariffs on China to take effect November 1, after Beijing imposed export controls on rare earths. Investors will be watching developments around an anticipated meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming week to see if the nations can calm tensions between them.

XOM,Why This Texas-Based Company's Stock Could Reward Long-Term Investors,,"Key Points

Exxon is one of the best companies in the global oil industry.

The energy company has a plan to deliver meaningful earnings and cash flow growth over the next several years.

It should have plenty of fuel to continue returning cash to investors.

10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobil ›

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is the undisputed leader of the global oil industry. Last quarter, its $7.1 billion of earnings and $11.5 billion of cash flow from operations led all international oil companies (IOCs). Exxon also has an industry-leading balance sheet, returned more cash to shareholders than anyone in the oil patch last quarter, and has delivered peer-leading total shareholder returns over the past five years.

The Texas-based oil giant -- Exxon's global headquarters is just north of Houston -- is in a strong position to continue rewarding its shareholders in the coming years. Here's a look at what fuels that optimistic view.

Exxon's bold plan to 2030

ExxonMobil operates under multi-year plans. Late last year, the global oil giant unveiled its plan to 2030. The company's long-term investment strategy aims to deliver an additional $20 billion in annual earnings and $30 billion in incremental cash flow by 2030. This outlook implies the company will deliver 10% compound annual earnings growth and 8% compound annual cash flow growth over the next five years. Those are solid growth rates for such a large company, especially in the volatile energy sector.

The energy company isn't banking on higher oil prices to fuel its earnings growth plan. Exxon can achieve its earnings growth target at an average Brent oil price (the global oil market benchmark) of $65 a barrel in 2030. While that's higher than the current price near $60 a barrel, Brent was over $70 a barrel at the time Exxon published its long-term outlook, and was just at its 2030 target price point a few weeks ago.

Instead, the main fuel source is Exxon's plans to invest $140 billion into high-return major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program over the next five years. Notable focus areas include expanding its world-class operations in Guyana, continuing to build out its global liquefied natural gas (LNG) capabilities, and growing its leading products solutions business by developing new petrochemical and refining projects worldwide. It's also investing in several low-carbon energy businesses, including plans to build a leading lithium business in the coming years. Exxon expects to earn returns in excess of 30% over the life of these investments.

Additionally, Exxon plans to continue executing its industry-leading structural cost savings initiative. Since 2019, Exxon has delivered $13.5 billion in structural cost savings, surpassing the total of all other IOCs combined. The company expects to achieve $18 billion in cumulative structural cost savings by 2030, further boosting its bottom line.

Returning its growing cash flow gusher to shareholders

Exxon estimates that its strategic plan can generate $165 billion in cumulative surplus cash through the end of 2030 after funding its massive capital investment target. The company has the flexibility to return most, if not all, this money to shareholders.

Exxon currently has the top balance sheet in the oil patch. The company finished the second quarter with an industry-leading net debt-to-capital ratio of 8%, bolstered by a cash balance of $15.7 billion. This provides the company with tremendous financial flexibility to continue investing in its business and returning cash to shareholders, even during periods of lower oil prices.

As a result, it will undoubtedly continue increasing its dividend, something it has done for 42 straight years. That leads the oil sector. Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have reached that level of consecutive annual dividend increases. This growth will add to Exxon's already attractive dividend, which currently yields 3.5%, nearly triple the S&P 500's level of less than 1.2%.

Additionally, Exxon will also continue to repurchase a meaningful amount of its shares each year. The company plans to repurchase $20 billion of its stock this year and a similar amount in 2026, assuming favorable market conditions. It could buy back even more shares in 2027 and beyond, especially if oil prices improve.

A potentially very enriching plan

Exxon has delivered leading total shareholder returns over the past five years by expanding its global energy business and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Looking forward, the company's clear commitment to delivering healthy earnings growth and robust capital returns puts it in a strong position to continue growing shareholder value. This high return potential makes Exxon a compelling long-term investment.

JNJ,Will Higher Royalties From Partners Fuel HALO's Growth in H2 2025?,,"Halozyme Therapeutics HALO has collaboration agreements with large pharma companies, which use its ENHANZE technology for the development of subcutaneous (SC) formulations of their various approved drugs. Halozyme now has eight marketed partnered drugs based on this technology, including the subcutaneous formulation of J&J’s JNJ Darzalex and Roche’s RHHBY Phesgo.

Per the agreements, these companies have been granted worldwide license rights to develop and commercialize their products using ENHANZE technology. These deals generate royalties on sales of marketed drugs, milestone payments and annual license fees, which comprise Halozyme’s top line.

Halozyme’s top line also comprises product sales, royalty payments from Roche for Phesgo and J&J for SC Darzalex as well as revenues under collaboration agreements related to its Enhanze technology with some large pharma companies. Total revenues in the first half of 2025 were driven by higher royalty payments from Roche for Phesgo and J&J for SC Darzalex (daratumumab), as well as argenx’s Vyvgart Hytrulo. Revenues from royalties rose 52.3% year over year to $373.8 million during the first half of 2025.

Halozyme is gearing up to report its third-quarter results on Nov. 3.

Management expects total revenues in the second half of 2025 to be driven by continued strong growth of J&J’s Darzalex SC, Roche’s Phesgo and argenx’s Vyvgart Hytrulo. Our model estimates Halozyme's revenues from royalties to increase at a CAGR of 23.2% over the next three years.

Halozyme has two commercial proprietary products, Hylenex and Xyosted, with the latter acquired from Antares Pharma in 2022. Incremental sales from these products also boosted Halozyme’s revenues during the first half of 2025.

For 2025, Halozyme projects total revenues in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.36 billion. Royalty revenues are anticipated in the range of $825-$860 million.

HALO's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates

Year to date, shares of Halozyme have rallied 37.6% compared with the industry’s rise of 10.5%. The stock has also outperformed the sector and the S&P 500 during the same time frame, as seen in the chart below.

From a valuation standpoint, Halozyme is trading at a premium to the industry. Going by the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, the company’s shares currently trade at 6.93, higher than 2.28 for the industry. The stock is trading below its five-year mean of 8.43.

JNJ,Tylenol-Maker Kenvue's Stock Is Down 30% in 2025. Its Fate May Be in the FDA's Hands.,,"Net cash flow from operating activities was another bright spot, coming in at $1 billion for the first six months of 2025, significantly higher than the previous year’s figure of $727 million. Overall, Kenvue closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.07 billion, lower than its short-term debt levels of $1.55 billion. The gap may not look material now, but the company should take steps to mitigate the decline in revenue and earnings so that its liquidity situation does not get out of hand.

Kenvue Has Been Here Before and Survived

What should give shareholders confidence is that Kenvue’s Tylenol was at the center of negative headlines before. In the 1980s, seven people died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol. But the company is still here (and now spun off from Johnson & Johnson), and so is Tylenol, with no less than a billion dollars of sales last year.

This is because Tylenol continues to stand out as a preferred over-the-counter option for pain relief in the U.S. and many other countries, backed by decades of reliable performance and user confidence. For decades, medical professionals have turned to it first for tackling everyday pains or fevers, which has built up a brand following that’s a real hurdle for anyone trying to step in.

Kenvue, meanwhile, spreads its wings globally, balancing out its footprint across different regions and lines of business to better weather economic shifts. This kind of setup lets the company bring fresh products to market more nimbly and get them circulating worldwide with less friction. Driving that forward is a strong international R&D operation, pulling together 1,600 experts across science, healthcare, pharmacy, and engineering, giving it the heft for faster iteration and development of products.

Finally, the true strength of Kenvue’s position rests on how effortlessly its products have become embedded in consumers’ everyday habits. These span core areas such as personal hygiene, skincare, cosmetics, and essential categories like oral health and infant care. As staples in routine use, the brands have achieved deep market penetration and strong consumer endorsement. This foundation allows Kenvue to maximize revenue potential from its well-established portfolio.

Nanobiotix has completed the transfer of NANORAY-312 sponsorship, initiated in 3Q2024, in the majority of regions along with the transfer of full operational control of the Phase 3 clinical trial to Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”). Following the transfer and Nanobiotix analysis of the latest information, Nanobiotix estimates that NANORAY-312 interim data will be analyzed and reported, after both the requisite number of events have been observed and the last patient has been recruited, in 1H2027.

About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)

JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel, potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global, randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.

Given the Company’s focus areas, and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3, Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy, in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad, comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.

2025-10-24 -- NBTX -- Update to NBTXR3 Clinical Program -- FINAL",Taiwan News,2025-10-24T06:41:02Z,https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6227494,0.4,2025-10-24 19:41:47.740391,,-0.08235294117647063
JNJ,NANOBIOTIX Announces Updates to JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) Clinical Program Following Transfer of Ongoing Phase 3 Head and Neck Cancer Trial Sponsorship and Operational Control - Nanobiotix (NASDAQ:NBTX),,"PARIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ:NBTX – the ‘‘Company''), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases, today announced updates to the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) clinical development program.

Nanobiotix has completed the transfer of NANORAY-312 sponsorship, initiated in 3Q2024, in the majority of regions along with the transfer of full operational control of the Phase 3 clinical trial to Johnson & Johnson (""J&J""). Following the transfer and Nanobiotix analysis of the latest information, Nanobiotix estimates that NANORAY-312 interim data will be analyzed and reported, after both the requisite number of events have been observed and the last patient has been recruited, in 1H2027.

Future guidance related to NANORAY-312 and other JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)-related J&J-sponsored studies will be communicated by J&J. Nanobiotix will continue to provide JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) clinical development updates and guidance related to Nanobiotix-sponsored studies as well as studies sponsored by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)

JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel, potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate's mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global, randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.

Given the Company's focus areas, and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3, Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy, in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad, comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023, Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, a Johnson & Johnson company.
