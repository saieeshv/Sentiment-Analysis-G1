GOOGL,1nj0sey,investing,Can I act on stock info that I overheard in a public restroom?,"Hi everyone,

I realize no one here is probably a lawyer, I'm not going to sue you if you're wrong, I just need thoughts and opinions. 

I was on vacation today and I heard someone talking loudly in the public restroom on their phone. They were not necessarily trying to conceal what they were saying.

I walked a little further and saw the name of a company that I believe they probably worked for.

Long story short, what he said on the phone made me think their stock is more likely to go down than up. He said nothing about earnings or projects, just that management of the company very broadly lacked confidence in the company at this point. 

Would it be insider trading if I bought puts on the company stock based on this information?

Edit: I've decided to pass on it for now, but I'm going to keep track of it and wonder what might have been. ",0,2025-09-17 10:09:08,2025-09-17 23:25:52.409160

TSLA,1nillod,stocks,Looking at Elon Musk's transactions for TSLA going back to 2017,"Elon's enthusiasm for this upcoming pay package ($1 trillion) vote on Nov 6th has him buying his own company's stock (link below), but I took a look at his past transactions of TSLA:

[Tracking Elon's transactions here is very interesting](https://finviz.com/insidertrading.ashx?oc=1494730&tc=7) because the last time he bought TSLA shares was between 2017 to 2020 and since then he's just been selling billions worth of TSLA shares.

I'm not saying this is the start of a new trend where Elon keeps buying TSLA shares, but he HAS stopped selling TSLA shares for about 3 years now.

I did buy TSLA shares last week when it looked like it was about to break out not knowing Elon would buy, but now I'm even more bullish.

NVDA,1niyk3r,investing,"IONQ and other Quantum stocks are rising insanely, is it worth to invest?","I noticed IONQ's presentation on investors' day, and they shared some information about achieving targets, and also had one slide where they presented the revenue, which is doubling every year. But if you look at the expenses, they are much more than the revenue they are generating. I understand it is a growth company, but I am not sure of the complete technology. So, I am trying to get some insights and want to check if you guys are aware or have any idea what they are talking about. Similarly, I noticed RGTI, QUBT, and QBTS are all going up.

|Period|Revenue|Operating Cash Flow (or Cash Flow from Operating Activities)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Q2 2025 (quarter ended June 30, 2025)**|**US$20.7 million**|**US$-85.6 million**|
|Q1 2025|Q1 revenue is $7.57 million|**US$**\-33M|
|**Full Year 2024**|**US$43.07 million**|**− US$105.68 million** approximately   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2023**|**US$22.04 million**|**US$-78.81 million**\~   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2022**|**US$11.13 million**|**US$-44.70 million**\~   operating cash flow|

I understand NVDA has gone through the same cycle at one point, but as Jensen mentioned, he was just lucky that AI happened and GPUs were useful. I am not sure if Quantum is anywhere near. It takes more than 3 years as IONQ has presented to commercialize, and I'm not sure if there is an actual application that can leverage the technology fully.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

META,1niyxh1,investing,Why today’s Nvidia–CoreWeave deal is a red flag for Oracle,"oracle pumped their stock saying ai demand is going to double. key word = *future*. they’re selling investors on what’s coming, not what’s actually happening today.

meanwhile, nvidia just cut a $6.3B deal to backstop coreweave’s unsold gpu capacity through 2032, and another $1.5B leaseback with lambda.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

so oracle’s forecast = hopium about tomorrow.  
nvidia’s actions = reality check today.

that’s a big red flag for orcl. i’m short.",160,2025-09-17 08:42:30,2025-09-17 23:26:00.670481
