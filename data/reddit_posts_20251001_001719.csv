West Red Lake Gold is executing a textbook turnaround at the Madsen Mine—a fully built but previously troubled asset now under a new, experienced team.



Key Notes: 



Timing Advantage: 



Gold demand is surging as investors and central banks pivot back to hard assets. Analysts see potential for $5,000/oz gold by 2028.



Rare Supply Story: 



New gold mines are scarce. WRLG is among the few juniors actually bringing fresh production online.



Smart Acquisition:



Madsen was acquired at a discount and is being methodically restarted with enhanced drilling, new infrastructure, and strong financial backing (Sprott, Giustra).



Fixing the Past: 



Denser drilling, better mine planning, and upgrades like the 1.4 km Connection Drift address the issues that hampered past operators.



Growth Roadmap: 



Production ramping toward \~70,000 oz annually, with upside from Rowan and Fork deposits. Longer-term, WRLG is building a hub-and-spoke Red Lake platform with >100,000 oz/yr potential.



The Setup



9,550 oz produced YTD (Jan–Jul 2025).



Mill recommissioned, ramping toward steady-state.



C$41M raise just completed, providing cushion for ramp-up, growth projects, and M&A.



With an experienced leadership team led by CEO Shane Williams, strong institutional support, and clear execution milestones, WRLG is positioning itself as one of the standout Canadian gold turnaround stories in this bull market.

I’m trying to deepen my understanding of company financials and how to extract meaningful insights about growth, profitability, and debt from annual (10-K) and quarterly (10-Q) reports. I’m particularly interested in the metrics, ratios, or qualitative information that experienced investors or analysts focus on.

	•	Which numbers or sections do you look at first to gauge sustainable growth?
	•	How do you assess profitability beyond just net income or margin?
	•	What signals do you consider most reliable when evaluating a company’s leverage or debt risk?

Any guidance, practical tips, or examples of the insights you typically extract from these filings would be highly appreciated.

West Red Lake Gold has filed its NI 43-101 technical report, formally validating the robust PEA for the Rowan Project in Ontario’s Red Lake district.

https://preview.redd.it/pd2to67nrdof1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=365f1d56a99382614146e6fe365ddeac447eddec

**Key Highlights:**

* **42% after-tax IRR** with modest initial capex (\~C$70M) through a toll milling strategy.
* Average **35,230 oz A**u/year over a 5-year mine life.
* High-grade resource: **8.0 g/t Au avg., 10.4 g/t in Year 1**, with recoveries up to 94.9%.
* Located just 80 km from the company’s operating Madsen Mine, leveraging regional infrastructure.
* Exploration upside from depth extensions, parallel veins, and new targets (Apex, Big Bend).

The filing represents a major regulatory milestone, underpinning Rowan as a capital-efficient, high-return growth asset within WRLG’s dual-mine strategy in Canada’s prolific Red Lake district.

1ncco9f,GrowthStocks,$100 → $1k? RR calls look like a 10x lotto ticket,"Alright, Fed looks poised to cut rates next week. RR’s in the Russell, so macro tailwind is strong af. Perfect setup.  
  
Markets are pricing in a \~90% chance of a 25 basis point Fed cut at the Sept 16-17 meeting, with a small (\~10%) chance of a 50bps move. That follows the mes­sage coming from the weak August jobs report and rising unemployment. It’s a really bullish macro backdrop for equities—especially those included in the Russell indexes.  
  
Today (Mon), RR’s options action was insane. Call volume clocked in at around 14K contracts, compared to only \~5K all of last week. That’s nearly 3× higher. That kind of sudden call buying spike screams “something’s brewing.”  
  
We’ve only got 2 weeks to go before the Sept 19 expiration which is also triple-witching (stock, index, and futures options all expire same day). Anything could happen to the stock price heading into that chaos.  
  
Why I’m leaning into picks right now:  
  
RR’s options have only been open for <1 week. In the last week of Aug, the stock shot up to $3.88 before a brief pullback, and today it’s back on the rise. Feels like the price hits $4+ soon.  
  
At this time before 9/19, buying calls like $4 or $5 could be a high risk/reward play. check this out: 10× $4 strike calls at $0.10 each only cost $100 total. If RR’s stock rockets past $4 into that exp week, call prices could spike, maybe $0.43 or even $1.10 this means 4 to 10× returns possibility.  
  
Plus, heavy call buying forces mms to hedge: they’ll buy the stock to offset, which adds buying pressure on RR shares themselves.  
  
Personally feels like a rare, small bet, but high return opportunity: Buy 10× $4 strike calls for $0.10? That’s $100. If RR pops, those calls could go 4× or even 10×. And if we hit $4 or above, mms hedging kicks in to help upside. Sure, it could bust and expire worthless, but at $100 total, that’s a risk I’m cool with taking for literally double digit upside potential.  
  
Stay sharp, trade smart.

1nuehsf,investing,Thoughts on plan for childrens savings,"I am looking for some advice or feedback on my current plan for my childrens money. We currently have two children (2 years old and a newborn, UK based).

My wife and I have adopted the philosophy that we should save child benefit payments and cash gifts from loved ones on special occasions, essentially treating it as their money. I am keen to let compounding work it's magic as much as possible, so my current plan is to invest it in ETFs that meet my ethical criteria (Sharia compliant, I am aware of and accept the potential lower returns). 

I'm currently planning to drip feed the current pot and future cash using a Stocks and Shares ISA on Trading 212 into:

- iShares MSCI USA (30%)
- iShares MSCI World (30%)
- iShares Physical Gold (30%)
- HSBC MSCI Europe (10%)

I do wonder if this is the ideal scenario for choosing higher risk investments, as the kids likely won't know anything about this until they're adults, but I am in no way an expert in investing, so I'm being purposely cautious with my choices (global ETFs and Gold).

1nue3zp,investing,How Wide is the Valuation Gap for L4 Players?,"I feel like autonomous vehicle is one of the stock market's most expensive and hotly contested sectors. the discussion around pure-play Level 4 tech companies and their true market capitalization is getting fascinating. A recent research note from a major international bank initiated coverage on one of the L4 players, WeRide, with an optimistic outlook. The report set a $20 target price. The bank’s reasonings:  
  
One, global reach. The company holds autonomous driving permits in a reported seven countries. This globalization focus is cited as a significant first-mover advantage, especially in international markets.  
  
Two, valuation logic. The $20 projection wasn't just a number; it was based on a discounted cash flow model. The analyst's conclusion is that the stock is 'undervalued compared to peers'.  
  
This brings up a crucial question for anyone looking at this space:  
  
Is the public market underestimating the commercialization potential and international scaling of these L4 companies? A 96% implied upside suggests the street is pricing in a much slower, tougher rollout than the analyst consensus.  
  
What's everyone's take on this? Does a target like this make you look twice at the L4 space, or do the long time-horizons and high R&D expenses make this kind of target too speculative for your portfolio right now?",1,1,2025-09-30 14:05:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nue3zp/how_wide_is_the_valuation_gap_for_l4_players/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513250

Oklo announced today that the NRC has accepted for review their Principal Design Criteria (PDC) report under an accelerated timeline. The PDC report usually defines the safety, reliability and performance requirements that will underpin future reactor licensing and design efforts. Because it’s accepted early and ahead of schedule, once approved it can be referenced in future applications- meaning that Oklo won’t have to re-defend those criteria each time, which streamlines licensing and speeds deployment.

They also noted that the NRC accepted the report in just 15 days (versus the typical 30-60 days), and **the NRC expects to issue is draft evaluation by early 2026- about half the usual review time**. Legislation and regulatory modernization efforts are cited as supporting for accelerated licensing pathways.",5,1,2025-09-30 13:43:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nudkn6/oklos_nrc_principal_design_report_accepted_for/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513256

1nu8uvl,investing,How the quantum bubble is a bigger threat than you think,"Imagine NASA going public, claiming ""interplanetary space travel and precious metal harvesting from asteroids."" Or even funnier: CERN going public and promising the future of teleportation via wormholes you could generate at home.

This is the reality of the quantum world. Research companies have gone public and started preaching: ""We will make AI 1000x faster, discover drugs that cure cancer, and our advanced trading algorithms will make you rich""

Quantum tech is a field of scientific research. Like NASA or CERN, it's a massively expensive endeavour that constantly needs more money to sustain itself. That's why some labs have gone public and now mislead investors with wild promises about the ""future"". Quantum is not an investment. It's research.

Why is quantum hype such a big threat? Because when all these investments eventually turn out to be donations, it will damage the reputation of quantum research and scientific discovery in general. Fewer grants and donations will be available to actual researchers. Worse, new unethical ""researchers"" will emerge, abusing the stock market in the name of the ""future"" yet again. This creates a vicious cycle that puts genuine scientific breakthroughs at risk.

Quantum research can transform the world, just as general relativity transformed it - from GPS to high-speed internet, which both depend on high-precision timekeeping, a child of relativity. We don't know how or when quantum discoveries will unfold. What we do know is this: researchers need to focus on research, and science must remain independent from profit as much as possible. Imagine if Albert Einstein had become the CEO of a startup instead of a scientist...

If there's any investment advice here, it's this: be careful with quantum stocks - and with any hypish ""neo-stocks"" in general.


Next time, I'll share a story about how, while working at a software company in 2015, I was part of a team that scammed investors into buying a product that was supposedly ""Powered by AI"" (history repeats)

P.S.
I don't blame the researchers who went this route. In a world where governments would rather fund war and injustice than science, people are forced to find money elsewhere. That's a much bigger problem than it seems.",81,67,2025-09-30 09:44:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu8uvl/how_the_quantum_bubble_is_a_bigger_threat_than/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513274

WFC has even gained 66%! And it's revenue hasn't moved in the last two years!!! (literally sitting at just 82 billion $ from 2023 till now TTM) Why the expected growth if the valuation metrics don't matter?

Looking at their valuation metrics they seem very overvalued. It doesn't appear to be related to an sector/industry hype, because NECB is a regional bank with solid fundamentals, yet it continues to drop without any reason/negative news. Sure I cannot compare a regional bank to worldwide bank like that, but after all we are interested in the value investing when not speculating and I don't see the value in buying 25% profit margin banks with 13-16 PE ratios. How are those banks safer bets compared to NECB with 6 PE ratio, 43% profit margin (double compared to some big banks), higher dividend (around 2 times bigger, as they just 1 month ago released a special dividend not present on the calculations) and many other metrics being better like PB and return on assets.

1nu1dma,investing,Are Municipal Bonds Liquid?,"I have been pondering if Municipal GO Bonds are liquid and why is the buying and selling process so different from other securities, such as ETFs and Stocks. 

Let me explain: I have been trying to buy a few Muni's on Fidelity and while several of the available bonds have an ""Ask"" and a Minimum listed, hardly any had any ""Bids"". Moreover, the couple that had Bids listed next to them had significant spread and when I put a bid that was HIGHER than that was listed, my orders fell through. That means the seller was unwilling to budge and could be sitting on the Munis for a long time. Hence my question about the liquidity of these securities? Or are there better trading platforms where Muni's are traded more ""efficiently"" than Fidelity Brokerage?

Anyone have any light to shed how easy it'll be to get a good price on both buy-side as well as sell-side if I got into these? Appreciate any advice.

This bond is trading at a **discount** evident by the fact that it is selling below its face value (75<100), and also because the current yield is higher than the coupon rate (when prices go down, it pushes current yield above fixed coupon!).   
The reason it is trading at a discount is because its coupon rate (3%) is less than that of similar government bonds at 4.297%. Investors aren’t willing to pay full price for it. Because of this, demand for this bond has fallen, lowering its price, until its YTM   aligns with similar bonds (RBA benchmark: 4.297% and YTM = 4.88%)   
Additionally, the YTM value is greater the the current yield indicating it is at a discount, and it shows investors will have a capital gain at maturity. *(Fernando 2022)*",1,1,2025-09-30 01:30:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nu072y/how_correct_is_my_analysis_of_this_bond/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513304

Personally, I lean in the Boglehead direction, but I'd really like to expand my knowledge and get a better idea of the overall pros and cons of both sides.

I do know that the general argument for growth over dividends is that dividends are immediately taxed and you do not control when that happens, whereas with selling appreciated stock, you have (some) control over the tax implications.

On the other hand, with dividends, I understand that there is a certain advantage to reinvesting dividends and picking up stock at a potentially lower price during lean times.

That's about the extent of my knowledge though.

Majority of my wealth is in US based tech RSU (\~60%) that has been performing above my expectations. Primarily for diversification, I want to bring it down to 30% in the next 6-8 months. Given my 20+ year timeline, I have a moderate-high risk tolerance. The new funds majorly go into IE UCITS (for estate tax and dividend efficiency).

Note: I am intentionally not seeking broad market indices for the next 5-10 years.

I'm planning to divest the 30% in this format:

|ETF|Ticker|Allocation|Reasoning/Alternative|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Russell 1000 Growth UCITS|**R1GR**|50%|Growth focus, similar to SCHG, but less concentrated than the Nasdaq 100.|

|MSCI World ex US UCITS|**EXUS**|10%|Core global diversification (similar to VXUS).|
|Momentum/Small-Cap ETFs|**SPMO/IDMO/AVDV**|25%|Split equally among these 3 for small-cap, momentum, and value exposure. (No good UCITS alternative found).|

1ntxs68,investing,Extending the DCA concept to selling an ETF to buy a stock,"Previously, we had DCA to move periodically from a fixed amount of cash to equity.

When moving from a fixed amount of equity to cash, the equivalent of DCA (dollar sell averaging??) seems to be to sell a constant number of shares periodically. (There have been other posts on that.)

In the first case, you have the cash and can always buy the shares (assume fractional shares are possible.) If you adjust the cash you spend (e.g., via Value cost averaging) you may sometimes not have the cash available.

In the second case, if you sell a variable number of shares to meet a cash point, you may come to a point where you don't have enough shares to make that. If you sell a fixed proportion of the shares, you can always sell.

Now let's throw in another variable. I have an ETF that I am going to sell and a stock I am going to buy. The ETF shares can either be correlated with the stock, or not.

What is the minimum risk strategy for making the transfer?

1. If the two equities are correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.
2. If the two equities are not correlated, do I sell a fixed number of ETF shares or a fixed value of ETF shares? The cash obtained is used to purchase the stock.

I suspect I need to write a program to simulate the various scenarios in order to answer this correctly. My intuition is leading me nowhere.",2,3,2025-09-29 23:39:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntxs68/extending_the_dca_concept_to_selling_an_etf_to/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513314

1ntwo3a,investing,1 year of investing: here is my outlook,"Hey guys I wanted to make a little list here of all of my wins and losses. My dos and donts of my personal finances.

So let's begin where ive been putting my money. Now im pretty happy with how I did it. I've had a huge sum just rotting (that's how you gotta see cash, as literally rotting) rotting in my bank account.

So step 1: get off your ass and put it in a mutual fund. ""Oh its not as good"" blah blah its better than just having it sit there and you do nothing about it. Procrastinate procrastinate... just do it.

Step 2: learn about ETFs. The more you learn about mutual funds the more you realize theyre ripping you off. So start putting your own money into a self directed investing account.

Step 2.5 (for canadians): Use TSFA or HSFA or RRSP. If you're young and make decent money, use HSFA. If you make very little money use TSFA. If you make a lot of money, use both. Remember there is a limit to how much you can put in and rules about them so go learn.

Step 3: dont start gambling. Basically you (me not you this is what I did) have no idea what youre doing and now youre just guessing what might go up or down. People on tik tok saying Costco is a buy or amazon or Google or whatever. I bought them all. I still have some but here's my rule right now: only hold what you're willing to lose. If you've got 1000 in your account then only holding 10 in Microsoft might seem like a failure since its up 19% so you might be tempted to put 200 in. But take it from me, im still holding onto stocks that ive over invested in and theyre losing. 

Step 4: go slow. You cant beat the market. Just put in money bit by bit. And if you have a big chunk of money, just put it into something safe and buy little by little every week. Set aside a reasonable amount from your paycheck and invest in the same reliable ETFs

Step 5: here is what i invest in:
40% S&P 500, (best option)
10% Gold and/or silver(market stablizer)
10% Uranium (betting on global turbulence)
20% Global markets (diversify)
20% China (risky wealth building) 

So my results after a year

My mutual fund with 60% of my money (in 1.5years) = +16%
My TSFA with 30% = +7.5%
My HSFA with 10% (8months) = +12.5%
S&P 500 = +19% (damn I really thought I did better than that)

1ntrlou,investing,Dividends + Margin Account = Growth machine?,"(TLDR at the end, this is a long post)

So I had an idea, but it feels wildly too good to be true, and before risking my assets into a fool’s errand, I’d like to aggressively stress test it. I welcome all criticism and really want to build a strongman argument for (or against) it before moving forward.

I have been wracking my brain trying to find fault in it, and while I can see some obvious pitfalls, they have yet to convince me **not** to go forward.

First for context, we have been comfortably borrowing to invest for a while, and generating great returns with a healthy mix of growth etf’s + some generally high yield dividend split corps (think bk.to). We currently have approx 40% growth compared to the initial loan size, and are now generating 18.15% aggregate yield. On the side of this, I’ve been toying with a margin account, buying in and out of healthy canadian stocks with low volatility, and selling back a few cents above for small but fun profits. Grew about 1k to 5k in the last 6 weeks doing so, but I digress.

The idea that struck me is, what if I combined the power of 15% + yield machines with the extra buying power of a margin account. And I am not JUST talking about the 3.33x leverage it would give on day one, but the realization that every single distribution that comes in would theoretically further boost our buying power by the same 3.33x.

For the sake of argument, let’s assume a simple 30k/70k scenario in which I invest 30k and obtain 100k in buying power. Let’s also temporarily ignore any stock price change for now. Out of concern for a rapid market downturn and potential margin calls, let’s also stick to never using more than 60% of the total buying power. Meaning I’m only using 60k of the 100k on day 1, keeping a (I think) healthy 40k/40% spread from my max.

This 60k, invested at 15%, would net 9k a year, or a clean 750 per month. Normally, I’d reinvest that 750 month to month, meaning each distribution actually gets rolled into the 15% calculation and the actual result by the end of the year would be slightly higher than 15% (but of course, this would potentially be negated or further amplified by the price variations that will of course happen).

Now the real kicker here is that inside a margin trading account, that 750 is actually also leveraged at 30% and thus creates 2500 in new buying power. Using the same safety formula, let’s only use 60% (1500) and reinvest THAT. Now we’re making 15% of that additional 1500 (225/18.75 per month). 

Anyone can draw up a quick excel and understand how supercharged this makes DRIP/Div reinvesting. I did one, with a bunch of different variables, where you can play with the percentage of the max buying power used (you can even start aggressively at say 80% and then tone it down to 60% over the course or x months etc.), you can play with assumed yield, initial seeding money, you can set it to reserve a portion of the unused buying power for the borrowing costs and eventual tax cost that will inevitably become hard to sustain without tapping directly into the margin, borrowing rate etc. 

All of those variables slightly affect how much, but in all scenarios, you’re greatly speeding up the compounding effect, and one can, depending on risk level, initial seeding cash vs portfolio that is being leveraged, reach the equivalent of 5x the month 1 income after only 48 months. Anyone with sufficient time, ie 5-10 years could rapidly generate silly amounts of passive income (and portfolio size).

Here are my actual numbers as of today, in a very top-heavy, start-aggressive scenario:

**Aggressive Scenario**

Initial cash: 30k

Initial Portfolio leveraged: 210k

This gives me a potential buying power of 590k.



Using 95% of it on day 1 :  560,5k @ 18.15% (my current aggregate yield) = 96 644,21$ or 8 053,68 per month. 



This means that on mo 1, the dividend unlocks an additional 26 845,61 of buying power. Because I want to rapidly reduce my risk level and increase the cushion of used margin, I do the following:



\-First account for borrowing cost and eventual owed tax on those dividends  = 698,87 + 2953,60 = 4 506,66 (the borrowing cost is actually taken off of the remaining equity, and the tax cost I’m just choosing to artificially subtract from the remaining equity).



Of the remaining amount, I then reinvest a gradually decreasing %, so having started at 95, and aiming to reduce to 75 over the course of 48 months, I’m now reinvesting 94.58% of the buying power, = 21 222,01.

At 18.15%, this bumps my annual income to 100 496,01 or 8374,67, or a difference of 320.99/mo. That’s a 3.98% “salary raise” lol. Of course this happens month after month, and because everything is compounded, the rate of increase *also* increases. By the end of mo 12, with the math explained above, I should have gone up to 147 184,01 /yr, a 52.2% increase. By the end of year 4, this amount is up to 505 566,08. You don’t want to know what it looks like after 10 years, because it makes no sense to the human brain lol. (In any case I don’T think one could get there because the size of the loan gets above 5M which seems to be the margin loan limit, at least with my current broker - at any rate, by that point, one might want to start reducing their exposure and just enjoying the proceeds of what’s left, which would put any sane person MORE than very, very comfortable.

And this is where I’m starting to doubt what my eyes and my math is telling me - I’m a little (a lot) incredulous that this could actually work, and again, I’d like to fully stress test this notion because it feels too good to be true.

A few things I’ve thought of so no one wastes time on the basics - but by all means, if I missed something else that should be obvious, do enlighten me.



**A)All of this only works so long as there is drastic market drop/recession/war/pandemic etc.** 

This is where your individual risk tolerance varies, and one could choose to start with a lower borrowing power used %, say 65%, and stick to that. This slows down the math, but doesn’t change the fundamental effect of having dividend distributions leveraged at 3.3x (and then using whatever portion you’re comfortable with) 



**B)All of this only works so long as my yield remains that high, implying that none or very few of my securities crash, reduce, or stop their distribution altogether.**

Again, mileage may vary based on your comfort level with risk, and yes, it requires a lot of watching the market for signs of trouble. There is, of course, not a single thing that guarantees safety from such an event. In our specific case, we hedge against this knowing that we have an unusually high job security, a sizeable chunk of investment that will NOT be mixed up with any of this and that covers the full borrowed amount for at the very least the early, aggressive couple of months.



**C)Ultimately, margin calls, because of the above**

Yes, they happen, yes I understand how they can happen and what it would mean, and again, keeping a comfortable cushion + having a backup source of dry-ish funds to inject if shit hits the fan is key.



**D)Ballooning debt amount and inability to actually withdraw the dividends so long as the loan is not paid off**

In my 48 year scenario above, the loan has indeed reached a terrifying size of 2,785M. Because of how margins work, I’d have to wait until dividends reduce the margin-used portion (at 505k a year it would be over 5 years of not touching the money and letting the dividends pay it off, and I’m not even accounting for borrowing costs and taxation here), so the best way out I can think of is to just sell off the securities, shut down the margin account and cash out the entirety of the portfolio, to then reinvest it at more comfortable rates, whatever those may be. At the same 18.15%, and again, assuming no portfolio growth at all, we’d be looking at 241 361 of gross passive income, without any associated loan anymore.

And that’s it, that’s all I can think of, I might edit the post as I think or read some answers to save everyone time. What am I missing here? Any reason NOT to do this?



TL;DR: If one invests in a margin-trading account, and high yield securities (15% and up), those dividend distributions compound extremely fast since every new cash injection in the account adds 3.33x the amount in buying power. One can go from any modest initial seed money and very rapidly multiply their portfolio size, and passive income if that’s what you’re after. I think my math and my spreadsheet are clean, but I feel like it’s too good to be true, and I’d like someone to help me stress test the theory or point out whichever flaw I may have missed.

Kattie: Yeah, it means you're a gambler - and CEOs are really great at pumping hype and making themselves money. Look, successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Take your beloved Apple, Nvidia, or Google and look at their history. In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey. In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with its products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. In 2010 it still wasn't too late to buy Apple stock, right? In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was too late? Ha!

Jonny: I don't get your point.

Kattie: Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products, all because management is big on words, selling a ""we're the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action, in product. With a great business, you don't need a middleman selling you a story; you can witness the impact yourself. A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research; take your time. Even after five years, we'll still offer a great opportunity."" They are not loud, because they have a moat! A scam business sells you a beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist. Do you really think those companies you invested in are the next Nvidia, Google, and Apple? Have they demonstrated excellence multiple times over the previous years? Did they really changing the world? Do you see it yourself?

Jonny: Well, I guess we need to wait and see if they'll really create a product that will change our lives. Now I see why you brought up Google in 2005 - it was already impacting everyone's life, but it wasn't a missed opportunity. It was just the beginning.

Kattie: Exactly! Great companies continue to be great and reinvest their talent into developing more great stuff.

Jonny: What should I do with my portfolio? Sell it? Buy Nvidia and Google?

Kattie: I won't tell what you should do. If I were in this situation, I'd first consider myself very lucky. I made good money on a blind gamble. Thanks, life! Then I'd be smarter with my investments. I'd take my gambling profit and reinvest it into an index fund by dividing it into 24 equal chunks and buying one chunk every month. That would benefit me if the stock market crashes because of all the insane gambling hype happening right now. I'd use those two years to learn financial analysis and how to interpret companies balance sheets. That would give me the tools to invest in the market.

Jonny: But 5x, I really afraid that I might miss the next round.

Kattie: Remember, 99% of start-ups fail, even if at some point their stock price rises 10x in a short period of time. That means you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Short-term gains != long-term success. In a gamble, it's better to take a profit and leave the table. 

Jonny: I guess you're right. I'll ask what folks on Reddit think about this situation.

1ntlfop,investing,Micron (MU) has lots of room to grow,"Micron Technology is a global leader in memory and storage solutions, a foundational part of nearly all modern electronics. Over the past six months, Micron’s share price has surged by nearly 70 percent, and its year-to-date gain now stands at over 92 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations.

Behind this rally lies Micron’s growing strategic importance in the AI and data center economy.
Its memory chips are increasingly essential for powering artificial intelligence applications, with top-tier customers like NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Lenovo relying on Micron’s cutting-edge technology.

Top analysts from Citi, TDCowen, and Deutsche Bank remain bullish ahead of upcoming earnings, pointing to tailwinds from the expanding data center market, which is forecasted to grow by 33 percent annually through 2030. In Q4 2025 alone, analysts expect a staggering 109 percent year-over-year revenue increase.

With industry momentum, strong financials, and unmatched exposure to AI demand, Micron is shaping up to be one of the strongest long-term semiconductor bets of 2025.

Despite Micron’s impressive 2025 rally, many investors believe it still trades at a discount to its true value. The key reason is Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains significantly lower than peers. Its 2026 forward P/E of just 9.72x is well below the semiconductor industry average.

This disconnect exists because much of Micron’s value lies in its exposure to high-bandwidth memory, a crucial technology for powering AI workloads. Micron’s HBM product lines are sold out through 2026 and the next-generation HBM4 chips are already generating buzz.

Micron is evolving from a cyclical chipmaker into a long-term growth story. With AI infrastructure booming, its undervaluation won’t last much longer.

Wall Street is focused on Micron ahead of its next earnings release. In recent weeks, Citi,
Mizuho, and Susquehanna all raised their price targets, with Citi and Susquehanna now
targeting $200 and Mizuho not far behind at $182.

Citi also reiterated its Buy rating, citing stronger-than-expected demand for AI-ready memory chips. Micron’s earnings per share expectations have risen accordingly, with investors anticipating continued upside surprises.

Micron already delivered an EPS of $3.03 in Q4 2025, significantly beating estimates, and
analysts expect the trend to continue. Key themes to watch in the upcoming report include AI product demand, margin guidance, and capacity updates for 2026.

The AI revolution is triggering a record wave of infrastructure investment. From Microsoft’s $30 billion supercomputer project in the UK to Nvidia’s backing of OpenAI with up to $100 billion in funding, the scale of global AI investment is massive.

Micron sits at the heart of this growth, supplying high-bandwidth DRAM and NAND memory required to keep AI models running. With OpenAI’s Stargate project planning
multi-gigawatt-scale data centers, Micron’s role as a memory provider is becoming even more critical.

Micron has even reorganized internally to reflect this shift, aligning its product roadmap to the growing demands of the AI and cloud markets.

Micron’s financial foundation is solid. The company continues to ramp up R&D investment, especially in AI-focused memory, while improving profitability. Recent quarters show operating margin expansion, and Micron’s R&D budget now exceeds historical averages, reflecting its strategy to stay ahead in HBM, DRAM, and NAND technology.

This combination of profitability improvements and innovation spending makes Micron uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future AI cycles.

Micron has built a strong track record of earnings performance, consistently delivering beats on EPS and revenue.

In Q4 2025, Micron reported an EPS of $3.03 compared to estimates ranging from $2.53 to
$2.86. Revenue was $11.3 billion, also above expectations. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double beats in fiscal 2025.

Micron has now beaten expectations for eight straight quarters. This consistency reflects both demand strength and operational execution and has been a key driver of investor confidence.

Micron remains attractively valued even after its run-up. Its forward P/E is 13.4x, well below the sector median of 19.2x. Its forward price-to-sales ratio near 3.7x is also lower than that of leading AI peers like Nvidia and AMD.
This valuation gap is notable, especially given Micron’s exposure to the same AI megatrends as its higher-multiple competitors. Even a re-rating to average sector multiples would imply a substantial upside, with some analysts suggesting prices well above $200 per share.
While the bullish case for Micron is strong, risks remain. 

Competition from Samsung and SK
Hynix is intensifying, particularly in high-bandwidth memory. The memory market itself is highly cyclical and could be affected by any slowdown in AI or cloud infrastructure spending.

There has also been regular insider selling and approximately $200 million in quarterly
stock-based compensation. Although much of this is standard practice in tech and not tied to
bearish sentiment, it still contributes to dilution. In addition, any missteps in yield, supply chains, or global trade could pressure margins.
Micron holds approximately $11.9 billion in cash and $14 billion in debt, resulting in low net
leverage. Its investment-grade profile gives it the flexibility to raise capital at favorable terms if needed. This reduces reliance on equity and helps limit shareholder dilution.

This financial strength provides a buffer against the memory industry’s inherent volatility and
supports Micron’s long-term strategy.
Looking further ahead, Micron’s FY2027 forward P/E projection is just 10.5x. This sets up an attractive long-term buying opportunity, particularly as AI spending is expected to grow
throughout the decade.

Micron is well positioned to benefit across multiple AI investment cycles, not just a short-term surge.

From a technical perspective, Micron’s RSI currently signals overbought conditions, suggesting the stock may cool off in the near term. However, its price remains well above the long-term simple moving average, confirming a strong bullish trend.

Crucially, the fundamentals support the technical momentum. Robust demand, earnings strength, and favorable industry trends provide a solid foundation, suggesting that any pullbacks may represent long-term buying opportunities.

Governments worldwide are investing heavily in AI infrastructure. The United States has
supported projects in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Norway, while other nations like the UK, UAE,
and Japan are also building next-gen AI facilities.

As a key supplier of high-performance memory, Micron stands to benefit from this global infrastructure buildout. Its products are necessary components in nearly every advanced AI deployment on the horizon.
Micron insiders, including CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, regularly sell shares through pre-scheduled trading plans. While the lack of insider buying may be seen as a mild negative, it is typical in the tech industry where executives are already highly exposed to company stock.

Micron also issues about $200 million in stock-based compensation each quarter. While this
contributes to modest dilution, it is not excessive compared to other major tech firms and is an accepted tool for attracting and retaining top talent.

Given Micron’s growing earnings and market position, this dilution is manageable and does not materially weaken the bullish case.

Micron offers a rare combination of explosive earnings growth, AI-driven product demand,
attractive valuation, and a strong balance sheet. While competition and market cycles require ongoing attention, the upside potential significantly outweighs the risks.

As Micron continues to execute and deliver results, it remains a strong buy ahead of earnings and into 2026.

Investor sentiment has been overwhelmingly positive. Retail traders view Micron as one of the leading beneficiaries of the AI boom, and institutional investors are showing strong conviction.

Hedge funds have increased their stakes and long-term investors like pension funds are holding steady.

With confidence from both Wall Street and Main Street, Micron is becoming one of the most widely embraced infrastructure plays in the AI space.

The semiconductor industry is undergoing a transformation powered by AI and data. Micron
Technology sits at the center of this shift. As covered throughout this report, Micron’s rising
earnings, leadership in next-gen memory, and robust financial position give it a powerful
long-term edge.

The company is positioning itself for the future of technology, from generative AI to cloud
computing and beyond. Even after a substantial run-up in 2025, Micron remains attractively valued with room to grow.

All signs point to Micron Technology being a top semiconductor pick for 2025 and the years
ahead.",1,7,2025-09-29 15:41:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntlfop/micron_mu_has_lots_of_room_to_grow/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513446
1ntk8nk,investing,Bankrupt/Closed businesses question?,"EDIT: Answer provided almost immediately- thanks! 

I've tried searching for the answer and am not finding it, so I'm hoping someone knows: 

When you invest in an index fund, what happens if one of the company disappears? 
(Eg it goes bankrupt or it closes) 
Especially if it is a higher percentage of the index fund? 

Does it differ if it's a mutual fund vs ETFs? 

Are the companies that compromise the index fund set in stone? 
Do you lose that percentage of your investment, or does it get reallocated into the other companies already in the index fund and the percentages for all get adjusted? 
Does the whole index fund get shut down, and money refunded or lost? 

Or does the manager/s of the index fund, find a different company to sub in for the company that no longer exists? 
Does this still happen if it's a passive fund? 
(Are they already swapping companies in and out if some are performing badly? I haven't been watching the complete makeup of funds I've already invested in to notice if they changed since I bought shares) 

I understand/assume there'd be a huge value loss immediately if this happened eap with large companies, so I'm not asking about the value per se, but what then happens with the fund? 



(I realised a lot of the index funds have the same couple of major companies making up a solid chunk of their allocation. I realise the likelihood of eg Amazon suddenly shutting down is incredibly minimal, and I do realise there are likely legal protections in place to prevent this occurring, but it made me very curious with ""but what if?!!"". When I've tried to search for the answer, the search engines keep only giving me information for if the broker/fund management company closes- which is NOT what I'm curious about)",4,4,2025-09-29 14:57:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ntk8nk/bankruptclosed_businesses_question/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513449

Neodymium is the leading option but Iron-Nitride is expected to surpass this when production increases in the long term.

1nse5u1,investing,"Using MGK, SCHD, and SCHY to create a value and quality tilted VT like portfolio","Hey everybody :)

I've been doing a lot of investment self education lately (mostly with google and chatGPT) and I kind of wanted to ""come up for air"" so to speak and run an idea I have by actual people.

I'll give the idea first and then try to explain some of the reasoning behind it and then detail a quick back of the napkin analysis of its performance. I'm trying to elicit discussion!

**Portfolio Construction Rules**

To start, we allocate a portion of MGK to the portfolio such that the weighting of the largest holding of MGK in our portfolio would be similar to the weighting of that position in VT.

Right now, the largest holding of MGK is NVDA at 14.02%. NVDA's percentage in VT is 4.11%, so that would suggest an allocation of 4.11/14.02 or \~29.32% to MGK.

Then we look at the US and international split of VT. Right now that's 36.6%, so we allocate 36.6% percent of our portfolio to SCHY.

Then the rest is SCHD or in this case 100-29.32-36.6=34.08% to SCHD.

**So right now we'd be 29.32% MGK, 36.6% SCHY, and 34.08% SCHD**

Then annually, we rebalance using this same procedure.

**Reasoning**

I think the long term historical record is clear on what tends to happen in equity returns.

Fundamental growth (i.e. sales growth, to a lesser extent earnings growth) tends to mean revert over time, usually within 10 years or so of a high growth period for a given firm.

Profitability (i.e. ROIC or similar) tends to persist for much longer but also mean reverts in the long run (20+ years timeframe).

Thus, what tends to happen is that a firm posts great growth results, gets bid up as investors forecast that growth into perpetuity, fails to live up to the forecasts, gets poor returns... and vice versa, poor growth tends to get forecasted into perpetuity and tends to rebound for underperforming firms...

This leads to the value premium.

However, just looking for lagging firms isn't a great idea because very often lagging firms are lagging for a reason, and that reason is that the business is dying (the ""value trap"" issue). One way to account for this and separate the ""temporarily setback"" from the ""dying"" companies is to use quality metrics, like ROIC, to identify the businesses that are still fundamentally doing ok even though their purchase multiples may be depressed.

Buying a basket of firms like this has, historically, been a good way to get good returns.

However, I think we all know what's coming next... this premium hasn't really manifested in global markets over the last 10-15 years, and instead we've seen the rise of massive, highly profitable firms where the growth doesn't seem to mean revert, and those firms have come to dominate our global indices.

We all know the names... NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL... the dominant mega cap tech and tech adjacent firms that we know and love.

Given this reality I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions... Is this performance a ""bubble"" in the sense of being an overvaluation of these companies, or is this an indication of fundamental changes in the structure of markets that are likely to persist over time...

Frankly... I don't know, but here are some thoughts.

The argument in favor of this being a structural shift in markets is fairly strong in my opinion.

For one thing, the data that suggests that above described qualities of equities relies on data collected from time periods in which the types of companies that dominated our markets were very different that these types of companies. They tend to have much less need for capital investment to expand their operations and so can scale at a level faster and at higher rates of returns than companies in other industries. They have sources of reliable reoccurring revenue without necessarily needing to make new products or make new investments (i.e. software subscription services). They have network effects that are MASSIVE and usually reasonably high switching costs that make their customers sticky, and that's not even to get into the current big thing which is, of course, AI and where that could take us in terms of long term innovation.

I've always liked the thought experiment that it makes no sense for a firm to grow at higher than average rates for a long period of time, because if they did, then their own growth would make up a larger and larger portion of overall growth that the actual underlying growth rate might converge upon their own growth rate (i.e. they're so BIG they're bringing UP the average on their own).

It's seemed like a ridiculous proposition to me, but I've seen some data showing that spending on data centers (largely for AI) in the US has eclipsed ALL consumer spending at this point, and I've also seen data suggesting that the top 10% of all household contribute to approximately HALF of consumer spending

In addition to those numbers are the weights in the indexes themselves. NVDA, one company, is literally more than 4% of the entire world publicly traded stock market... And the top 10 make up \~20%... In US markets it's even more crazy where NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, AVGO, GOOGL, and TSLA make up more than a third of the S&P 500

It's ridiculously top heavy, and historically, that might make you think ""it's a bubble"" but these aren't ridiculously bid up speculative firms with no earnings. They have high PEs for sure, but they're ridiculously profitable firms with good growth headwinds for the next decade.

The market is fundamentally VERY different from the days of industrial, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and financial firm dominance that (critically to our discussion) marked the time periods in which the research that suggests a value premium exists were based on. It's possible the markets have fundamentally changed.

So...

What do you do about all of that?

Well for one thing, ""This time, it's different"" is a dangerous phrase in finance, and all of that ""structural change"" stuff I've just said might very well be exemplifying that phrase. Maybe, for example, there is a qualitative shift in AI design needed to reach AGI (whatever that means) level of intelligence that current LLM based models just can't solve and it's NOT just a scaling problem with data center size and computing power such that the current AI craze slows down over time (the disappointment of ChatGPT 5 is an indication this might be true) That's fairly reasonable imo, if this case is true then you just keep plugging at the value and quality premium and ignore the idea of big tech leading to a structural market change that invalidates it, and that strategy actually performs reasonably well, even in an environment of big tech dominance.

As an example, SCHD (which is a dividend focused ETF but does a good job at capturing firms with good quality factors and good valuations imo) returned about 12.3% over the past decade, which is less than the S&P 500's 14.5% return over the same time period and much less than MGK's 17.97% returns over the same time period, but relative to historical norms of \~10% per year returns in US equities it's still very good, and it did it with very little exposure to the tech giants that have dominated US equities over that time period AND without seeing the same kind of multiple expansion that has happened in US markets over that time period.

If you use the strategy I suggested for the portfolio as a whole but only the US slice, then you'd have a portfolio that's about 54% SCHD and 46% MGK, and that portfolio would have returned \~14.9% over the last decade whereas VTI only returned 13.9%, suggesting the premium is still ""working"" in the portion of the market that is NOT ""big growth.""

Similarly, SCHY (or the index that underlies it as SCHY itself is only a few years old), which follows similar portfolio construction rules to SCHD but for international markets, got returns of 9.92% over the last decade whereas VXUS got only 7.54%.

To me, this result suggests that maybe the idea of value and quality still ""works"" in the market, it just works in a different segment than these big tech players, and it's possible that at some point in the future, maybe soon, maybe far, that it reasserts itself largely enough to lead to a long term time period of outperformance as these big firms do actually finally face headwinds that materially hamper long term returns.

Another approach is to give up on active investing in general and just buy an index.

Again, this is very reasonable. It's probably what most people (including possibly me!) ""should"" do.

However, I will assert that while it's VERY difficult to pick ""winners"" it's not as hard to pick losers, and if you just index, you do make sure you get the winners, but you also systemically buy... well, not so good companies... 

I think a third option is the portfolio construction I detailed above.

**The idea behind it** is that you're betting, in a globally proportionate way, on the value + quality premium showing up in the market in the long run while also hedging the idea that the current mega cap growth stock dominance is a true long term (like lifetime defining...) shift in the structure of markets such that they will continue their dominance and you weight them specifically in your portfolio in a similar way to how they would have been weighted in an indexing approach.

**Performance Analysis**

Ok, here's where I go over some numbers. I've already said a few of them in my discussion, but if I look at how that portfolio that I detailed at the top has performed, here's what it looks like:

MGK 17.97% 10 year return 29.32% of the portfolio

SCHD 12.3% 10 year return 34.08% of the portfolio

SCHY 9.92% 10 year return (using the underlying index as a proxy) 36.6% of the portfolio

**Total portfolio return:** 17.97\*0.2932+12.3\*0.3408+9.92\*0.366 = **13.08% CAGR**

**VT Return: 11.16% CAGR**

Now, this simplistic analysis has a few problems:

We'll start with taxes. One of the biggest advantages to simple indexing strategies is how tax efficient they are. Even if you can find a strategy that outperforms them, doing so AFTER accounting for the tax drags associated with trading is VERY difficult.  This strategy is fairly tax efficient but less so than simply buying VT.

Let's try to calculate a tax drag on each strategy.

For VT, you're never selling... so you don't get hit with capital gains taxes, but you do get hit with dividend taxes. Let's assume you're paying the top US qualified dividend tax rate on your dividends, which is 20% and the yield on VT is \~1.72% so you get a tax drag of \~0.344% and... that's it...

**Total VT return after taxes: 10.81 CAGR**

For my proposed portfolio it's a little more complicated... First off, there are way more dividends. Though I used them as proxies for a value + quality tilt, SCHD and SCHY are fundamentally dividend funds.

Right now SCHD pays a 3.8% yield and SCHY pays a 3.71% yield. MGT also pays a 0.4% dividends (yes, dividends on growth stocks!) Given their weights that's a total dividend yield of 0.4\*0.2932+3.8\*0.3408+3.71\*0.366 = \~2.78%

Assuming the same tax rate and you get a tax drag for the dividend portion of \~0.56%

Then for the rebalancing part. It's going to accumulate a tax drag, but it's hard to estimate how much. When I think through the logic of the rebalance, if the premise is true that the top growth will keep dominating BUT the REST of the market still sees a value premium (and in the last decade, it seems to have been a bit larger in the international markets) then we're likely consistently moving money toward MGT and out of SCHD and SCHY and we know that the price return portion of our total return was roughly 10.3% per year, if we assume the top long term capital gains tax rate on ALL of that it would be a 2% drag per year (20% rate) but since most of our portfolio is NOT being rebalanced, it would likely be far smaller.

This is much harder to guestimate without doing a more detailed backtest, I posed the question to ChatGPT and it suggested a \~0.3% drag, which would indicate moving around \~15% of the portfolio each year. That seems reasonable, but I'll go ahead and assume a higher one of 0.5% per year to be safe.

That leaves us with a **total portfolio return after taxes of 12.02% CAGR**

That's some significant outperformance!

Obviously there are a few issues here. Firstly past performance does not predict future performance. Secondly, this ""back of the napkin"" method ignores a lot of things. For one thing, I started with the current split of MGK to SCHD to SCHY which is likely NOT what it would have been if I'd followed the same rules 10 years ago. Would the shifts over the last decade have made the returns higher or lower? Idk. Thirdly, I used current dividend yields to estimate tax drag instead of actual historical ones. Is the yield of this portfolio similar throughout time? Also, idk, a rising allocation toward the megacaps that tend to pay less in dividends might suggest that past years would have had more dividends. Also, SCHY has been on a tear this year (impact of tariff concerns in the US I think) so it's dividend is MUCH lower than it has been for most of the last decade. Similarly SCHD's is higher (and for similar reasons, again showing this structural divide, the tariff concerns are impacting NON mega cap growth US firms, but the mega cap growth is enough to still bring up the index...)

Of course, another piece is that I haven't analyzed volatility or drawdowns. As someone who is mostly long term and fundamentals driven, I tend to care about this less than average, but it would be important to analyze before drawing conclusions. I suspect it would perform reasonably well. MGK is high volatility but again we're just holding in proportion to its weighting in the index and SCHD and SCHY both tend to have low volatility holdings.

There would need to be more extensive back testing done to figure out if there is any value to this strategy...

But... I think the reasoning behind it is sound (capture value + quality premium in a globally diversified way while hedging mega cap growth dominance) and initial ""back of the napkin"" math looks promising

1nsa2sl,investing,You can't beat the market by buying good companies for the same reason you can’t get rich betting on the best football teams,"The idea that information is “priced in” is a notoriously tricky concept for new investors (I know I struggled with it for a while), and it occurred to me that a sports betting analogy might help.

You can go out and bet on who is going to win tomorrow's NFL games, but for most of those games, there's a lot of information out there that leads people to expect that one team is more likely to win. Take, for example, tomorrow's Bills-Saints game. There's a lot of information suggesting that the Bills are a much better team, and are much more likely than the Saints to win. As a result, if you want to bet that the Bills will win, you're not going to find someone who will take the other side of that bet straight up.

To get someone to take the other side of the bet, you have to concede something: either give them better odds (ie they get a bigger payout if their unlikely bet pays off), or a spread, meaning a number of points that the favored team must win by for the bet to pay out (in this example, the Bills have to win by at least 15 tomorrow, if they win by 7, the people who bet on the Saints get the money). The expectation that the Bills are going to win is priced in, the odds or spread adjust until equal numbers of people are willing to take either side of the bet.

The stock market works the same way. There's a lot of information that leads people to expect that Apple will continue to grow and perform much better than the average company. As a result, to get someone to agree to sell you an Apple share, you have to pay a high price: 35 times Apple's current earnings per share (compared to an average of about 26.6 times for the US stock market as a whole). If everyone expects Apple to do better as a company than the market in general, the price of the stock will rise until there's an equal number of buyers and sellers. The expectation that Apple will have above average earnings in the future is already priced in, just like the expectation that the Bills will beat the Saints.

Everyone agrees the Bills will probably beat the Saints. To bet on it, you need to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. Everyone agrees Apple will probably have better earnings than the average company. To bet on it (ie buying Apple shares instead of a total market index fund), you have to have an *even higher conviction* than the consensus. You can't get rich betting on teams that everyone knows are good, and you can't beat the market buying companies that everyone knows are good. Available information is priced in.

Edit: I stopped watching football a while back, so the fact that the Bills are -14.5 vs the Saints is wild to me.

Edit2: If you think you have a method for finding mispriced stocks, that’s not necessarily in conflict with my point here. The point is that it’s more complicated than simply buying companies widely regarded as good, in contrast to what new investors often assume. (That said I do tend to be skeptical that retail investors can expect to find a market-beating strategy)

Edit 3: the Bills won 31-19, meaning that they won the game but did not cover the spread, and people who put money on the Saints won.",156,130,2025-09-27 23:57:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nsa2sl/you_cant_beat_the_market_by_buying_good_companies/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513644

1nrz2zr,investing,How much should i worry about currency risk?,"Hiya,  
I've recently started earning in ILS (previously GBP) - i had been investing in Vanguard's lifestrategy 80% through vanguard (which took GBP - although maybe the core etf was in something else), but in losing by British residency, I have also lost the ability to continue investing through that route.

I'm interested in still investing in vanguard's 80% life strategy as I feel comfortable with it, and have had very good returns, but now through IBRK. The only option I can find is 'VNGA80', or 'VNGD80', both of which are in EUR. this is my first time investing in my non living currency - and was wondering how much of a risk this is (especially ILS and EUR)?

For some reason i'd feel a bit safer being invested in USD, although I don't have a factual basis for this other than 'gut feeling'. Considering this, I was also thinking about investing 80% in 'VT' (or 'VWRL' once I fully understand the difference), which is in USD, and then finding a suitable bond market ETF to invest the remaining 20% in, in essence, making my own version of VNGA80 that I can adjust the bond / equity ratios along with my risk appetite.

1nrrne6,investing,Is Google still cheap? 10 year expected returns,"Google went from “Search is dead” to “Google might be the most valuable company because of AI,” fueling a 70% rally in just half a year. Congrats to those who realized that search wasn’t dead and captured those fast gains. To me, this wasn’t a difficult call, quarter after quarter, it was clear that search was performing better and better.

However, is GOOGL still a bargain after a 70% rally? Lets look into it.

When I evaluate whether a stock is a bargain, I typically use discounted models for Free Cash Flow (FCF), Earnings Per Share (EPS), and revenue. I base these models on conservative growth rates and terminal valuations, which give me both an expected-case and worst-case fair value.  
After making the model, I can adjust the expected CAGR return, to determine the expected returns to justify the current market cap. So I will provide what we can expect Google stock will return every year (on average) the next 10 years.

From there, I look for at least a 12.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next 10 years. That may sound aggressive, but it builds in a margin of safety while ensuring my returns are likely to outperform the S&P 500.

Once the model is built, I adjust the expected CAGR to see what kind of return the current market cap implies together with the expected growth rates and terminal valuations.

Anyways here are the results:

FCF: 6% to 7.5% CAGR  
EPS: 11.5% to 14.5% CAGR  
Revenue: 5% to 7% CAGR

So is GOOGL a bargain at today's price?  
Probably not.

Expecting annual returns of around 7%, or as low as 5% under worse assumptions, is not particularly exciting. Note that EPS return estimates are likely inflated due to share buy backs.

That said, this is not a case for selling. GOOGL remains my largest position. Google is one of the greatest businesses in the world, and apart from Saudi Aramco (big oil), it is the highest-earning company globally, while Google's margins and growth are outstanding.

Holding onto world-class businesses, even when they are trading at okay rather than great prices, is perfectly fine. But I will not be adding to my position at current levels.

For me this is a clear hold.",259,134,2025-09-27 10:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nrrne6/is_google_still_cheap_10_year_expected_returns/,2025-09-30 15:06:05.513690

1nrohh5,investing,Study shows wealthy investors react more strongly to financial stress (but recover confidence faster),"India does a national household survey consisting of 275,000+ responses. A research analyzing these responses found that higher income groups become significantly more pessimistic about current economic conditions during financial market stress, compared to lower income households. However, wealthy households show no increased pessimism about future economic prospects.

This likely reflects greater exposure to financial markets among wealthy households, they feel immediate stress from market volatility but have confidence in their long term financial resilience. I found this bit surprising as I thought people with lesser wealth would be more concerned about it being eroded away than the wealthy folks. 

The study also revealed that currency fluctuations and government debt spreads impact household confidence more than stock market volatility in India, which is the opposite pattern from developed economies where banking sector stress dominates.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the entire retirement ""industry"" is geared towards this, and not towards living off of dividends. My free advisor at Fidelity is definitely not oriented towards dividend investing, either now, or in retirement.

I feel like there's some information that I'm missing that only applies to dividend investing. Maybe things like switches in your investments to make now to reduce risk, maximizing dividend income safety, how to make sure your portfolio keeps ahead of inflation. I'm pretty sure that there's plenty of other topics that I'm missing.

Are there any good resources about **LIVING OFF OF DIVIDENDS IN RETIREMENT**? For example, Armchair Income is great - for investing for dividends. I am a devoted follower, watch him every week, always take his advice with a healthy grain of salt, and do my own research. And yeah, I get that he's retired, but he's really all about the investing part of things, not about ""well, here's what you gotta know as you make the transition into retirement"", or ""here's what you gotta know about actually living off of your dividends in retirement"".

It was priced monthly, so presumably marketable. It had a 10-12% yield, which was fairly typical for bond funds at the time. But the income was never reported on her her tax forms; however, it did show up as a ""RECIP DIST"" on the 1099s with a note, ""Your distributions have been adjusted to reflect proper tax reportability."" She had her taxes prepared by a CPA so presumably he knew what he was doing.

The NAV of the fund steadily declined over the 7 years she held it. I don't think the dividend was 100% return of capital. (What would be the point anyway of buying a fund that paid back mostly return of capital, unless it was some kind of tax oddity?)

1nr9opa,investing,I bungled up good and proper,"God I'm regarded.

I lost 80% of my portfolio due to too many call contracts (on another stock that was performing well). I turned $700CAD to $2600USD like a week ago (yes, I'm a poor). I've never earned that much money investing before, and I knew right then there I should just pull half out to lock in the gains, or wait a bit and go back in at an optimal when it has a reasonable dip. Or maybe look at some other stocks.

But no, instead stock started falling further, activated stop limits, price went down, caused more people to sell, activated more limit stops, etc. The stock had been lingering around 9.50 - 10.50 for almost a week - after that huge drop it went down to $7. What's worse is I had a reasonable number of puts (bought too high) and I wanted to get rid of them. Eventually it broke even and I sold it, thinking it would surge back up at any minute.

I was also buying additional calls because their price was so slow, I was sure that there would be at least a mild rally and I'd be able to get maybe 50 - 60% of my money back.

Eventually today it went up to 8.06, and I only had 2 days before expiring. I didn't want to risk holding onto it much longer only for it to fall more. So I sold it and lost $1200USD.

You know what the best part is? It raised 25% immediately the next day after I sold and I would earned over double if I just waited 12 more hours. It went up to like $9.10, and my breakeven was 9.12

Not looking for financial advice, admittedly I've only been in and out of investing for a few years on WealthSimple.

1nr97zy,investing,Prophecy-Based Trading Strategy,"It is really simple.

This is about the “Prophet Trading Method,” a true golden tip.

There is a very famous prophet named Baba Vanga, known for an accuracy rate of about 85 percent.

If you read her prophecies carefully, you can see the future direction of humanity.

That is where you begin your reasoning.

Of course, not every prophecy comes true, but the important part is the overall direction they suggest.

You can view prophecy as an indicator of humanity’s general course.

So if you take long positions in sectors that align with that direction, even if you face temporary losses, some stocks will naturally rise over time.

For example, if you study the prophecies closely, you will find hints about breakthroughs in human biotechnology, solar energy, renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, and so on.

On the other hand, investing in directions not mentioned in the prophecies, such as oil or coal, could be considered a foolish choice.

The idea is simple. Take the results inferred from the prophecies, select the sectors that match, buy the ones that are undervalued, wait, and then sell when the time is right.

I personally invested heavily in Lithium Americas for its role in clean energy and waited a long time.

Recently, I was fortunate that Lithium Americas surged, and I made a good profit.

You can also find Baba Vanga’s prophecies on Wikipedia for reference.

If you are not sure, focus on renewable energy, AI, quantum computing, or biotechnology.

If you wait a few years, the chances are high that you will not lose money.",0,6,2025-09-26 18:36:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nr97zy/prophecybased_trading_strategy/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.460850

Part of the learning curve is recognizing the fact that a share price can decrease, without ANY fundamental change in the company. The company can absolutely obliterate all expectations, and the ""share price"" can still drop. 
My point is, I sold many lots early because I was new, and impatient. 
I've learned two things. 1- DCA all day. 2- if you believe in the companies fundamentals and nothing has changed, then do not react to outside influence. Do not sell, continue to DCA all day. 
Off the top of my head, I sold: RIG at 0.64, MP at 18, IONQ at 9, ZDGE at 2.4, WD at 43, INTC at 26, RGTI at 8, NOTE at 2, CARR at 55, GME at 13 (PRIOR TO THE SHORT), NIO at 4, ON at 30, RR at 1.40,  ERIC at 3.3, XOM at 60, GE at 130 (13 pre split), UPST at 19, MU at 50, TTD - i sold at 561, but its been RSd and I dont know today's equivalent. 

 All of those above are higher today, than my sell price. Also, when I sold, at whatever time, with the exception of WD and CARR (they where green, but nothing crazy) they where in the red, for sure. The moral of the story was, nothing changed. I sold due to a reaction of the market, NOT, the company. 
Here's the kicker. I'm still up 300% overall  and 1000%+ percent lots, because I learned my lesson. I identified my error, ( I used to panic )
I swallowed that lesson. Took it in stride, and made the change. I stuck with PLTR ( at its worse, down 90+ percent) , RKLB (worst , down 88+) , PL (down 60%). And have been DCA all day, and don't watch the day-to-day. The companies are execution, nothing has changed fundamentally, and the outcome has been nothing but amazing. The result? Today , I'm in the green 300%+ overall. Why? I identified my errors, and key point. ACCEPTED IT AS TRUE. Make the change. And win.

1nqrymi,investing,"Is my explanation of how bonds work, correct?","Thank you very much for your help. Very much appreciated!



**How do bonds work?**  
Put as simply as I could:

1. Government/firm issues a bond with a coupon rate (interest rate) similar to the market interest rate.
2. **Primary market:** according to RBA (*2022),* when an investor has purchased the bond **for the first time,** this is called buying in the **primary** **market**. *(This first price of bond depends on interest rate, term of bond, and price of similar bonds).*
3. **In the primary market, the buyer pays the face (nominal) value of the bond, and the yield (aka return) matches the bonds coupon rate.** The buyer will want the coupon rate/yield to be higher than market interest rates.
4. But if later on the bondholder decides to sell the bond before maturity, (due to many factors) it will be sold on the '“**secondary market.”**
5. **In the secondary market -** bond market price fluctuates on top of the face value because of supply and demand. There are many factors affecting bond like competing market interest rates (shown below) and the yield of the bond. Makes sense, right? When market prices exceed the face value of a bond, you are paying at a premium. When market prices are below face value of a bond, you are paying at a discount
6. Bondholders will need to recalculate the yield, as the coupon rate no longer matches the yield (because market prices have changed). This is done using this simple formula: coupon / market price x 100 **The relationship between the market price and bond yield is inverse.** *(EconplusDal, 2017)*",9,9,2025-09-26 04:24:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqrymi/is_my_explanation_of_how_bonds_work_correct/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.460966
1nqrx0d,investing,Mid term gains to beat ETFs?,"I’ve just started investing and could use some advice on how to allocate my money. Right now I’m aiming for about a 70/30 split between individual stocks and an ETF. I’ve already funded the ETF side, but for the stock portion I’m trying to narrow down my picks.

My goal is to grow this portfolio at 15–20% annually (minimum) to outperform the ETF, then roll the gains back into ETFs later. I understand the risks and taxes involved, and I don’t mind some volatility since I’m still learning.

The main stocks I’m considering are:
	•	AMD – strong potential if they land new deals and improve their software side.
	•	UNH – looks undervalued; the investigation doesn’t seem too damaging, and the stock hasn’t fully corrected since the murder news.
	•	SHOP.TO – e-commerce is still growing, and last quarter’s earnings beat gave it a strong rebound.

I’m also keeping an eye on GOOGL and researching NVO.

I suspect a larger market correction is coming eventually, but I still think there’s time to benefit from the current bullish trend.

For example, if inflation is 3–4% (and lately it feels higher), then $10,000 in a savings account is worth less every single year. Even with interest, most savings accounts barely keep up, unless you’re in a HYSA and even then, it’s still behind inflation in many cases.

So in 2025, is “saving” just outdated advice? Wouldnt it make more sense to always be investing instead of sitting on cash?

1nqlo50,investing,"SPT Sprout Social - No one talks about it, and i dont know why","Here’s everything you need to know about SPT - Sprout Social. If you still believe the company is not undervalued after reading this, I can’t help you.

1. In the era of AI, data plays a crucial role. Sprout Social connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this amount of data.

2. Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

3. Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.


Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:

- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG: Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.


Risks:
- „But there is an investigation“. That’s for wrongdoing. I think there were 200 cases like this last year. Let’s say they have to pay $25 million - $23 million will be paid by D&O, and Sprout will pay $2 million. Thats nothing.

- „I make more profit than they do“. Value doesn’t necessarily equate to profit. Over the past three years, they’ve acquired three companies. The product has received new features and a significant amount of AI integration. Growth is more crucial than profit, as profit will naturally follow. Sprinklr became profitable too early, resulting in revenue growth of about 6%, but the company is currently struggling. Sprout, on the other hand, has experienced double-digit revenue growth and is poised for even greater success as it shifts towards serving upmarket and larger customers, like Honda and NASCAR. Trust me, profits will follow.

- „High SBC“. Yes, this is true, and I don’t like it either. As far as I know, in 2023, they offered their employees SBC. However, at least SBC didn’t increase last year and instead remained flat. Nevertheless, SBC is high, and I don’t like it either. Without it, they would already be profitable. What’s important to me is that they are operational profitable, even though they are not GAAP-based. GAAP-based profit will follow.",0,15,2025-09-25 23:14:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqlo50/spt_sprout_social_no_one_talks_about_it_and_i/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461050

1nqfbgz,investing,Why do we insist on CRP when there is none?,"Let me use Turkey as an example.

There’s this idea that investors should require an extra risk premium when they invest outside the US. Sure, we can debate the whole “US exceptionalism” thing, but leaving that aside…

According to CAPM, you shouldn’t get compensated for risks you can diversify away. For instance, most European markets are pretty tightly correlated with the global market. So, no matter how much you diversify, you’re still basically exposed to the same risks.

Turkey, though, is different. Since the 2018 shift to the presidential system, its correlation with the MSCI World Index has been just 0.36, with an R² of 0.13. That’s really low. It basically means Turkey doesn’t move with world markets, so if you diversify, you can actually wash out most of its country-specific risks.

So my question is: why do we still tack on an extra risk premium for Turkey?

And here’s a bonus thought: Turkey’s equity risk premium has been close to zero, or even negative, whether you look from 2000 or from 2018. So investors might want an extra return for the risk, but the market itself doesn’t actually provide it. At the end of the day, your opportunity cost is what the real market gives you, and in Turkey’s case, that “extra risk” doesn’t translate into extra return.

1nqcnct,investing,Is Auto-Investing in P2P lending a viable option?,"I’ve been exploring ways to diversify my investment strategy and read about the concept of auto-investing in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending on [https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/](https://lendermarket.com/lendermarket-risk-rating/) . Essentially, P2P platforms allow you to automatically invest in consumer loans based on predefined criteria such as loan terms, interest rates, and risk ratings.

One of the key attractions of these platforms is the potential for relatively high returns. Many P2P lending platforms offer average annual returns in the range of 15-18%. While these returns can be appealing, they typically come with a higher risk profile compared to traditional investments, which is something to carefully consider.

To manage risk, many P2P lending platforms offer risk rating systems to evaluate loan originators. These ratings consider factors such as financial stability, legal structure, and transparency. By investing in loans with lower-risk originators, you can reduce the likelihood of defaults, though higher returns often come with higher risk.

A notable feature is the buyback guarantee offered by some platforms. If a loan becomes overdue for a certain period, the platform’s originator repurchases the loan, ensuring the principal and accrued interest are returned to the investor. This buyback provision can offer some peace of mind, but it’s essential to remember that there’s still a risk of delays or defaults, especially in cases where loans are extended multiple times.

Another consideration is the lack of liquidity in most P2P lending platforms. Unlike stocks or mutual funds, you can't sell your investments before they mature unless a secondary market is available. This means that your capital could be tied up for a significant period, potentially reducing flexibility in case you need to access funds quickly.

I’m curious if anyone here has experience using auto-investing in P2P lending. What has been your experience in terms of returns, risk management, and overall performance? Any thoughts on balancing risk and return when using such platforms?",0,2,2025-09-25 17:15:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nqcnct/is_autoinvesting_in_p2p_lending_a_viable_option/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461110
1nqce1i,investing,Helping my 24 yo with their 401k,"I've offered to match my son's contributions to his 401k through the end of this year.  (Prior to this offer, he has contributed to the max of the employer match, then separately fully funded his Roth for the year)

1nq3flz,investing,Potential Ukraine peace push? Impact on energy markets if Russia is pressured to negotiate,"Zelensky recently claimed that Trump promised to “consider” providing Ukraine with weapons that could force Putin to the negotiating table.

If such a scenario plays out, the market implications could be huge especially for energy.

Oil & Gas: Russia remains a major supplier globally despite sanctions. A credible peace push could ease fears of supply disruptions and potentially bring more Russian crude/natural gas back into legitimate global channels. On the flip side, if escalation happens before talks, we could see another spike in Brent/WTI.

Europe: European natural gas prices have been extremely sensitive to the war. A genuine move toward peace could stabilize or even depress prices, but if the path is rocky, volatility might remain high. LNG exporters in the U.S. (LNG, CQP) could be impacted if Europe shifts away from emergency buying.

Energy Stocks: Majors like XOM, CVX, Shell, BP might see headwinds if peace reduces the risk premium baked into energy markets. On the other hand, stability could boost refining margins and long-term demand planning.

Broader Commodities: If peace looks real, agricultural and fertilizer markets might calm (Ukraine/Russia being key wheat & potash exporters). That could ease global inflation pressures.",19,38,2025-09-25 10:45:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nq3flz/potential_ukraine_peace_push_impact_on_energy/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461158

1npzzyt,investing,"Why is a 2% mortgage a ""great"" business for a bank when other investments seem way better?","I'm having trouble understanding the logic of why a bank would lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 30-year mortgage at a very low interest rate (say, 2%). As an individual investor, this seems like a terrible return, especially when safer assets like government bonds sometimes offer even higher yields.



I've heard all the simple answers, but none of them seem to fully hold up. My doubts are:



\- The ""Spread"" Argument: People say banks profit on the spread between the interest they pay on deposits and the interest they earn on the loan. But I understand banks create money when they lend, not just lend out existing deposits. So why create money for a low-return mortgage instead of for something more profitable?



\- The ""Low-Risk"" Argument: The loan is secured by a house, making it low-risk. But there have been times when long-term government bonds were both safer and had a higher yield than mortgages. Yet banks kept issuing mortgages. This can't be the only reason.



\- The ""It's the Law"" Argument: The final answer I get is that banks are legally forbidden from creating money to buy bonds? Okay, but that feels like a circular argument. It doesn't explain why the entire financial and regulatory system is seemingly built to make mortgages the absolute best, most profitable thing a bank can do with its unique power to create credit???



I feel like the real answer involves something deeper. Can anyone explain the real, non-simplified rationale here?",190,390,2025-09-25 07:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npzzyt/why_is_a_2_mortgage_a_great_business_for_a_bank/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461201

Looks like for year 2026, those with Social Security wages of $150,000+ will be required to make catch-up contributions to 401(k)/403(b) to after tax Roth IRA. Questions... I assume this is not adjusted gross income for income limit? I don't have social security wages, since I'm in a state pension system. My ""medicare wages"" are just above $150,000, so looks like I'll be impacted. I'm 61yo, and last year maxed out pretax 403(b) contributions at $34,750 and Roth at $8,000. For high earners, will the Roth limit increase beyond the $8,600 for year 2026 for those 50yo+? For example, 50yo with earnings below $150,000 will have a Roth max of $8,600 (standard $7,500 + catchup $1,100), but higher earners will have a higher limit, because catchup contributions that were previously pretax get added? Or will the catchup amount still be just $1,100?  Looks like I'll have $11,500 less in pretax 403(b) contributions.

1npncdh,investing,Be careful with quantum stocks,"I'm an engineer, and my sphere of competence is technology. I'm a believer in quantum computers. Here's why I think it's a bad idea to invest in quantum stocks.

You see, a successful business is not determined by how advanced the technology is, but by its ability to generate a pile of money. Business, first of all, is a cash generator. And we, as investors, want to own great cash generators. The problem with quantum stocks is that none of them are great businesses (aside from maybe IBM and Google, which aren't really ""quantum stocks"").

Let's put aside the complexity of quantum computing and how difficult it is to scale. Let's assume we've solved all technical issues. Do you know how much it costs to build and maintain a quantum solution? Do you know how much it would cost to develop commercialized mass-manufacturing? To educate the personnel? The answer: a freaking unimaginable amount.
  
There's no company in Taiwan that will print you quantum chips on demand. There aren't millions of quantum engineers and software programmers waiting to be employed. The infrastructure does not exist. Quantum technology won't be scalable for decades - maybe half a century.
  
You can't even compare quantum to the AI revolution. AI is still silicon-based and can reuse existing infrastructure. Quantum technology reimagines our entire approach to computing from scratch. And it costs a hell of a lot of money (tons of debt, none of profit).

None of the companies on the market will dominate the quantum space. They're not businesses - they're research labs (and some are scams). The companies that will eventually build infrastructure, hire engineers, and scale to the market don't exist yet.

Technology doesn't mean business. Research doesn't mean cash. And sadly, even established companies with fully built infrastructure and strong brands can fail as businesses (sorry, Intel, I'm talking about you).

See how absurd it is that current quantum stocks already have billions in market cap, sitting alongside successful businesses? These companies print flashy news releases and talk big about how quantum will change everything. They exploit public ignorance about technology to sell wet dreams stuffed with money bags. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Your money will soon end up in the pockets of insiders and hedge funds.

This is a reality check not just for quantum stocks, but for tech hype in general. Think twice where you put your money. Maybe it's better to take your profit, consider yourself lucky, and buy your girlfriend flowers or a house?

Not investment advice, of course, but I'd rather put a smile on a girl's face than invest in quantum. ;)

P.S.
When in doubt, trust fundamentals, not your biases. Don't fool yourself into thinking you would've picked Nvidia in 2015 if you only had the information available in 2015. Today is the same - you don't know who's going to be the champ in 2035. It will surprise us all.",739,224,2025-09-24 20:38:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npncdh/be_careful_with_quantum_stocks/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461268
1npm4f4,investing,Is Celestica (CLS) the quiet “picks & shovels” winner of the AI build-out?,"Seven weeks ago Celestica (CLS) hit the $253 price target I’d set. Since then, the stock has kept climbing, and, more importantly, the fundamentals have strengthened. This isn’t just another contract manufacturer anymore; it’s becoming one of the key suppliers enabling the AI infrastructure boom.



The CCS segment grew 28% y/y in Q2 2025. Its HPS revenue surged 82% y/y, lifting margins and returns. These numbers are being driven by the transition from 400G to 800G network switches, the high-speed plumbing that connects massive GPU clusters. Every major hyperscaler is now ramping 800G programs, and Celestica already has design wins for 1.6T switching racks scheduled to start in 2026.



You can add more GPUs to a cluster, but if the links between them are slow, training times don’t improve. Doubling network speed from 400G to 800G (and soon 1.6T) removes that bottleneck. Celestica spotted this shift early and is now one of the go-to suppliers for ultra-fast switches and racks.



The macro backdrop is also reinforcing the thesis. Nvidia and OpenAI just announced a plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of NVIDIA AI systems for OpenAI’s next-generation infrastructure and Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI to make it happen. Oracle has committed a staggering $300 billion to host OpenAI’s future workloads. All of that AI compute has to live somewhere, connected by somebody’s hardware. Celestica sits in the middle of that supply chain, quietly making the high-speed gear that keeps the AI arms race running.



I’ve raised my fair value estimate for Celestica to $320 per share, up from $253. That’s based on higher CCS growth assumptions (35% instead of 27% in 2025) and a slightly lower cost of capital as visibility and margins improve. The upside comes with risks (concentrated customers and potential capex pauses) but the long-term compounding story is intact.",13,8,2025-09-24 19:50:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npm4f4/is_celestica_cls_the_quiet_picks_shovels_winner/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461283
1npk9m5,investing,Looking For Feedback On Brokerage Allocation?,"35M I made a post recently about being a little late to the game with Roth IRA accounts and just opened one not long ago.  Before, I was investing more unconventionally through real estate, but better late to the Roth retirement account then never.

I came up with a Roth IRA portfolio of: 50% VTI 20% VXUS 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

I've gotten some feedback from that post and have a new split of  50% SPMO 20% XMMO 15% VGT and 15% QQQM.  

Now I was looking for feedback on my brokerage account.  Currently it's comprised of individual stocks that I've just bought and been holding.  It's done quite well recently, up 110% since 2022 but I'm well aware that you could have pretty much picked any stock and made money the past few years.

  
So that leads me to this post, I want to add more stability and start reallocating and distributing my funds differently, mainly adding some ETFs to it.  So this is what I came up with to balance and not overlap the Roth.  

35% VTI 20% SMH 20% SCHD 15% ARKK and 10% to explore ie individual picks.

  
currently my 401k is primarily VOO.

  
Does this seem like a sound strategy, diversification? Any and all feedback welcome and thank you in advance.",2,5,2025-09-24 18:39:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1npk9m5/looking_for_feedback_on_brokerage_allocation/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461287

Has anyone here actually put a small allocation into these developing markets? If so, did you use ETFs, ADRs, or some other route? Just wondering if now is the right time to diversify a little bit, or if the risks (political/regulatory/currency) outweigh the potential upside.

P.S. if your suggestion is yes I can try, then I might start with just a little amount first.

Or also, I’ve been browsing other posts here and kinda got intrigued by pre-IPO investing. People say it could be a way to take a different route instead of chasing crowded public markets. Not sure if that’s more hype than reality though. Curious what others think.

I've been seeing and hearing about a severe bifurcation of capital and opportunity, and the numbers are pretty jarring.

1) ​AI is dominating the market, accounting for 55.2% of year-to-date deal value.

2) ​The concentration of capital is extreme. The ten largest funds are capturing around 43% of total commitments, while overall fundraising is tracking toward an eight-year low.

3) ​Late-stage AI startups are trading at a significant premium, with the median Series D+ pre-money valuation for AI startups approximately three times higher than their non-AI counterparts.

​This intense focus on a narrow sector, while the rest of the market struggles, feels like a potential risk. It makes me wonder if the current market rally is sustainable or if it's masking a deeper liquidity problem.

I have friends across different age groups, countries, and financial situations. They work in a wide variety of industries and have very different incomes. Since investing is one of my hobbies, I often bring it up in conversations. Some of my friends invest heavily, some just do the classic “VOO and chill,” and the majority have never cared about investing at all.

In the past six months I have noticed a shift. A lot of those friends who never cared before have suddenly started showing interest. They are watching YouTube videos about finance, and some have even paid for courses on things like evaluating companies and looking at P/E ratios etc.

On one hand I think it is great, financial education is important and learning how to manage money in your 20s and 30s is crucial. On the other hand I have noticed a concerning pattern. Many of them seem very impatient, which is normal for beginners ( I even consider myself beginner after 9 years investing), but they also sound greedy. Instead of starting with safer, long-term strategies like index funds, they are diving straight into riskier plays such as Chinese markets, emerging markets, and individual stocks.

To me this feels like a red flag that people is getting greedy and market is overvalued. I cannot help but think this behavior might be a stronger signal than any market metric.

I thought I had a good feel of the upward slope of the CAPE and how technology past 20 years might suggest a Shiller PE ratio of 40 might not be a sign of disaster in modern day.

Consider if you normalize the Shiller PE ratio to account for increases in productivity and the ""new normal"" for the level of earnings and productivity per unit capital.

If technology and productivity does not change over time, then Shiller PE graph might look flat, but obviously it is anything but flat for past 25 years.

My ""target"" Shiller PE is \~80 for 2026-2028, jumping to 300-1500 by 3032 depending on social and educational evolution being restructured by pressures from AI.",2,5,2025-09-23 23:45:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nox73q/shiller_pe_ecy_pcape_tr_capeshiller_2018_advice/,2025-09-30 15:06:07.461436
1nox5s0,investing,Thoughts on my portfolio?,"Thoughts on my portfolio? I’m just trying to grow my money. It’s not necessarily for retirement, but I do plan on just keeping it invested to grow for 5+ years probably so that it’s beating inflation and growing to some capacity where I don’t have to necessarily ever feel like I’m strapped for cash 

Investments into the brokerage account started a month ago. 

ETFs:
1) invested $178,765 into VOO between 576 to 606 price per share. 
* Current balance is about $187,730 with around 9k unrealized gain

2)invested $21,571 into QQQM at about $239 per share 
* Current balance is about $22740 with about $650 unrealized gain 

Individual stocks:
1) Invested about $5k in Google at around $190 a share 
* current balance is about $6500 with around $1500 unrealized gain 
2) Invested about $6300 into UNH between $275 and $300 a share
* current balance is about $7600 with about $1300 in gain 
3) invested $1k in Open Door to gamble a bit. I’m down like $300, since I entered last week and it’s been dipping. Shares bought in between 8.40 and 10.40 

Feedback is appreciated. I’m aware that I’m not very well diversified, esp in the international market as I have nothing for that. I also know that the mag 7 is driving up s&p 500, so I’m quite heavy in tech at this time

Should I rebalance, or does it like safe enough? I know past performance does not predict future too, meaning that international market could beat USA in the future and I’m heavy in U.S large cap right now. I guess I am in a way chasing performance, but I’m not sure if many people actually would criticize my selection or see it as fine.

There was of course the market crash a few years ago, but the revised figures should have accounted for that.

My goal is to have 3 million in my 401K, or close to it once I reach retirement age.  Historically, my 401K has averaged at over 15% increase every year.  This year is right around 14%.  My understanding is that I have to pull all my money out of the 401K account and invest it in my Schwab account.  I can invest this money in exactly the same way as it is in my 401K and still earn this 15 or so percent each year.  My question is this, how can I invest this money without paying taxes on the investment and only pay taxes on the withdraw?  Second, if I can do this, and earn lets say 10% each year on this 3 million dollars, that leaves me with 300k to live on each year without touching the principal.

1noqbel,investing,Powell Spoke Today – Here’s the Vibe Check,"The economy remains vibrant, but showing some signs of fatigue. Growth is slowing, job gains are slowing, and unemployment is creeping up. Overall, the economy isn't collapsing, but the party is undoubtedly winding down.



Inflation remains a concern. While below the nightmare scenario of 2022, it hasn't yet returned to the Fed's ""dream"" of a 2% target. Core inflation (sticky inflation) remains lingering. Think of it as a guest at a party that refuses to leave.



Interest rates: a little high, a little low. Powell called current rates ""modestly constrained."" In other words: they're not stifling the economy, but they're certainly hindering its rapid growth. The Fed has already cut rates slightly, but he made it clear that future rate cuts are not inevitable. The data will tell.



The risks are two-way. Cut rates too quickly? The inflation monster could reawaken. Keep rates too tight for too long? The job market will suffer. Powell essentially said, ""We're winging it, but we're doing it in a very professional way.""



Stocks are expensive. He actually said the market looks ""quite richly valued.""

Key sentences: 

* ""Our vision is simple: we want to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week.""
* ""... it will require innovation at every level of the stack, from chips to power to building to robotics.""
* ""We are particularly excited to build a lot of this in the US; right now, other countries are building things like chips fabs and new energy production much faster than we are, and we want to help turn that tide.""
* ""Over the next couple of months, we’ll be talking about some of our plans and the partners we are working with to make this a reality.""

Any guesses on who they'll partner with mainly? I'm not super into the end-to-end AI infra space but here's what our good friend ChatGPT says are the main areas:

* **Energy generation & supply:** To scale to gigawatt-per-week growth, you need lots of cheap, reliable, low-carbon or zero-carbon power. Also, grid/interconnection infrastructure must handle large loads.
* **Chips / accelerators / custom hardware:** GPUs, TPUs, ASICs, other accelerators for training & inference.
* **Data center / facility design:** Physical buildings, racks, layout, power distribution, mechanical infrastructure (cooling, ventilation), modularity, robotics for construction etc.
* **Cooling / thermal management & power delivery:**  GPUs and accelerators produce lots of heat; cooling strategies (air, liquid, immersion) become critical.
* **Networking & storage / I/O / data movement:** Training large models involves moving large volumes of data between storage, compute, between datacenters, etc. Inference also has latency requirements, so networking bandwidth, latency, storage speed matter.
* **Supply chain and manufacturing:** Everything needs to be manufactured at scale. Also packaging, testing, transport.
* **Software, orchestration, tools:** Software stack to manage hardware: scheduling of training/inference, utilization, monitoring, fault tolerance, optimizing for power, usage, etc. Also tools for model evaluation & selection, efficiency, etc.
* **Regulation, environment, sustainability:** Ensuring that scaling doesn’t blow up carbon emissions, water usage; environmental permitting; policy around energy usage; ensuring power grid stability; social/environmental impact of building huge facilities.

**Who are the top contenders in each area in your opinion?**

I imagine it has to be a company that has appetite for experimentation/innovation. I imagine some will be private cos.",43,35,2025-09-23 16:43:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nomhws/sam_altmans_new_blog_post_who_are_the_infra/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.297749

I have just noticed that there is a new ETF IE000FJJZA01 (since Dec 2024) that tracks S&P 500 Developed Quality FCF Aristocrats.  
Comparing the quality metrics, SP goes for Free Cash Flow metrics (FCF margin = FCF / Revenue; FCF ROIC) and MSCI to standard metrics (ROE and Debt to Equity).

Cash Flow seems more a transparent metric and less manipulated with accruals and so on by the companies when comparing to ROE and others  
Do you have the same perspective?

I am actually building a factor portfolio and I am looking to add one of this in order to reduce a bit the volatility.

As the title says, I will be transitioning to Fidelity soon based on the advisor fees that I am currently paying. The wife and I set this account nearly 30 yrs ago at a time when we didn't know anything and the ability to trade and manage your money was a lot more cumbersome.  Over that time our two ROTHS have grown and are now at $500k (total)) which puts our yearly management fees at just under 5K.  I am kind of embarrassed that I let this go for so long but now I want to transition out of managed accounts and into something where we do all of the managing.

The funds within each of our current ROTH's have a decent mixture of bonds, REIT's and other assets but I feel that it could be better and now that I will be going to Fidelity, it opens up access to many more funds.  I'm looking for advise as to what those funds should be

Currently, each ROTH account contains - FEPIX, LLDYX, MXFIX, COST, MSFT, QQQ, SLV, IVE, IJH, ICF, IJR and VEU

Some more background might help as well -

The wife and I have 3 more years of work.. We have 75K in a HYSA and all our monthly expense, once we stop working at 60, will be covered by my military pension and disability rating. Our military health care covers us until we hit Medicare age. We also have (2) 401ks @ \~ 600k total so the ROTH money will remain largely untouched for at least the next 10-15 yrs.

1nobhab,investing,Vaneck NLR ETF any good for a short-term (3 to 6 months) investment?,"The latest recommendation from my adviser is to buy into it because he thinks that it's worthwhile diversifying into the power market due to high demand. Hold for a few months, and sell if ever goes up by 10%.

I will be selling some of my existing Vanguard ETFs to facilitate this, about 5%. It's not a big move, just exposure into different markets. I'm happy with my current asset allocation.

1noaiau,investing,"My take on the new AI arms race: NVIDIA's partnerships are a big deal, but what does it mean for the rest of us?","I've been hearing a lot about these new AI partnerships, and it feels like a new infrastructure arms race is starting. From what I've seen and heard, Nvidia is solidifying its position, and Oracle is becoming a huge player in the AI cloud.

1) The Nvidia-OpenAI deal is massive, with a commitment of up to $100 billion. It feels like Nvidia is locking in its biggest customer and ensuring its dominance.

2) The Nvidia-Intel partnership, with a $5 billion stock investment, seems like a smart way to de-risk Nvidia's supply chain and give Intel a direct line into the AI space.

3) I've also heard that Oracle is becoming a central player in the AI cloud, securing key contracts and positioning itself for massive growth.

All this new, energy-intensive infrastructure for ""AI factories"" is going to put a huge strain on global energy grids and supply chains. It feels like there are new investment opportunities and risks popping up everywhere.

1no8ea2,investing,50RR Trade called out this weekend... Did you miss it? A perfect setup brought to you by Trend Analysis,"Hi all, Chartstradamus here.  I wanted to highlight a trade I called out both in this weekends update and yesterdays daily update. (For proof image 2, or my post history)

It is the 3rd of the 3 setups I trade, I've done some previous updates highlighting the other 2 over the past month.

This setup is a breakout strategy on the failure of an established trend.  On the break of the trend structure I will enter heavy on a retest and generally an impulse leg should bring us to the target zone of the over-riding trend.

For reference the Purple 15m bear structure was established and unchanged on my chart from middle of last week.  

The Blue 1H bull structure was established weeks ago and has remain unchanged as well.

The setup played out perfectly, with a clean test, break, and retest of the breakout line (circled in the 1st image) and a strong impulse toward the target area (the dotted blue line).

This is how good TA works, I am not necessarily predicting something is going to happen.  As I stated in yesterdays update I was actually short going into the day.  

I am just identifying inflection points in the market ahead of time, and depending how the market reacts to those areas plotting a trade from there. 

Wth extended targets and stops outside of structure that if they were to hit I would be sure of a directional change.

I'm up over 10k in profits more than doubling my account in under a month during this forward test.

1no662i,investing,Rollover a 403(b) account?,"Hello,

I have a 403(b) account through my old non-profit job called 'The Retirement Plan Company' or 'TRPC.' I started a new job a few months ago, and opted for their pension plan through WA state. My job also has a voluntary investment program through Fidelity that I can contribute to. I don't have much more money to invest outside of my pension right now, but I do have the option to contribute as little as $15/month to their Fidelity program (but I may be able to contribute more as time goes on). I have a separate Fidelity Go account with a little money in it for my daughter's college when she gets older too. 

My question is - should I rollover my TRPC 403(b) to my current employers Fidelity investment program and then contribute $15 a month?

1no05ld,investing,Oklo Breaks Ground on First Aurora Powerhouse,"See link for today’s live reporting by Fox News at Idaho National Labs: https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6379935505112

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",15,1,2025-09-22 22:09:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1no05ld/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.297977

I want to get my mother more in the mindset of just investing into one etf instead of trying to buy individual stocks since she isn’t the most technologically inclined and she doesn’t do the most research imo.

I am here to ask if the one etf to invest in would still be the commonly recommended VOO,QQQ, or VTI or if her having a shorter timeframe for how long she can invest changes what options would be best.

I soured on the syndication, but like the idea of finding something to arbitrage. For those who use margin (or SBLOCs), is buying an ETF index like VOO or VGT advisable with the margin account? I was also thinking about using it for a different real estate or other Reg D syndication to give diversification but am a little spooked on those. Note that the taxable brokerage account is already all VOO and VGT and there are IRA accounts having those same, and and also slightly more stock diversification.

1nnytkk,investing,My predictions for 2035 -what will be a goldmine and what will be a spectacular collapse,"**1. Corporate jobs, white-collar, office jobs, working for corporations** -this has already been revealed as a scam career nobody thinks seriously about since how companies use AI to layoff people.

I would not invest my career path into being a cog in the corporate machine.
Layoffs, optimizing quarterly earnings by offshoring, and AI are taking over.
In my opinion, these jobs are too risky. The ultimate goal of corporations is to cut costs on employees, pay them as little as possible while keeping them from quitting, and maintain a constant large supply of workers (including migrants) to create endless competition and an employer’s market.

It’s very risky to invest in corporate jobs. I would stay away, even if today tech, finance, etc. offer good salarie because your job existence depends on whether the corporation wants you or not. It’s a pointless career in the era of AI.

**2. Independent career paths**

Jobs and professions where your clients are ordinary people and you control how much you work and who you work for. Dentists, nurses, hairdressers, car mechanics, builders, plumbers.
Services you provide directly to ordinary people, work independent from boss and managers.

**3. Small business owners**
Again, independent jobs outside the traditional 9-5 corporate slavery, without bullshit like time tracking and annual performance reviews. Local pizzerias, restaurants, beauty salons, electronic shops, food shops, etc.

**4. Marketing and influencing**

Having a large following userbase, being public and visible on the internet, building a community, being a YouTuber,  with 100k+ subscribers.
Why? Because it allows you to leverage that audience to create businesses you already have a ready user base.

**5. Innovations against capitalism and corporate culture**

Since the job market is terrible and will be even worse in the future, all innovation around fighting consumerism, anti-capitalism, and small alternatives (to McDonald’s, Amazon, Facebook etc.) will grow. 20 years ago, these companies were liked by people because they were innovative and helped improve people’s lives. Now they hoard all the profits for themselves and harm society, the economy, and the job market. People hate large companies now, and they will be seeking friendly, ethical, anticapitalistic alternatives who share profits with ordinary people and make their life better.

In the future, angry people who lost their jobs due to AI will also move away from large corporations. Just like iPhones will become outdated the way BlackBerry phones did, alternatives to Amazon and other corporate giants will emerge.

The next trend is anticonsumerism. All innovations that provide alternatives to AI, big corporations, and consumerism will grow. This is especially visible in Gen Z and Gen Alpha. Being poor and frugal will be cool. A few years ago, people admired influencers and celebrities now they hate them for flaunting luxury lives they’ll never have.

Previously, wearing Louis Vitton and rolex was considered impressive, but now people laugh at that. Wearing Temu clothes is seen as cooler because everyone knows buying overpriced products is for losers. Among the younger generation, wearing Louis vitton or riding a porsche isn’t a flex anymore, it’s cringe. People despise these status symbols, seeing them as losers tricked into buying overpriced corporate bullshit that’s worth $1 instead of the $10 000 they paid.

**6. Loneliness epidemic**

This is a huge problem. Right now people replace their social contact with tiktok and social media, but even though they use it, they still crave real human connections. Anything, businesses or innovations that solves this problem and unites the younger generation could be the next airbnb level innovation.

**7. Squeezing money from services for the middle class and rich**

All the work and services where the rich are consumers will provide a lot of money. Cleaning their houses, quality food for the wealthy, nannies, spas, luxury brands, etc. Prices for services targeting the rich will rise.
Just like corporations raise prices for products while cutting labor costs, people providing direct services for the rich (cleaning ladies, nannies, food delivery, spas, etc.) will raise their rates, squeezing money from the rich. People hate the rich and will overvalue these services as a way to get money back. 

**8. Investing in stocks**

I believe the UBI of our time will be investing in stocks guaranteed profit in the era of AI. On one hand, we can hate AI as corporate robbery used to lay off people. But on the other hand, we can ride the wave and invest in their stocks.

The recession isn’t coming in the next 10 years, corporations have everything in place now. The poor will struggle, but the capital market doesn’t care. Capital markets exist to make money.

Investing, especially in AI companies, is a safe bet. Ordinary people may dislike AI, but billionaires are already pouring money into it and will continue to. Large cap stocks at this point are like a safe UBI with 20-30% YoY gains.

What do the rich do if they want more money? They invest in stocks. Years ago, the stock market saw recessions, 20% drops, Black Mondays, banking crises, etc. Now the stock market doesn’t even react to that. The rich pour their money into stocks because they’re too lazy to create something new with real value they just click, buy stocks, and do nothing while their capital multiplies.",0,1,2025-09-22 21:14:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnytkk/my_predictions_for_2035_what_will_be_a_goldmine/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298057
1nnyjfw,investing,Should We Trust AI With Our Investments Researches?,"There has always been debate on how much trust to place in AI when it comes to investing. The benefits are easy to notice. It can process massive amounts of data faster than any individual, scanning price action, news, sentiment, and even onchain flows in real time. It also takes emotions out of the equation, offering signals that are more structured and less tied to fear or greed. For investors who want speed and efficiency, it feels like having an assistant that never sleeps.  
  
But there are also clear drawbacks. It is built on patterns and past data, which means it cannot fully predict sudden shocks, unexpected changes in sentiment, or events that can move markets overnight. It can also make traders overconfident if they begin to trust it too much, forgetting that markets are still shaped by human behavior and unpredictability. Another concern is that if too many people use similar tools, trades might become crowded, reducing the edge that individuals are looking for.  
  
These pros and cons make me think more carefully about how it could fit into my own investing approach. because I usually rely on bitget for my digital investments, but with the platform now upgraded into a Universal Exchange that combines crypto, futures, and even tokenized stocks in one place, the idea of using it there is becoming more tempting. I see how something like GetAgent could reduce the amount of manual research I do by pulling real-time prices, tracking smart money movements, and reading sentiment in one screen instead of many.  
  
The real question for me is whether I should actually bring it into my routine or just keep it as an optional tool. Should it remain a supportive layer in the background, or is it worth giving it a higher level of trust in making decisions? I have not yet committed to it because I want to weigh these points carefully. It feels like the future of investing is moving in this direction, but I am still curious to hear whether others think it should guide decisions directly or simply provide data that we interpret on our own.",0,6,2025-09-22 21:03:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnyjfw/should_we_trust_ai_with_our_investments_researches/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298063

The idea would be to make discovery easier for both sides founders, startups, or even individuals looking for capital could browse funds in an open, transparent way instead of relying only on closed networks or word of mouth.

Ideally, these platforms would include smart filters and structured data:

1nnxk2e,investing,Is the mainstream narrative on gold/silver changing?,"Jeff Gundlach. the  billionaire bond king, now recommends pulling out of bonds so you have at least a 25% allocation to gold; Mike Wilson, CIO of Morgan Stanley, just released a recommendation for a 20% (it was zero I think) allocation to gold.

Late to the game? Or is the game still in its initial innings?

Is GDX or SIL the new NVDA’s? You need a lot of silver to support those data centers. Central banks now collectively hold more gold than treasuries and they’re still buying.

1nnti8f,investing,Stocks is giving me a better return than crypto.,"I might receive a lot of hate for this but I sold all my crypto weeks ago, was holding cash collecting pennies on stable coins but now full ported into heavy tech, now up 13% in 3 mo, while BTC is slowly dropping and/or dead movement.  

I ditched ETFs a few days ago (SPY/QQQ) because those are safe options and I'm investing in tech with good growth and company financials / fundamentals. 

I've been in crypto since early 2017s and imo BTC isn't an investment anymore, rather a pump n dump. Big corp. has control over it now, the more they have invested the more they have control over it. I knew this in the back of my mind when government slowly took control. The more BTC rises the more money needs to pour into it to get a return. 

Alt coins give you a nice return but I don't want to put in the search effort that can potentially be a dead coin months later. 

Two of my friends in my discord also convinced me to pull from BTC, and there reasoning was, you need a lot of capital to make a % of what the returns were. 

Was also watching a podcast with tucker carlson and his guest said government and big corp want full control of BTC to pump and dump and use buyers liquidly to pay off national debt, take it with a gain of salt.

I looked up how much BTC does on year average says 20%ish - which is very good, except exchanges take a huge cut of your profits. Even had coinbase+ still was losing on it. Switched to kraken instead. During the bull run I made a decent amount then sold for profits but lowkey if I had NVDA/PLTR I would profit off growth/fundamentals instead of an ""agreement"". 

Lastly, my mentor himself who got me introduced to options even said he doesn't touch/hold BTC and hes been invested in the stock market for 10+yrs and made 10M+. 

Just my opinion would love peoples thoughts.

1nnk8wj,investing,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds.

1nnfyrl,investing,Why EnSilica is Worth Possibly 13x its Current Price (Updated),"Okay, so you are probably thinking… yeah right, here’s that degenerate Double Bubbler banging on about that penny stock again. Well take a brief moment and read the following to see why my opinion is not so outlandish. You may one day thank me for it.

EnSilica develops custom semiconductor chips called ASICs. Essentially dedicated silicon expertly designed to a particular task such as providing encryption for Internet of Things devices, or efficiently moving data across satellite networks as will hopefully soon be the case with their custom ASIC for AST Space Mobile.

Recently MDA Space acquired a relatively low profile Israeli firm Satixfy for $280m in an all cash offer. Satixfy being a competitor to EnSilica in the ASIC marketplace and high growth satellite communications industry, with 2024 revenue of $20.6m. So that acquisition price is over 13x last year’s revenue!

Compare that with EnSilica’s forecast FY25 revenue (to be confirmed in results anticipated next month) of approximately $25m to $27m as well as a forecast FY26 revenue of between $44m and $47m with ‘80% of FY 2026 revenue already covered by existing customer contracts’ according to EnSilica’s trading update on the London Stock Exchange in April. *Please note I have used the current FX rate to convert figures that were originally quoted by EnSilica in GBP.*

Consider also that another competitor of EnSilica’s is Filtronic who have significant contracts with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Given the importance of Filtronic’s ASICs to SpaceX it has formed a strategic alliance with the firm and acquired 10,949,079 warrants - 5% of the current share capital of Filtronic - which would give SpaceX the opportunity to acquire a notable stake in the firm. Why would it want that? Well in my opinion to ensure they could have a say in the future direction of the firm as well as perhaps giving them the opportunity to create a defensive position to fend off hostile takeovers of Filtronic.

On the subject of Filtronic it is worth considering their forward price-to-sales ratio compared to EnSilica’s. EnSilica trades at a forward PS of just over 1.12 (against the low end of their current FY26 forecast) which compares to Filtronic‘s forward PS of 5.3 according to Simply Wall St data. If EnSilica achieves a similar forward PS as it approaches it’s anticipated medium term sales projection of c.£100 per year (hopefully together with a healthy profit margin) then you could see a market capitalisation of £500m+. That’s 13.44 times the current share price.

Who do I think are likely contenders to acquire EnSilica? Well Qualcomm could be a prime candidate in my opinion. Or another large and diversified semiconductor manufacturer that appreciates and can take advantage of the breadth of EnSilica’s IP, not just the sat comm work but including the post quantum encryption chip, optical networking design IP and automotive radar IP which is being developed in tandem with Radareye following funding from a consortium including Transport for London, IAG and Admiral.

Another possibility is AST Space Mobile, who EnSilica signed a contract with for a high value satellite ASIC in 2021 and which I understand will be a core component within AST’s BlueBird Block 2 satellite constellation scheduled for launch in the coming year or so. I consider AST a possibility as I wouldn’t be surprised that over time they broaden their offering to more fully compete with SpaceX’s Starlink (e.g. higher bandwidth satellite comms with guaranteed quality of service via terminal devices for static and mobile situations). EnSilica has a suite of IP for satellite terminals (a market which is worth billions of dollars) and owning that IP could help AST better compete with Starlink in that scenario.

I can also see U.S. and European companies such as Boeing, Airbus or Thales taking interest, especially given plans for the European Union’s forthcoming IRIS2 constellation. EnSilica’s IP and talent would seemingly be of great benefit to various industry titans in the satellite communications race that is heating up rapidly.

While I would like to see EnSilica grow to become a future British tech champion, I could understand the management accepting an offer of approximately 13x FY26 revenue. With a notable holding myself, I would not complain either.

While EnSilica’s share price fell last week, I still have immense conviction in this promising company and my recent discussion with Chairman Mark Hodgkins has only given me additional confidence in its future long term potential.

Yes, the share price may be turbulent in the times ahead however I may accumulate further should weakness persist (as I did last week) or following what I feel is an unlikely near term event, a rights issue, as is rumoured on ADVFN for example. 

EnSilica is a company I intend to hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for being acquired at a significant multiple to its current value.

May fortune favour the brave!",14,20,2025-09-22 07:24:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnfyrl/why_ensilica_is_worth_possibly_13x_its_current/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298270
1nnf3pl,investing,NVIDIA and Intel Just Partnered. Is This the End of the Road for AMD or a New Era of Competition?,"seismic event just happened in the semiconductor world, and it has major implications for investors. NVIDIA and Intel announced a historic collaboration, with NVIDIA investing $5 billion in Intel and forming a joint venture to co-develop new chips for AI and personal computing.

This partnership is a big deal because it brings together two of the biggest players in the industry, which immediately sent shockwaves through the market. While Intel's stock saw a massive jump of up to 30%, competitors like AMD saw their shares drop by over 9% in initial trading.

Analysts are now debating the long-term impact on the competitive landscape.

1) For AMD: The concern is that the new partnership could create a powerful, integrated offering that directly challenges AMD's products in both the data center and consumer markets. This move may put pressure on AMD to accelerate its own product launches and strategies.

2) For the Alliance: The deal could be seen as a way for Intel to get a much-needed lifeline and a direct path into the AI space, while NVIDIA gains a massive partner to expand its ecosystem.

What's your take? Is this the beginning of the end for AMD, or will this simply force them to innovate faster and make the market even more competitive?",149,105,2025-09-22 06:30:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnf3pl/nvidia_and_intel_just_partnered_is_this_the_end/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298278

1nne3rb,investing,"In the Trump 2.0 era, the dollar is taking the strain","I’ve been trading for over 7 years now, mainly in Forex and commodities, and what I’m seeing in the markets lately feels very familiar yet different at the same time.

The dollar is under pressure, even as U.S. equities continue to rally. To me, the stock market’s strength looks like a mask, underneath there’s real anxiety about the direction of the world’s largest economy. Policy shifts, global uncertainty, and changing capital flows are all in play.

From my experience, when the dollar strains like this, it creates ripple effects:

Commodities often gain more attention.

Export-heavy companies can benefit while import-heavy ones feel the pain.

Investors start searching for hedges outside of the traditional stock-bond mix.


I’ve actually prepared a detailed report on the USD outlook and the potential spillover effects into other markets. Alongside that, I’ve built a list of stocks and commodities I believe are worth watching in this environment.

1nnd9am,investing,Why Gold Is About to Take a S**t-Ton of Power From the US Dollar,"Source: Interesting video from Bravos Research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D5geZvfzs&t=1s&ab_channel=BravosResearch

In summary, they think the value of the US dollar is being repriced against gold, a trend that has happened twice before in history (1970-1980 and 1999-2011), when the dollar lost 90% of its purchasing power against gold. A rise in gold prices often coincides with systemic economic issues and a rising US unemployment rate because a weakening economy prompts the government to lower interest rates and increase spending, which makes the US dollar and Treasury bonds less attractive to investors.

While gold prices are currently rising, the unemployment rate is still low. This is attributed to three reasons:

1/Global Geopolitical Uncertainty: Governments and central banks are diversifying into gold as a safe-haven asset.

2/Devaluing Government Policies: The US government is running a large budget deficit, and the Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates, which are policies that typically devalue the currency and lead investors to gold.

3/Anticipation of Future Recession: Gold's rise may be in anticipation of a future recession, as consumer confidence is low despite the low unemployment rate.

TLDR: Although stocks may continue to rise in the short term, gold is likely to continue outperforming them.

What do folks think of this analysis? Make sense, or something is missing?",353,145,2025-09-22 04:40:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nnd9am/why_gold_is_about_to_take_a_stton_of_power_from/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298308

1nn8s2u,investing,The reason I’m shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I’ve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been heavily declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Those are the main points. I’m sure there are some more that you guys could think of but I thought I would share what I thought about Harley Davidson.",28,37,2025-09-22 00:53:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nn8s2u/the_reason_im_shorting_harleydavidson_hog/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298334

1nmnmh3,investing,"Late cycle consumer spending shift = downside CMG, SG, etc?","TL;DR: bearish Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen. Looking for suggestions on similar situations. The devaluation of fast casuals, lululemon feels like a symptom of shifting culture and consumer behaviour. Inflation, portion size shrinking, declining economic activity, consumer fatigue, non existent brand loyalty, and limited scope to rebrand, reinvent, optimize. Late-cycle cultural and consumer-spending shift, where former aspirational brands (fast casual, athleisure, boutique fitness, “accessible luxury”) have gone from status signifiers to punchlines.

Six years ago I visited a Lululemon store for the first time having been familiar with the brand for many years. I knew the brand as a high quality expensive semi boutique level product associated with Soul Cycle, Equinox etc. The store gave a different impression. Some of the clothes were wrinkled and badly presented, customer service was non existent, and they seemed to have no inventory. I assumed it was a one off bad example. But over the following six years I saw the same symptoms again and again and again. Meanwhile, other clues appeared: bigger and bigger sales discounts; diversification into non-sports products with no cohesive direction; a noticeable drop in quality of some garments (I’ve received a few Lululemon gifts down the years). Competitors with cheaper, equally good quality gear eating their market share. 


When I read about $LULU’s demise, I thought “oh course!” (hindsight’s easy, huh?) and began thinking who’s next? While already down bad this year, I can’t help shake the feeling Chipotle, Cava, Sweetgreen have much more downside risk. The traction gained by the “slop bowl” meme to describe their offerings feels like the Chipotle’s Mr Big dying on a Peloton bike moment. An increasing number of comedians joke about slop bowls and the term “slop bowl” has spiked to four times its previous highs on Google search trends this week. It sounds trivial, but this pervasive content influences our tastes, prompts us to take a look in the mirror at stuff we do on autopilot. I think small rallies / dead cat bounce short covering strength just offer nice entry position opportunities to get short.

With inflation rising sharply, portion sizes shrinking, declining quality of ingredients being masked with higher and higher salt content, these brands need to reinvent in other directions. Trouble is, I don’t know where they can turn. I don’t trust they do either. 

The 2010-19 period brought Netflix, Spotify, fast casual lunch spots with “healthy options” and “fresh ingredients”, it brought Equinox and Soul Cycle and F45 and Amex Platinum lounges to create the illusion for aspirational young professionals that they’ve made it to the top. That illusion is being dismantled. Costs are spiralling, fees are rising, and all these brands and business models feel tired and dare I say a bit embarrassing? These brands were once exciting and pleasing. Aspirational. Now, they feel tired and clichéd. Their complacency isn’t deserving of our money and I think they are heavily exposed to a new wave of disruptors over the coming years.

The 2010-19 era saw consumer spending shift away from luxury goods, cars, Electronics and refocus on travel, food, lifestyle. With more Americans owning passports than ever before and travelling to Europe in record numbers, it might sound silly to claim we’re at a turning point from experience-centric consumer spending, but I truly think we’ve reached saturation point in this cultural cycle. I suspect we’re seeing the beginning of the end of this cycle with no clear path to what the next looks like. 

One thing’s for sure: queueing up every day to buy $20 cardboard bowl of rice, cheese, soggy chicken, greens, some kind of flavored salty liquid labelled as dressing is an undignified experience we will come to laugh at in years to come.",20,6,2025-09-21 09:34:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nmnmh3/late_cycle_consumer_spending_shift_downside_cmg/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298405

So I've been investigating for a few years now, various ETF's, GICs, some stocks,  an TFSA and RRSP but I'm finally starting to see a bit of profit on some of my more ""gambly"" stocks.

It started off with cannabis stocks (I'm Canadian) years ago and I got burnt. Not a huge deal tbh since it was something I considered a bitmof a gamble.

I'm trying to find guidance on when to sell and when to simply hold for the long term. 

It's not that I need the money right now but it might be nice to pay down some debt or maybe put it onto my mortgage. Or hell even to sell and put the money into a new sub $20 stock and try to grow it from there.

1nm58pv,investing,Opening Discussion About RDDT,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",7,5,2025-09-20 18:09:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm58pv/opening_discussion_about_rddt/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298506
1nm2vdm,investing,$LENZ Therapeutics - VIZZ Eye drop relieves farsightedness for 10 hours and gives most users 20/20 vision.,"Hello true to my name I have some DD on a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read??” Let’s bring those big Mr scientist science terms to reality.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. For those of you like me with an IQ below your waist size. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you. With Boomers refusing to retire they need this product like a fish needs water.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient that doesn’t effect the muscles around the eye but rather the dilation of the pupil. It creates a pinhole effect that increases vision up close. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•	Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•	Target population of the US is 128 million people - They are currently scaling up for distribution and plan to start full access in October. Few samples and marketing begins now.

	•	A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year.

	•	The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600 depending on many factors.

⸻

Company Financial Health: Strong

	•	Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•	Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•	This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•	They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•	They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•	It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•	The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•	Cramer likes the stock

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter. My position is small and speculative at about 1% my total net worth. However I plan to add more if good news keeps coming out about their scaling and distribution phase.",2,22,2025-09-20 16:36:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nm2vdm/lenz_therapeutics_vizz_eye_drop_relieves/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298539

1nm2mck,investing,Taxable brokerage and ideas for early retirement plan,"Hello! My husband and I are in our 40s. We both have pre-tax retirements and contribute 15% each (counting employer matches). We both have Roth IRAs that we have are funding.

The original plan was to max out the Roths then the pre-tax, BUT we might have an opportunity to “retire” early (in our early 50s) and live abroad. The income gap to cover will be lower and so will health insurance and healthcare. We can do our traveling in our 50s and then move back in 7-10 years if we wish to. 

We will have our Roth contributions and probably rent from a property we will have managed while we are gone. However, we will also need 35k or so liquid in savings, and I’m trying to figure out the best taxable brokerage to use. Since this money won’t go to traditional retirement investments, where can we start parking savings and still get some growth? We bank and have a small investment account with So-Fi. Roths are with Edward Jones (I know, but my husband has the bigger one and likes talking to a guy and our 529 for our kid in college is there and mine could be moved). Vanguard? Another?

1nlzp7t,investing,Where to invest at the end of Oct,"My wife and I normally save 4K per month after all retirement, HSA, bills, etc. That fluctuates a little on months we take a big trip but fairly consistent. We have a 6 month emergency fund. 

Every month we draw down our account to the 6 month emergency fund with 50% to VTI, 25% to an individual portfolio I manage with individual stocks of varying risk, and 25% straight to a second HYSA (separate from our emergency fund). The second HYSA is because my wife has 0 risk tolerance and I accept that knowing we have cash on the sidelines if there is a huge opportunity from a downturn. 

October is a 3 check month for both of us and my wife changed jobs so we will have a much larger surplus this month with her sign on bonus, PTO payout, and 2 additional pay checks.

1nltg3d,investing,Plot Twist : Good ESG Companies Might Actually Trade Backwards in Emerging Markets,"You know how everyone says futures markets are supposed to lead spot prices because they're more efficient? Well, turns out that might be completely backwards for companies with strong ESG scores in India.

Think about it, if you're tracking a company with stellar environmental and governance practices, you'd expect the usual pattern where futures traders get the info first and spot prices follow. But a recent study analyzing 22 Indian companies across 11 sectors using daily price data shows the opposite happening. For high-ESG companies, the regular stock market is actually leading the futures market.

My take: This could mean one of two things, either the spot market has become incredibly efficient at pricing in ESG information, or there's something fundamentally different about how investors value sustainability in emerging markets compared to the West.

The really wild part? This pattern completely flips for companies with poor ESG scores, where futures do lead spot prices as expected. It's like there are two different pricing universes operating simultaneously.

This has practical implications if you're building ESG-focused portfolios in emerging markets, the traditional technical analysis playbook might not work the way you think.

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max. 

I struggle knowing, however, when to sell. I’m up a good amount on some stocks but I feel like there could be more growth there. 

At the same time, it’s becoming almost impossible to manage 33 stocks at once effectively.

1nljtmn,investing,Gold and market discussion,"I am looking to have a discussion with others on here about gold and it's current role and value in the market.

I think gold is the best investment in the current market climate with everything going on.

Gold's rise has been astounding recently. It has performed 33% YTD, 45% over the last year, and 80% over last 2 years.

Bull cases for Gold:

1. Rate cuts means more money will be pumped into economy. More money supply will only increase gold's value and devalue the dollar.
2. Current administration is trying to weaken the US Dollar which drives up asset prices, including gold.
3. Inflation remains elevated and current tariffs will only add fuel to inflation.
4. Uncertainty with governments globally are spending money on military.
5. Central banks buying up gold.
6. Central banks and investors have slowed purchasing of US treasuries signaling moving away from US assets.

Cons:
1. Gold does not generate income.
2. Possible that inflation does not accelerate.
3. Gold up already massively over the last 2 years. Investors may dump their profits and buy into other assets.


Maybe I am to much of a doomer millennial, but I don't see this stock market holding up in the medium term. Rate cuts will boost the stock market and we may have a minor pull back or two, but by the end of next year the bubble will deflate. Almost every stock metric is screaming overvalued.

And if the bubble does pop, where will people put their money? Are treasuries still the safe haven? Or has US Debt gotten too out of hand? Will more people pile into gold? Silver? Crypto? 

Anyway, just here for healthy discussion about the market outlook over the next year or two.",7,5,2025-09-20 00:14:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nljtmn/gold_and_market_discussion/,2025-09-30 15:06:09.298674

India's regulators just opened up REITs to retail investors and they're getting included in equity indices. This feels like one of those regulatory changes that could actually move the needle.

Context: REITs were mostly institutional before, now everyday investors can get in easier. Plus the equity index inclusion should improve liquidity significantly.

I'm curious about the timing - this comes right as we're seeing institutional money flow into affordable housing elsewhere (Brookfield's $10B+ manufactured housing deal in the U.S., for example).

Anyone with experience in emerging market REITs? Regulatory changes like this usually precede bigger investment waves, but India's property market has its own unique dynamics.

1nlfu0j,investing,What % is considered good above government bonds?,"Hi!

I started investing 5 years ago. Im from hungary, so we have very good yield on government bonds. 6,5% for 3 years bond (this is for citizens only, not institutions).

I have a stock portfolio, which is performing very well. But I dont have an intention to increase it at the time.

Instead with my spare money I started flat flipping, my return on a flip is between 10 and 30% but realistically it will decrease to 10-12% net a year (market is changing).

My question is: what is your oppinion, it is worth to continue flipping for a 10-12% net percentage, or should I put in on bonds, the yield difference is only 3,5-5,5%. Which I know is significant, but bond require no work, flat flipping requires 20 hours a month.

So what so you think, the 3,5-5,5% is worth the 20 hours and headaches, or should I put this time to focus on other things, and just sit on bonds?

1nlevk4,investing,Regarding Investing in Stocks - Scalping/Swings. How often to check companies financials?,"Investing in stocks, using company (valuations, financials, ownership, performance and technical) analysis. 

How often should I be checking up on the overall performance of the stock? For example, Invested in a quantum stock 2 days ago, was already up 7% and sold for profit. I'm not afraid of taxes as long as I'm making profit and reinvesting in other companies that are moving fast. 

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching. 

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

1nlcpmw,investing,Market Returns vs Inflation  (Do I have this right?),"Simple question, and I should know this, but asking here:

To calculate how much retirement savings we will need to maintain a certain budget without our nest-egg ever going down requires some data.  I used to think my investments get a certain rate of return, then they will generate enough income to match or exceed my spending, but then I started thinking about inflation, and how that will impact the AMOUNT of money I need to maintain the lifestyle.

Is it accurate to say that if you subtract inflation from the rate of return, that the difference is sufficient for that calculation?

Example (with fake numbers).   If I wanted to retire with $50k of investment income, and didn't want to spend down my nest egg, I would only need to know two things.  How much savings and at what differential between returns and inflation?   If I wanted $50k, if I had a million dollars and returns were averaging 7%, inflation was averaging 3%, the differential would be 4%, I'd be getting $40k of income.   ($10k short of my goal, so I really need $1.25M)

As I type this, I think it's still wrong, because $40k today is worth more than $40k in 10 years, and it has more spending power now than it will then.

Brazil apparently also has something similar called Pix 

Apparently there's more similar systems popping up in many countries, both utilizing Central banks and operating via QR codes, independent of the american visa/mastercard payment networks, not only are they simple to use, they are purely digital and convenient. 

The most important evidence of their value though is the fact that Murica has attacked both systems, calling[ Qris a 'trade barrier](https://windonesia.com/article/us-cites-qris-as-trade-barrier-but-us-payment-model-unfit-for-indonesia)' or[ Pix 'unfair to Murican companies'](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/07/22/us-investigation-brazil-pix-payment-system/)

This to me signals that those systems are an active threat since after all, them taking over the market means American payment processors like Visa and mastercard will be losing a lot of power and relevance. And people are also politically motivated to find alternatives due to all the censorship those payment networks are pushing for.

Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, there was active following on Investor Village on the Rambus thread with handles like Watzman, CroakerFrog, ScruffyNYC, and many others.  After Intel designated RDRAM the sole memory for their new Pentium chip, Rambus skyrocketed and briefly traded above 100 in early 2000.

I have enough for the down payment now but job uncertainty is keeping me from pulling the trigger.

Would be curious to hear what approach folks here are taking (locking up in a CD, putting it in the actual market, etc). Note the money I’m referring to here is aside from my actual emergency fund, which is 12 months of expenses b/c I work in a very volatile industry.

1nkmcax,investing,"Has anyone invested in Pacaso's through Reg A funding round? Not the investment in the co-ownership of luxury homes (their business model), but the investment in the company's class D shares which is currently open for all (apparently non accredited can buy as well)","To the uninitiated (as I was a couple of days before) - Their business is to offer co-ownership in luxury homes.  Co-ownership in 'home' seems like crazy concept to me (imagine the number of problems you would face in decision making!). 

But given this is a vacation/luxury home - whoever is buying these homes as fractional oowners must be doing it as an investment. Checked on trustpilot - overall owner rating seems high (but less number of reviews <200 - i guess that's because there can be only so many home owners/pacaso customers ?) .

Now to their Reg A class D shares offering -->

I saw their news (paid of course) on sites like morningbrew and likes. And since I searched for it afterwards, i now get to see lots of their ads too. 

 Some things I don't like is their PR. They will be like Pacaso secured Nasdaq symbol PCSO but they are not doing IPO. so why worry about getting a name ?? seems gimmicky. or maybe there is a reason.

This is their first public offering. So I am not sure if anyone heard or has invested in it (apparently 11K people so far have invested 55M + - no way to verify this claim apart from their website.

Their VC investors include top names - like Softbank vision fund. But i am wondering why these investor are not investing now and why is Pacaso instead doing a reg A instead and raising from people instead.

Let's say you were gainfully employed at a high paying job and maximized your 23.5k contribution half way through the year.

Then, you take out a 401k loan with a 8% interest rate that you pay back to yourself...

According to Empower, the 401k loan does not result in your funds being taken out of the market - it just adds the debt.

Doesn't this allow you to contribute more than the max contribution into your 401k? The origination fee for the 401k loan at Empower is only 50 dollars...

Paying the loan plus interest back into the account would theoretically allow you to exceed 23.5k in total contributions since the loan interest does not count against the limit",22,40,2025-09-18 20:54:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nkk2xz/front_loading_401k_contributions_then_401k_loan/,2025-09-30 15:06:10.971669

Must be remote accessible and very secure.

Currently, I am 57 and will stop working when I'm 60. I have two 401k's (one active and one from an old job) that should have a combined value of about 750k when I stop working.  I am looking at making things as easy as possible for my wife when I'm no longer around and while she currently doesn't take an very active role in our retirement planning that will change here in a couple years.

Right now the two 401ks have a variety of funds within them. The older one is a Gov TSP with C, S and I funds, while my active 401k is mainly Large Cap and Small/Mid Cap ETF's.  Do you think it would be ""easier"" for her in the future to have all our pre-tax money in a single account, spread across a couple stable ETF's vice how it is now?  Also, having never done anything like this before, is it a pretty simple process to transfer 401k balances into an IRA?   

Lastly, I assume that I cant simply bring over the same particular ETF's that I currently use since they are ""company managed"" (not sure if that's the correct terminology)  so would i just liquidate all the funds into cash and then transfer the balance into the IRA and go from there?

1nk32sg,investing,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story.

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.

Not financial advice. Just my DD.

1nk1j76,investing,What are these 11% Subordinated Notes?,"My grandma recently passed and I am sorting through her finances. 

I noted she is getting interest from the following investment:

Co-oprative Group Limited 
11% final repayment subordinated notes due 2025
ticker symbol 42TE 
Isin GB00BFXW0630

I’ve googled them and I still just don’t understand how they work. It says they are due in December 2025 - what does that mean? 

She holds over 5500 of these notes and their current value is over £100. Surely that can’t mean they’re worth over £500k? I think I’m missing something key here. The interest she was receiving was about £600 twice a year.",8,12,2025-09-18 07:08:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nk1j76/what_are_these_11_subordinated_notes/,2025-09-30 15:06:10.971801
1nk15dh,investing,How to protect my mom from inflation?,"My mom is in her mid 60’s and is sitting on about $100k+\- usd from her inheritance. It’s all cashiers checks that she refuses to cash and deposit into the bank. Might be something left over from a divorce way back or bankruptcy. Either way, I’ve tried telling her that she’s lost nearly 10% of her cashes spending value this year alone. Invest in SOMETHING at least. She says, “ I need a place to live but I can’t afford one”. Boy will she be shocked when prices rise again and stay elevated… With the rate cuts current and planned, I can foresee even more sticky inflation in our futures. That being said, I’m a casual investor with only my limited experience these past 10yrs. 
My questions are as follows:

1- How do I effectively simplify and explain these current events and how they affect her and her savings. Now and in the future.

2-What is the general consensus on a relatively safe investment with liquidity in approx 2-5yrs? Normally in this situation with her age I wouldn’t recommend stocks. Too volatile even the “safer” bets to guarantee her investments safety in a time frame she could access it. Shoot I’m young enough I’d be riding this thing out but she’s not. Then there’s silver and gold. Both at almost all time highs. That was my first knee jerk reaction but again. Would hate to have her invest in a top of which I couldn’t help her with. Still, with inflationary pressures I think for it’s mobility and stability I think she should stack gold. If she’s not going to invest it through normal channels. 

My family historically hasn’t been the best with money/investments. Best bet would to find a good financial advisor but see previous sentence…I just worry that her fear of making a move will hurt her more than actually doing something to combat this.

I got very lucky to hold a lot of it in a cash account until early April (just didn’t know I HAD to invest it, and bought in right at the post-tariff announcement slump, up 25% because of my naïveté). But now it’s all “Reports show economy about to crash!”, “There’s an AI bubble”, but also “Fed is set to cut rates” and “Markets still up, this is devaluation of the US dollar”

And I’ve acted erratically over the past few months (selling off 1/3 to ALL of my ETF’s, rebuying a diversified portfolio). And now as soon as this buy in reflects in my Fidelity accounts, pretty noticeable decrease.

1njurb9,investing,Why Palantir (PLTR) Is a Strong Buy in 2025,"Palantir Technologies has been a standout performer in 2025, soaring significantly year-to-date on the strength of impressive earnings, AI-driven momentum, and major government contracts. Despite concerns about its high valuation, is this a tech bubble or a justified winner? The evidence suggests Palantir is capitalizing on AI with disciplined growth, profitability, and a strategic edge few competitors can match. Here's why Palantir is a strong buy for 2025, addressing bearish concerns and showing why they fall short.

Palantir's financials demonstrate a rare blend of rapid growth and profitability. First-quarter revenue showed strong year-over-year growth, followed by a record-breaking second quarter, particularly in the U.S. with commercial revenue surging. Full-year revenue for 2024 was robust, but 2025 is accelerating further. Unlike many high-growth tech firms, Palantir is profitable under standard accounting, with a notable net income increase in the second quarter and high operating margins. Cash flow is equally impressive, with significant free cash flow growth, far outpacing peers who often burn cash. Management has raised full-year revenue guidance, signaling confidence in sustained momentum. This combination of growth and financial discipline sets Palantir apart.

The core of Palantir's success lies in its AI Platform, which allows clients to run advanced AI models securely on private data, delivering insights for industries like supply chains, finance, healthcare, and defense. Strategic partnerships amplify this advantage. A groundbreaking collaboration with Microsoft integrates Azure's AI capabilities with Palantir's platform in classified defense environments, described by CTO Shyam Sankar as a major leap forward. Palantir also works with OpenAI and partners on responsible AI with Anthropic and Google. These partnerships are driving real contracts, such as deals with Fannie Mae for fraud detection, NATO for defense intelligence, and various U.S. federal agencies. Palantir's platforms, including Foundry for enterprises, Gotham for government, and Apollo for deployment, are proven and reliable. CEO Alex Karp is using AI internally to boost efficiency, aiming to multiply revenue with a lean workforce, showcasing a commitment to operational excellence.

Palantir's contract portfolio is a cornerstone of its strength, blending long-term government deals with a rapidly growing commercial business. A major U.S. Army agreement signed in mid-2025 consolidates numerous contracts into a multi-billion-dollar framework, praised by Army leadership as a step toward modernization. Additional defense and federal contracts, including classified programs, solidify Palantir's government presence. Meanwhile, U.S. commercial revenue is growing explosively, with a robust pipeline of high-value deals across finance, pharma, and energy sectors, where data security is critical. This balance of government and commercial contracts ensures a steady stream of recurring revenue.

Leadership is a key driver of Palantir's success. Alex Karp, with his bold vision of an AI-driven ""efficient revolution,"" is targeting massive revenue growth with a smaller team. The second quarter was described as phenomenal, with the company exceeding expectations and raising guidance. Founders and executives hold significant stakes, aligning with shareholders, and Karp's control allows a focus on long-term innovation over short-term market pressures. With a strong cash position and minimal debt, Palantir can fund research and weather market fluctuations, maintaining lean operations with high margins.

Compared to peers, Palantir shines. Against data and AI firms like Snowflake, Palantir combines faster growth with profitability, while Snowflake remains unprofitable. [C3.ai](http://C3.ai) shows promise but lacks Palantir's scale and margins. Traditional defense contractors dominate hardware, but Palantir's software and AI focus carves out a unique niche. Big Tech offers cloud services, but Palantir's specialized AI workflows, often in partnership with firms like Microsoft, fill a distinct gap. Karp argues that advanced AI models need Palantir to function effectively in real-world applications.

Skeptics raise valid points. Palantir's valuation, with high price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios, suggests risk if execution falters. However, its rapid growth, consistent outperformance, and major contracts support a premium. Government revenue concentration is a concern, but bipartisan support for AI and defense, along with multi-year deals, reduces risk, while commercial growth diversifies the business. International revenue has been flat, but Palantir's focus on the U.S. market is driving results, with global defense wins adding upside. AI hype could fade, but Palantir's practical applications, from logistics to fraud detection, and strong industry partnerships ensure staying power. Insider selling and Karp's unconventional style raise eyebrows, but significant founder ownership and a long-term focus outweigh these concerns.

Palantir is a leader in AI-driven analytics for critical applications, with strong growth, high margins, and a fortified position in government and enterprise markets. Karp's vision of efficiency is delivering, with quarterly revenue surpassing key milestones. Despite its rally, the market may underestimate Palantir's long-term contracts and commercial expansion. In a world where data is king, Palantir is a leading force. This is a strong buy for 2025.

One of the main risks flagged by Moody's involved the ""counterparty risk"" of Oracle relying on large commitments from a small number of AI companies to fund its business model.""

Counterparty risk is always a key consideration in any type of project financing, particularly where there is a high reliance on revenue from a single counterparty,"" Moody's analysts wrote on Wednesday.""And in our view, Oracle’s data center build is effectively one of, if not the world’s largest, project financing,"" they added.

The analysts further noted the company will see its debt increase faster than its EBITDA, which will contribute to a forecast high leverage of 4x before Oracle's EBITDA begins to outpace its debt.""It is likely that free cash flow will also be negative for an extended period before reaching breakeven,"" the analysts wrote.

1njrayk,investing,LXRX at $1.08  Is there a reason not to buy?,"Hey everyone,

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) is currently trading around **$1.08**, and from what I’m seeing, it looks like they might finally be getting their act together. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **Pipeline & Partnerships:** Their experimental obesity drug (LX9851) has a **partnership with Novo Nordisk** worth up to **$1 billion in milestone payments** with $75M upfront. That’s a huge vote of confidence from a major pharma player.
* **Products Ready for Market:** They still have sotagliflozin (INPEFA®) for heart failure and other metabolic disease candidates. They’ve trimmed commercial operations to focus on **R&D and licensing**, which could mean they’re gearing up to push their promising products to market more efficiently.
* **Price Action:** At $1.08, the stock seems **relatively stable**, suggesting accumulation. For a biotech that’s had its ups and downs, this could be a **setup for a breakout** if upcoming approvals or partnerships play out.
* **Upside Potential:** Analysts have a 12-month price target of **$3.23 on average**, with a range as high as $6.00. If even some of their pipeline works out, that’s a **lot of upside** from the current price.
* **Risks:** Of course, **biotech is always high risk**. Clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals, or delays could still negatively impact the stock. But with the Novo Nordisk deal and streamlined operations, they seem to have **more runway and credibility** than before.

**So, anyone see a reason not to buy at this level?** Could LXRX be the under-the-radar biotech that finally delivers for investors, or is it still too early to tell?",0,22,2025-09-17 22:28:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njrayk/lxrx_at_108_is_there_a_reason_not_to_buy/,2025-09-30 15:06:10.971897

1njkrvj,investing,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 Basis Points, and projected two more cuts in 2025","This is the first time the Fed has eased rates since last December.

Fed governor Stephen Miran preferred to cut rates by a half a percentage point and disagreed with the quarter percentage cut.

The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point with a landslide 11-to-1 vote, setting the target range between 4% and 4.25%.  The 1 vote dissented from Miran, favoring a larger 50-basis-point cut instead.

The **decision of a 25 BP cut** was based mainly on the following:

* **Labor market concerns** with recent job gains have slowed significantly, and the unemployment rate has edged up.
* **Economic slowdown** with indicators suggests economic activity grew at a more moderate pace in the first half of the year.
* **Acknowledged inflation** remains somewhat elevated, but the Fed judged that the rising downside risks to employment warranted a rate cut. 

Officials signaled the possibility of **two more rate cuts** this year.

1njhk2x,investing,"I usually don’t sell this fast, but after a 57% gain in 5 months in Oil-Dri (ODC) I closed the position. The company’s great, the quarter was record-breaking, but the risk/reward isn’t as compelling. What do you think? Anyone looked at ODC before?","I wanted to share something unusual for me. I tend to hold winners for a long time, but I just closed a position in ODC after a 57% gain in five months (bought at \~$43, sold at $68).

Back in April I did a deep dive on ODC and called it a “quiet compounder” hiding in plain sight ([here](https://www.beatingthetide.com/p/george-atuan-the-dirt-on-a-quiet-compounder-hiding?utm_source=publication-search)). This is the company behind Cat’s Pride litter and a whole bunch of industrial clays. It owns its own clay mines and makes everything from lightweight cat litter to filtration clays used in renewable diesel. 

My thesis then was simple: vertical integration + shift into higher-margin products = rising profitability, but the market hadn’t caught on. 

Earnings had tripled in a few years and the stock was still at single-digit P/E and EV/EBITDA. 

I valued it at $64.

Fast-forward to today. ODC's last earnings were one of the strongest quarters in its 85-year history: Q3 FY2025 revenue $115.5M (+8% y/y), net income $11.6M (+50%), EPS +51%. 

The B2B segment (agricultural carriers + renewable diesel filtration) delivered record sales and margins over 30%. Even with some hiccups in retail cat litter, the overall business is firing on all cylinders.

**B2B Products Group**: Sales +18% to $42.7M, op income +26% to $13.4M (\~31% margin). Ag products hit an all-time high (+43%) as customers worked through last year’s inventories. Fluid purification clays +13% y/y. Even though US renewable diesel production was down 12% early in 2025, ODC’s sales into that sector were up, they’re winning share at new plants. Amlan animal health stayed flat at $5.8M but management is tweaking distribution.

**Retail & Wholesale**: $72.8M sales (+3% y/y) but excluding the Ultra Pet acquisition organic sales were down \~4%. Clay litter fell 6% due to a lost private-label account and some retailer bankruptcies (think regional pet stores closing). Competitors got aggressive on promos. The bright spot is lightweight litter and crystal litter: Cat’s Pride Fresh & Light and the new Cat’s Pride-branded crystals are growing faster than the category. Ultra Pet added \~$4.8M in Q3 sales and ODC has increased the number of retail “doors” for its crystal litter significantly.

Financially, ODC is conservative: cash $36.5M, net debt essentially zero. They’re doubling capex to $32M/year to modernize plants and meet demand. Dividend up 16% (22nd consecutive annual raise). Management thinks in decades, not quarters. The CEO literally said they plan 40 years ahead for raw material reserves.

Industry trends still support them: cat litter demand projected to grow \~5% annually through 2030 with premium subcategories like lightweight and crystals growing faster; renewable diesel capacity in the US keeps expanding and every gallon needs filtration clay; agriculture inputs stable to positive as farm supply inventories normalize.

So why sell? Valuation. 

The “steal” at $43 has been recognized. Multiples moved from <8x earnings to \~13x, EV/EBITDA from <8x to \~11x, P/FCF from 18x to 25x. My updated fair value is $74, so there’s still some upside (\~8%), but the asymmetric risk/reward I look for is gone. I’d rather redeploy the capital into the next underpriced idea than sit on a position where the margin of safety has shrunk.

I’m still a fan of the company and it stays on my watchlist. If Mr. Market throws a tantrum and ODC dips again, I’ll be ready. But for now, discipline > emotion.

Curious what the sub thinks: do you trim or exit when a small-cap rerates quickly? Anyone else follow ODC or other under-the-radar compounders like this?

So right now 100% of my (small) long term portfolio is invested in QQQ. 

I’m considering diversifying  allocating 10 or 20% of my portfolio either to:

* a gold ETF (**GLD, IAU** or **SGOL**) , or
* a global index ETF, such as **URTH**, **ACWI**, or **VEA**.

I’m concerned that all of these assets look pretty overbought at the moment but the plan is to hold this allocation for a decade.

**Question #1:** What would make more sense:

\- To diversify with gold as a hedge, or 

\- To diversify with a world index ETF to balance exposure across regions and sectors. or 

\- To add more into the QQQ

1njdniq,investing,Bubble worries have sparked my interest in a particular bond ETF,"I do not believe in timing the market, but when there are major economic trends brewing, I do try to position myself to take advantage of them, which is why I'm plowing a big chunk of my portfolio into TLT right now.

TLT is an ETF for 20+ year bonds. It has a decent yield, but more importantly, it is very sensitive to interest rate changes. The moves can be pretty dramatic. It's down about 50% since the days of ZIRP. You don't usually think about capital gains when investing in bonds, but TLT is uniquely positioned for gains if the Fed continues to reduce rates.

My thesis for this investment is that we are either stuck in stagflation or we are on the verge of a recession. If we're in stagflation, the yield from TLT will outperform the S&P 500. If we're in a recession, the fed will likely continue to lower interest rates, and TLT will deliver capital gains on top of a yield.

The obvious risk is that we are actually entering a period of sticky inflation and the job market recovers, in which case the Fed will raise interest rates. But this seems like the least likely scenario. Tariffs are expected to create transitory inflation and everywhere you turn there is weak jobs data.

Unless you think I'm underestimating the risk of sticky inflation?",0,8,2025-09-17 13:48:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njdniq/bubble_worries_have_sparked_my_interest_in_a/,2025-09-30 15:06:10.972026

1nj9zwu,investing,How do we feel about ACHR,"Archer Aviation is down about 35% from its highs earlier this year

I’ve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven’t added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I’ve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They’re making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They’re also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they’ve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it’s not a dealbreaker.

The stock’s trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren’t guaranteed.

SP has now reached levels where some long-term investors might start considering adding again, but I’m still on the sidelines.

if demand is truly about to “double,” why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

1niqq2t,investing,Rate my collapse portfolio,"I have a feeling my portfolio is going to make a lot of people mad, but am curious for feedback.

I’ve historically (35 years in 401k) been a pretty modest but aggressive investor, only tweaking my mix every 2-3 years.  At the end of 2024 I moved most of my balance into a self-directed PCRA and into safer investments (mostly international bonds and international index funds).  I shifted a bit more into stocks and precious metals in April and am up about 12% overall YTD.

I’m also a big believer in climate change and in the science behind [The Limits to Growth](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-08-14/which-future/), and all the recent science indicates we’re now experiencing climate change at an exponential rate, which will continue to accelerate.  I think that in the next 5-10 years it will be impossible for people to deny, although some will choose to think of it as biblical end times.  Add in all the predictions of a big economic downturn, I’m ready to lock in on a longer term strategy.  

I’m not savvy enough to know if it’s going to be a recession, depression, stagflation or hyperinflation scenario, but it seems like the Permanent Portfolio strategy has consistently outperformed other portfolios in these types of conditions:

* 25% bonds
* 25% stocks
* 25% cash
* 25% gold

Given my long term outlook for societal collapse by \~2040 (give or take 5 years), and the limitations associated with an employer sponsored account, here are the modifications I’ve made:

**25% bonds (+ bond proxies)**

* 10% in ISGH
* 10% in XLU
* 5% in FPI 

I’m betting on utilities to do well with the change to regs around exporting natural gas, and increasing scarcity in general.  I’d like to be more heavily into farmland, but not super comfortable with any of the REIT’s right now to commit more.

**25% stocks**

* 11% in VYMI & IEUR index funds
* 11% in “collapse” stocks
* 3% in my unicorn stock, ASTS

Collapse stocks include companies in agriscience, fertilizer, firefighting chemicals, air conditioner manufacturers, and some Trump admin-inspired stocks like COIN (holding) and PLTR (just unloaded).  I would love to diversify more in this category, open to suggestions.

**25% cash / 25% gold**

* 10% in a 4% CD, which would cover 8-10 mos of expenses
* 15% in physical gold and silver, the remainder of liquid assets
* 25% in gold and precious metals ETF’s

I will purchase more physical gold/silver and reallocate the funds in ETF’s as able.  My goal is to maintain purchasing power as things continue to unravel.  

Anyone thinking along the same lines?  For those who think my outlook is crazy, how do you think this mix will perform?",0,20,2025-09-16 19:10:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1niqq2t/rate_my_collapse_portfolio/,2025-09-30 15:06:12.865416

1nih5qo,investing,Defying the news: why do prices sometimes move in the opposite direction of the data?,"Sometimes, a much anticipated new release comes out, and the prices go the exact opposite way than you’d expect. 

Today, US Core Retail Sales for August came in at +0.7% MoM - much better than the expected. Logically, stronger consumer spending signals a robust economy, which should boost the USD and in turn push EUR/USD lower.

But this didn’t happen, at least at the time of writing. EUR/USD is still pushing higher, at 1.18100 and testing multi-year highs. 

Why does this happen?

Here are a few key reasons:

- Buy the rumour, sell the news: Markets often price in expectations before the data hits. Traders anticipated solid retail numbers amid ongoing economic optimism, so the ""good"" news was already baked in. Once confirmed, profit-taking kicks in, reversing the trend.

- Overriding Factors: This one is vital to understand: even strong data can get overshadowed by bigger fundamental stories. Right now, the USD is under pressure from expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and this dilutes the USD appeal.

- Technicals and Sentiment: Charts matter. EUR/USD has been in a bullish channel, with support at 1.1760 holding firm. Also, broader risk-on sentiment can trump a single US bit of good news.

- Not All Beats Are Equal: If the data ""beat"" isn't massive, it might not shift the narrative as we may expect. A 0.3% surprise here wasn't enough to derail the dovish Fed story or the general USD down sentiment. 

This is the market's way of reminding us: it's not just about the data released – it's about context and the bigger picture. 

The only remedy: an open mind ready for any outcome, and sound risk management.",0,6,2025-09-16 13:14:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nih5qo/defying_the_news_why_do_prices_sometimes_move_in/,2025-09-30 15:06:12.865475

Their recent promo 25for25 on the surface may seem like a short term money grabber. But it might be a key to long term sustainability/growth. Those of you not familiar with this promo, just take a look at r/jetblue among other flyer forums and you will be surprised how many people are doing it. The gist of the promo is that you fly to 25 destinations by the end of the year and you get x amount of their mileage points and a status with them for next 25 years. Directly, B6 may lose some money on these flyers (the points one earns roughly offset the amount one spends to acquire them). But imagine this. A person who is sitting on these points, and has a status with the airline, is going to do anything in his/her power to fly with them... for next 25 years. Not just them, their companions who may or may not have the status will likely fly with them too. So, I think it may be the thing that helps JetBlue survive. Third and fourth quarter earnings will give us some data to prove/disprove this theory. Thoughts?

1nid949,investing,"AI Enthusiasm in Stocks: Records Despite Yields,Your Offset Pains?","The recent rise in AI stocks, which has reached record highs, feels like a real struggle. On one side, there's great excitement for AI that drives company values up. It resembles a gold rush, as everyone believes they've discovered the next big thing. At the same time, bond yields are rising, which typically makes investors more careful and can cause them to withdraw money from the stock market. This creates a strange mix of optimism and caution.

This situation raises the classic question: is this a true tech revolution or just a bubble waiting to burst? I find that the real challenge of holding these stocks is the wild fluctuations. One day you’re significantly up, and the next you’re down just as much. It's not suitable for the faint of heart.

To handle this kind of volatility, perhaps the strategy isn't to chase the latest trend but to think long-term and diversify. It might be better to find companies that genuinely use AI to address problems, rather than simply riding the hype.

* [**VTI**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vti/) (70%)
* [**VXUS**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vxus/) (30%)

I've considered adding **value**, specifically small-cap value, and **momentum** tilt to my portfolio. Here is my plan:

* **US vs. Non-US** = 60:40
* **Market cap weight (MCW) vs. Factors** = 75:25
* **Value vs. Momentum** = 60:40

I've also been studying most ETFs' methodology, and I like Avantis and Alpha Architect. Here are what I plan to add:

* [**AVUV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avuv/): Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF
* [**AVDV**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/avdv/): Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF
* [**QMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/qmom/): Alpha Architect U.S. Quantitative Momentum ETF
* [**IMOM**](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/imom/): Alpha Architect International Quantitative Momentum ETF

Here is what my equity portfolio would look like with the tilt:

* VTI = 45%
* AVUV = 9%
* QMOM = 6%
* VXUS = 30%
* AVDV = 6%
* IMOM = 4%

Besides the increased rebalancing difficulties and management fee of this new plan, my biggest concern is how much time I need to commit to it. Both [Rick Ferri](https://youtu.be/e7_MFyltNt4?t=415) and Wes Gray agreed that a tilted portfolio may require 25 years of commitment, due to its tracking error. However, in studies, value and momentum have a strong negative correlation, so when both are together, they should help smooth out the performance.

I believe in factor premiums, and I'm confident with this plan. My most considerable doubt is the long-term commitment, which I can't guarantee due to my health condition. My kids may inherit my portfolio once I'm gone, and I assume they might prefer to see some evidence to trust this plan.

I'm looking forward to hearing some feedback about my new portfolio, especially if you have also looked into factor tilting before or have already added one or two factors to your portfolio.

I have no idea what major id switch to but I didn't do grade 12 math cause I didn't need it for the major I'm currently in. This worries me because idk if I'll be able to get into another program and I might need to go to college instead or redo whatever Highschool courses I need to do. 

I was thinking that if I can just find a part time job and drop out of school I'll be able to afford to lose that 6.7k. But I feel like finding a part time job will be insanely hard and probably unlikely due to job shortage.

The thought I have in my head is to just work as much as I can, pay for school after the gap year and invest the rest of the money. I have no expenses since I am lucky enough to live with my parents. 

I have the idea in my head that you can become financially free by just working maybe even average paying job and putting 90% of the salary into investing until my compounding interest is more than my yearly contributions, then buy a small affordable apartment and eventually upgrade to something else and perhaps rent it out for extra income. 

Any tips? Is it unrealistic? Can you get financially free with any job? 

For some reason I'm really worried about my future and confused on what I want to do, but I do know that I want to invest as much money as I can.

That will mean that the odds of a fed rate cut have gone up. Even though the Trump loss on the firing of Cook means that she won't be sidelined, there was really no indication of how she would have voted. On the other hand Miran's opinions on the matter are pretty clear, even if one doesn't think he is a trump lackey. 

However, in both the shorter term and the longer term, it's not clear how things will work out. If the Trump supreme court upholds his right to fire at will which it has done in all the other cases, then he will still be able to stack the deck in short order.

Now I see that practically any investment at that point would had have quite a few gains now. Google was 180, now 250 for example - one of the stocks I would have added. 

At a later date I asked them to sell Vital Farms stock (had a lot of gains in that one) and trade it for Google. They suggested to wait until earnings, and then sell.  After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

I understand brokers work to balance portfolios, and I do give mine the agency needed to make trades without contacting me for each and every one. However, I find this infuriating, seeing the gains that would have been made.

1ni0ifz,investing,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

1nhy2zb,investing,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations — which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change — are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",80,33,2025-09-15 18:24:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,2025-09-30 15:06:12.865666

1nhomjt,investing,LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk high reward biotech company,"Hello r/investing true to my name I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

Again this is high risk and although my name would lead you to believe I only hold small cap. Majority of my own funds are in diversified ETFs.

1nhmcfe,investing,Thinking About Investing in Silver – What’s Your Take?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been looking into silver recently as a potential investment, and I’m curious what the community thinks.

On one hand, it seems like silver has some solid fundamentals:

* It’s both a precious metal and an industrial metal (used in electronics, solar panels, medical tech, etc.).
* Historically, it’s seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* Compared to gold, it looks relatively undervalued right now.

On the other hand:

* Silver can be extremely volatile, sometimes even more than gold.
* Industrial demand could fluctuate depending on the economy.
* It doesn’t provide dividends or yield, so holding it is a pure bet on price appreciation.

I’m wondering: do you guys think silver is a smart play right now? Would you go for physical silver (coins, bars), ETFs, mining stocks, or avoid it altogether?",6,40,2025-09-15 13:48:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhmcfe/thinking_about_investing_in_silver_whats_your_take/,2025-09-30 15:06:12.865754

1nhhdz2,investing,What are the best sectors to invest in in 2025?,"I'm looking at different sectors and industries, and he are my thoughts. Very interested in your feedback. 


IT & industrials
Even if AI will eventually flop, it's still going. However, with Mag7 valuations and EPS projections being far from perfect, I prefer looking at those who sell timber and iron to the shovel makers: COMM, STRL etc. 

Aerospace&Defense look really good considering ongoing conflicts and lack of tariff exposure.

Great sectors overall, but picking is a key. 

Comms
They are beating expectations harder what tech. Some great regional diversification, too, with VEON or IHS.


Materials
Despite a bull market, gold skyrocketed. Most of gold diggers though are still priced like an ounce is worth $2k, despite their margins are wide af. And with growing inflation, crappy bond yields, and high uncertainty, it's hard to imagine what could go wrong for gold. It's literally almost impossible to pick a bad stock there, an average gold stock has made 70% over a year. 


Financials
Banks should benefit from the falling interest rates. BNPL should benefit from this and reducing in consumer buying power. 


Energy
Nuclear is overbought, and oil seems to be on the downward trend, nothing to fish here. 


Consumer Staples
Not a bad choice with purchase power dropping. I really like CALM, for instance


Consumer Discretionary
Not sure I get a point why invest into them. Tech/Comms/Industrials will do better in a bull market, and this sector will be hurt just as much in the bear market. 


Utilities
Kinda same as with energy, I don't see green to be taking cash. I do like SBS though. Maybe hidden tech stocks like VTOL


Healthcare
I don't believe in biotech at large, but some pragmatic things like hospitals or telemedicine could be great


REIT
Nah, not with BBB :)

1nhcsza,investing,"How to begin investing at the peak, quite a bit of global unrest","I am Software Engineer in tech company have been $300k for last 10 years on an average, but never learnt that investing is necessary to preserve wealth. I felt I would quit job in first few years and open a business but never materialized, so I kept living life on autopilot, just doing 9-5. In covid, i started taking interest watching lot of news about stock rocketing. I opened brokerage account and started investing, in doing so sold my employer RSU feeling it'll drop but it only double after I sold. Then to catch up for time lost, I taking big bets, invested 700k in various stocks and SPUS, but in August 2024 when trump announced tarriffs, lost 10% and panicked and sold losing 70k in cash. Then again mustered courage, and invested in Feb 2025, again tarriffs were announced, lost 20k. Then have been away from market ever since.

I also bought house all cash in 2023, as felt i have so much cash why should I do mortgage (also am against borrowing money on interest), but sadly house didn't appreciated, I bought in Austin, rather price dropped from price I bought. I feel as much I chase for parking money watching everyone multiply their savings, more I'm losing money.

Even if I just were to swap to Fidelity from the private investor and put it all in target date funds that would still safely out perform where I stand currently.

1nh8zz6,investing,Housing Market to Crash?  …It’s Complicated.,"Since 2021, I’ve been hearing a lot of talk on a housing market bubble. 

I’m here to say, with incredible confidence, that I’m actually not confident about where housing prices will find themselves in the coming years…at all. BUT I don’t think this disqualifies me from offering some insight for you other brave souls to carry the torch where I’ve stumbled in the dark. 

I built two important models, today, both of which can completely justify the median home price at current interest rates… and argue against it entirely. 

The current market prices seem “allowable” if I’m allowed to assume that the market projects a rate fall from the 6s to the low 3s. Then it makes sense. 
Let’s start with the home values current. Some estimates put median home prices for 2025 around 410k and other are as high as 440k.  I believe Zillow has a figure around 380k. So, for all intents and purposes, I like 410k. 

Whether or not these prices are deeply overpriced really come down to just what the average interest rates should look like over the next 30 years from here. And I did a little ‘mathing’ to prove that.

I regressed the monthly payment per square footage of median-priced homes over the last 30 years. This model assumes a 10% down payment, then incorporates average interest rates of each period to derive monthly payment.. then divides by square footage of median sized home in each year (took forever to find). 

From that trend line, we can see that the market mean for 2025 would have the payment per square ft at 72 cents. 
Converting that into a monthly payment brings us to around $1600/ month for principal and interest. 

All the to say the trend from 1995 to 2025 would reasonably have someone pay that. Given today’s interest rates, that would then price the projected home value for 2025 around 290-300k. 
Now that’s not the national average, is it? 
No. Absolutely not. Should we be upset? Well, hang on..

Here’s why that figure still might be a gross underestimation of how the market ‘should’ price homes: 
It doesn’t factor in the potential for refinancing. 

If the market broadly accepts interest rates to hover around 6-6.5% for the next 30 years, then we would probably see homes take on lower prices. But we haven’t. So somewhere baked in, there must be a presumption of what long term interest will look like moving forward. 

So, I started playing around with the figures and reset the objective of finding what interest rate the market would imply, assuming that the home prices today are priced perfect. 
So I plugged in the median home price today (410k) combined with the market’s regression of monthly payments (normalized to square footage) and got back 3.22%…ish. 

The question from here is, which idea sounds crazier? 
Is it crazier to think interest rates moving outward will effectively be around 3.22%, or is it crazier to think that homes are selling for a 40-45% premium? 

In one world, interest rates would have to be cut in half in the next few years and in another world housing prices would have to either stagnate for a decade or fall by 30% in the next year. 


Now, I understand no model is perfect, and mine is really not factoring in any nuances experienced in this year vs any other, but it certainly stands on principle. That principle is “Something has to give”.

So, what do you think? Are we in a bubble? Have prices climbed with inflation? Can we reasonably expect lower interest rates? Can we expect a major correction?",0,45,2025-09-15 01:37:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nh8zz6/housing_market_to_crash_its_complicated/,2025-09-30 15:06:12.865825

The primary reason shown to reduce interest rate is to boost job market. But the hiring freeze is due to tariffs. So, what motivation is there to lower interest? Maybe to help with the real estate? Houses are not selling in my area, there is no buyer visiting.

1ngn9vo,investing,Will the market face a persistent drag as Boomers begin liquidating 401Ks through retirement?,"I have heard that the average return of the S&P over time is 8% annually.  However, never in our history have we had so much market wealth concentrated among middle to upper-class Boomers, who are going to liquidate their holdings as they go through retirement. This is further exacerbated by the polls showing that many Boomers don't intend to leave wealth for their children.

My question is: will this create a new semi-permanent drag on the market, given the sheer magnitude of the 401K withdrawals? Of course I understand that there are more working-age people adding to the 401Ks than senior citizens pulling money out. However, the withdrawals will end up canceling out a substantial proportion of the investments, from what I understand. And it makes me thing that the 8% average growth will be tough to keep up given that pervasive drag.

1ngal7f,investing,AMZN covered calls free money?!,"We have some vested AMZN RSUs that have been pretty stagnant but I’m bullish on the company and we’re plenty diversified so we’re holding. 




About a month ago I was reading some covered call strategies and AMZN stood out as a decent company to sell covered calls on. So I tried it weekly for the last month, on Friday I’d sell a CC for the next Friday from $130-248 each. After rolling the cost and putting aside some money for the tax man I came out with about $440. That’s just under 2% return for the month. 



If I do this every month and let the cash sit in a money market or reinvest I come out with a pretty healthy profit. Now I just have the 100 shares so it is a bit of effort for just $440/mn but we have more vesting soon and once we get 200-300 shares that’s not bad. 




Here’s where it’s free money:


1. I’ll get this out of the way: I’m completely fine if these get called and I have to sell. It’s been an underperformed and was “free” to begin with. I’m not expecting amzn to have a crazy week and I miss out on a double. 




2. I’ve been selling 232.5 and 235 calls. Amazon has struggled to pass the $240 and only a few times in the last year did it get to $235+ making it fairly unlikely for it then to be called.



3. AMZN shouldn’t have many unexpected upside moves, it’s just not historically likely. Making it somewhat safe. However it does tend to float between $215-230 meaning this should be a fairly sustainable approach for me to keep doing every week or two.




I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious? Like the biggest risks are losing out on future gains of the shares if it gets called and taxes right? But the taxes are factored in and the return is still decent and the future gains I’m just not particularly worried about and it seems I’d be able to buy back in. I’m genuinely open to advice if I’m fucking something up, but I don’t think I am and it seems like a solid strategy.",0,15,2025-09-13 22:25:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ngal7f/amzn_covered_calls_free_money/,2025-09-30 15:06:12.865964
1ng907k,investing,Trying to understand Li Auto stock (why it hasn't gone down more),"Li Auto has had, what looks to me, a terrible trend the past several months. August deliveries were \~40 % down YoY. 2nd quarter results were not as bad as that, but still nothing good. The deliveries for Q2 were only \~2% higher YoY. 4.5 % declined revenue, net income essentially flat.

However, they guided for Q3 deliveries and revenue to decline \~40% YoY!

Finally, their upcoming models don't bode very well, IMO. Their BEV models don't look very interesting aesthetically--in fact, kind of ugly. The upcoming i6 seems to look alright but nothing special. I'm not seeing how they're going to compete well in the extremely competitive Chinese market if Chinese consumers continue shifting to BEVs, and that's the area that Li Auto seems least competitive in. They achieved a lot of growth on hybrids, but their BEV models have been relatively unsuccessful so far. But the future lies in EVs, I think. I don't see how Li's competitiveness is going to improve with boring-looking cars, when Chinese consumers have so many other options to find good value propositions.

So, I don't get it. Why has this stock not collapsed more? It's trading at about the same price as at the end of April. At that time it was delivering \~35k vehicles/month, compared to \~28k in August.

Li Auto themselves predict that their next quarter will be terrible, with 40% YoY declines in deliveries and revenue.

Over the last few decades where the assumption was generally “dollar strong, don’t want foreign currencies dropping to eat the returns of dollars invested internationally” those hedges were essentially a form of downside insurance for exchange rates wiping out returns “from the dollar perspective.”

I admit to a lot of ignorance about how the funds actually implement hedging strategies, but are they bi directional or are they just implemented to insure against downside currency risk from the dollar perspective?  That is, if an international bond paying interest in Euros is hedged now and the dollar is falling, does the hedging effectively make performance worse from the dollar perspective?

1nfwv0f,investing,Your sustainable fund might not be what you think it is,"A massive academic review of sustainable investing research uncovered something concerning: recent studies show many funds labeled as ""sustainable"" or ""ESG"" actually contain companies with significant ESG controversies.

The research analyzed nearly 1,000 papers spanning 35 years and found that while sustainable investing exploded after 2015, the methods for screening companies remain surprisingly primitive. Most research relies on backward-looking data rather than predictive analysis, and there's virtually no use of modern technology to detect or prevent greenwashing.

This matters for individual investors because you might think you're investing ethically while inadvertently funding practices you oppose. The fund labels and ESG ratings we rely on appear to have significant blind spots.

The study suggests we're in the early stages of sustainable investing - like the dial-up era of ESG. The infrastructure for truly effective sustainable screening is still being built.

If you're investing in ESG funds, this research suggests doing additional due diligence beyond just trusting the label or rating. The field is evolving rapidly, but current methods may not be as reliable as they appear.

I’m always tempted to dial my monthly amount down as the price rises, effectively buying fewer ounces over time. However, this feels like market timing based on intuition, which goes against the set-and-forget principle of DCA. Is this a foolish impulse?

Is there a systematic way to approach this, perhaps by adjusting my contribution based on a metric like the 200-day moving average?

1nf46bi,investing,Is Oracle just SoftBank wearing a mask?,"Let me get this straight:

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

So Oracle's stock price is essentially a 3x leveraged bet on SoftBank's ability to fund commitments that exceed their entire balance sheet, while navigating regulatory hurdles, legal challenges, and their own history of spectacular failures?",1408,97,2025-09-12 14:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nf46bi/is_oracle_just_softbank_wearing_a_mask/,2025-09-30 15:06:13.329544

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1ntsp96,stocks,"OpenAI Launching Instant Checkout, Working with Etsy(+16%) and Shopify(+6%), threatening Google(-1.2%) Search's core revenue stream.","https://openai.com/index/buy-it-in-chatgpt/

One common argument on here is that Google's business model is not threatened by OpenAI, because the highest value searches (shopping related ones) are still done through Google, whereas OpenAI is capturing lower value queries.  So while people turn to LLMs for general questions, they still use Google for online shopping and click on sponsored ads. 

Most importantly, online retailers looking to advertise to people that are directly searching for their type of product really only had Google/Yahoo/Bing as an option, and Google had the majority of market share.

Today OpenAI killed this theory. OpenAI is in the process of integrating shopping directly into ChatGPT. It is still in its early stages, right now only supporting Etsy, and will soon rollout to Shopify. These platforms pay OpenAI for driving sales. 

CPC and CPM for Google ads are notoriously expensive, so if this goes well, expect more online retailers to implement deals with OpenAI, and cut Google ad spend as OpenAI drivers higher return on investment and such announcements boost share price. 

This is a much safer form of performance based advertising. Paying per click on Google ads is risky, because a click doesn't guarantee a sale. If OpenAI is charging a fee based on the final sale rather than per click, this makes marketing ROI much easier to predict.",228,114,2025-09-29 20:14:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntsp96/openai_launching_instant_checkout_working_with/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858136

1ntrwnd,stocks,Old Stock Certificates,"My father bought 200 shares of New York Electric and Gas back in 1994. This is a utility operating under a company called Avengrid. Avengrid was acquired by Iberdrola and taken private, and Avengrid shareholders were paid $35.75 per share in 2024.

My question is this… I spoke with a shareholder customer service rep who told me as there had been no activity, the money was turned over to the State of Florida. However, Florida is showing that those 200 shares are only worth $270.00. Is there a reason for this difference?

From my work, I actually have a pulse on how much oil and lumber normally gets sent to the U.S and I can tell you that when the reserves get low oil will serge.

Also let’s say the A.I. Has two big paths either the hype is real and we get Agi or not

In both sides, Commodities will surge, and debt becomes less of an issue. Right now, KOS has a lot of debt, but a weakening currency works in its favor. If A.I. and AGI actually come through, energy will become the new gold like more than actual gold. And yes, eventually renewables like solar will take over, but if you look at what these data centers are and will run on, it’s mostly traditional power.

It’s an actual hedge. Gold’s already priced in the recession panic, but oil? Not even close. Real assets, energy leverage, and upside most people ignore.

The Labor Department is preparing for what would amount to a news and data blackout should the U.S. government suspend operations.

In a contingency plan released Friday, the department said it was looking “to ensure that DOL agencies can perform an orderly suspension of programs and operations should a lapse occur, while continuing those limited activities authorized to continue during a lapse.”


While the department’s scope covers a multitude of areas, the impact on data releases will be pressing for investors. The DOL, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has several key reports upcoming that will provide important clues about the direction of the economy and inform Federal Reserve policymakers ahead of their next meeting in October.

“BLS will suspend all operations,” the 73-page plan stated. “Economic data that are scheduled to be released during the lapse will not be released",1217,182,2025-09-29 16:12:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm8my/labor_department_wont_be_releasing_data_including/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858165

1ntm28y,stocks,WeRide (WRD) - Bet on Robotaxis - DD,"If you are looking to invest in a pure-play robotaxi/autonomous driving tech stock with blockbuster revenue growth and major global partnerships, you should seriously consider going all in on WRD. The recent quarter’s results and newsflow have been very positive: 

WRD tripled its Abu Dhabi robotaxi fleet, launched Saudi’s first service, secured permits in Dubai, Singapore, Belgium, and even made Fortune’s Change-the-World list. Some key facts:

# Let's see the recent Analyst sentiments:

* Citigroup (Sep 29, 2025): Initiated WRD coverage with a **Buy** rating and $15.50 price target.
* UBS (Aug 4, 2025): Initiated coverage with a **Buy** and $12.00 target.
* JPM: Initiated coverage orginally at \~$23 earlier this year but move it down to about 13 (still 30% upside from today
* s price)
* Consensus: Average 12-month price target \~$16.32, implying \~88% upside over current levels.

# Recent Earnings & Growth (Q2 2025)

* Revenue: RMB127.2M (US$17.8M) in Q2’25, **+60.8% YoY**.
* Robotaxi revenue: RMB45.9M (US$6.4M), **+837% YoY**, now **36.1% of total revenue**.
* Gross Profit: RMB35.7M (US$5.0M), **+40.6% YoY**, with gross margin **28.1%**.
* R&D/OpEx: Rapidly expanding (Q2 op-exp +42.5% to RMB487.8M) as WeRide scales globally.
* Net loss: RMB406.4M; management views spend as investment in future profitability.
* CEO/CFO: Emphasized robotaxi growth is now *core* to revenues; operations scaling globally is “at an inflection point” toward profitability.

# Robotaxi & AV Partnerships (Tech Exposure)

WeRide’s whole thesis is scaling Level-4 autonomous taxis/shuttles worldwide, with major partnerships and pilots on 4 continents:

* **Middle East (Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Dubai)**: Largest public AV fleets outside the US/China. Tripled Abu Dhabi fleet, first Saudi L4 taxi permit, rides linked with Uber. Middle East fleet aims for 1,000 vehicles by 2030.
* **China (Shanghai)**: Launched L4 robotaxis with Chery Group and Jinjiang taxi firm; co-developed new EV “CER” model.
* **Southeast Asia (Singapore)**: Grab invested in WeRide; first fully driverless robotaxi service planned with thousands of AVs in SEA.
* **Europe (France, Belgium)**: Partnered with Renault for L4 robo-shuttles, pilot programs in Belgium and France.
* **Tech**: HPC 3.0 computing unit cuts AV compute cost \~50%, giving WeRide an edge.
* **Permits**: Holds L4 AV licenses in 7 markets (China, UAE, Singapore, France, Saudi, Belgium, US), more than any peer.

# Key Metrics & Valuation

* Market Cap: \~$2.9B.
* FY2024 Revenue: \~$50.2M; 2Q’25 alone $17.8M.
* Ownership: Founders hold \~4.8% each; corporate backers include SoftBank/Alliance Ventures and Zhengzhou Yutong. Top 25 holders own \~44%.
* Profitability: Unprofitable (2Q’25 net loss \~RMB406M), EPS deeply negative. Cash burn focused on R&D and expansion.
* Guidance: Ambition to scale to “thousands” of robo-vehicles by 2026.
* Analyst Outlook: Average 12-month price target \~$16.3, reflecting strong confidence in growth.

# Recent News & Catalysts

* **Belgium L4 Permit**: First-ever Belgian Level-4 test license for EZ10 Robobus in Leuven.
* **Dubai License**: Robotaxi trial permit; initial 50 GXR robotaxis, scaling to \~1,000 vehicles.
* **Grab Investment**: Strategic equity investment; L4 robotaxis to deploy across Southeast Asia.
* **Index & PR Wins**: Added to Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index; featured on Fortune’s 2025 Change the World list.
* **Saudi Launch**: First public robotaxi pilot in Riyadh with Uber.

**What to watch next:**

* Revenue growth in Robotaxi business.
* New regulatory permits
* Partnerships with the big guys (Uber, NVDA)
* Buybacks

**Bottom line:** While there are valuation concerns due to high multiples, WeRide is unprofitable **but** growing explosively. The Q2 beat, positive analyst coverage, and pipeline of high-profile deployments make a bullish thesis. With a \~$2.9B market cap and small revenue base, the unique global footprint – 30+ cities, dozens of AV permits, and strong industry backing, I see massive growth potential. Catalysts like EU/ME rollouts, index inclusion, and continued robotaxi scaling could drive the stock if execution stays on track.",8,2,2025-09-29 16:05:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntm28y/weride_wrd_bet_on_robotaxis_dd/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858186
1ntjtyt,stocks,Don't be afraid to miss the opportunity. You can't!,"We're in a situation where the stock market is inflated with worthless companies valued in billions - all because people want to buy the next Apple, Nvidia, or Google. Here's my point: you can't miss the next big thing. Successful businesses don't appear and disappear overnight. Their success is a story that lasts for decades. Look:

In 2005, Google was already a business with world-class infrastructure - from their exceptional search and ads engine to tools like Gmail, Maps, Images, and more. Guess what? 2005 was just the beginning of Google's journey.

In 2010, Apple had multiple successes with their products - from the Apple I to the Macintosh, iPod, and iPhone. Think it was late? In 2010, the stock was priced at less than $10.

In 2015, Nvidia was already a successful company loved by gamers, CG artists, and researchers. Their products were exceptional; everyone wanted the latest GeForce GPU in their setup. You'd think 2015 was definitely too late? Ha!

See the pattern? Those stories show that a great business provides a window of buying opportunity measured in years, if not decades. Look at the greatest businesses and see how this pattern holds. FOMO is a lie! You have plenty of time to do your research and enter.

What I'm showing is how great businesses are picked: they change the world with their innovation. No need for empty words and marketing campaigns when you can witness the impact yourself, without a middleman.

A great business would tell you, in a confident voice: ""Don't be afraid. Do your research, take your time. Even after five years, we'll remain a great opportunity."" A scam business sells you an beautiful narrative, plays with your emotions, and gaslights you into buying their asset with the confidence of a professional narcissist.

Remember, 99% of start-ups fail even if at some point their stock price rise 10x in short amount of time. That means if you don't do your research and all you read is headlines and biased statements made by insiders, you have a 99% chance of losing your money. Eloquent words != an eloquent business model. Short term gain != long term success.  

Today's ""investors"" buy garbage businesses with questionable products (some don't even have products), all because management is big on words, selling ""we are the future"" story. Really? Then prove it first - in action. 

AI, Quantum, Energy, EV... there is always a next big thing screaming from all the corners ""Choose me!"". Before buying, ask this: ""Are you a great businesses? Have you demonstrated your excellence multiple times over the years? Can I witness the impact you make without a middleman's words?"" 

FOMO takes away your ability to analyse and think; it gaslights you with terms such as ""FUD"". A good investment withstands criticism and doubt. Lies needs to be loud because they're lies. Truth is truth no matter what - it doesn't care to shout.",0,17,2025-09-29 14:41:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntjtyt/dont_be_afraid_to_miss_the_opportunity_you_cant/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858190

1ntg57l,stocks,Auto Parts Manufacturer Bankruptcy:  Impact on the parts retailers?,"First Brands filed for bankruptcy this morning and has major customer concentration in retailers like Autozone, O'Reilly, NAPA and similar.  The company would continue supplying parts, but what happens in the medium to long term with retailers when a major supplier falls down?   I assume that costs can go up as they seek wider sources of supply for their privately branded parts.   Any hiccup in metrics for these high valuation companies could at least be a set-back to their stock prices.

O'Reilly, for example trades at a steep PE multiple (38x last year's earnings) and achieved a $90 billion market cap last week (more than Target and Best Buy combined, and much more than either Ford or GM).   

Over time, these retailers have been borrowing ever larger amounts of money to buy back their shares, boosting their earnings per share figures.   Yet, their operating income (up 18%) is only growing at the rate of CPI inflation (15% since 2021), despite adding many new store outlets.   On average, O'Reilly has grown operating income per store only about 3% over four years which is way below inflation.  

I am betting those PE multiples will come down.   Even going from 38 down to 30 would be near-term hit to stock price.",10,9,2025-09-29 12:03:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ntg57l/auto_parts_manufacturer_bankruptcy_impact_on_the/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858215

1nt6p0a,stocks,I am shorting UNH - Very High Quality Analysis,"I wrote everything myself and did not use AI. Images are not allowed here so please refer to the same post on other subs for attached screenshots of my analysis.

Alright guys, this is me going against the entire reddit world as you’ve probably seen everyone on reddit going long on UNH (including myself earlier this year where I made some really good profits on both stocks and options). I closed all my UNH positions this week.

 

And before I get into my short thesis, I’d like to get into why I bought this company in the first place. Because I am not shorting this stock because it is a bad company (To the contrary, UNH actually has a very smart business model and is a big moat business). **I am shorting because** I believe the market isn’t seeing several structural risks that could break the fundamentals in 2026.

 

**Why I went long earlier this year**:

I’ll admit, I didn’t really do a “proper” DD on this stock when I bought. I listened to the “Business Breakdown” podcast on Spotify where a UK fund manager explained why UNH is more than just a managed care company.

A few points she said that made me buy:

\- It’s a health data company with all the information in the world – kinda like the Google of healthcare (huge moat for UNH in terms of pricing & cost savings)

\- Health insurance isn’t long term (such as life insurance), so they can re-price their books in \~1+ years if they made a mistake (they have room to make mistake & fix quickly)

\- Health insurance can only earn up to \~15% from government rules (operating margin goes much lower than that as the 15% is the most), but Optum health expands their margin from Value based care: doctors get paid a fee to keep patients healthy, if patient cost is less than fees, they keep all the remaining as profit.

Value based care offers high quality service and can help patients prevent being hospitalized. This reduces insurance cost (patients who get hospitalized tend to cost significantly more vs preventative care)

\- The vertical integration between health care financer and healthcare provider is a gigantic moat & this idea just sounded smart af.

This sounded very much like a buffet-style business at the time, so I just had to look at valuations.

At the time, I did a quick valuation using the 5-year historic Operating Cashflow & CapEx growth rates to project a 5-year DCF. I did a bear, base, bull case FCF exit multiples of 10x, 15x, 20x (pretty modest). With a WACC of 7.35%, my target prices were $236 (bear), $337 (base), and $438 (bull).

 

 

**Bear thesis**:

If you looked at my valuation DCF above, you’d know that I made a good profit on UNH. The UNH market price has even climbed higher than my base-case target price of $337.

But here is the issue with my DCF, I assumed everything will carry on as it did in the past and the company will continue to grow in the same rate of growth. I also assumed the market will not further compress the multiples which are key to the valuation. And that is the core of my bear thesis:

***UNH has fundamental cracks on Optum, and they will have a very difficult time in 2026 + I think UNH is & has tried to hide it.***

The very fact that the market is going towards my earlier DCF makes me believe the market isn’t pricing in this risk. In fact, the market expanded UNH’s multiple from the Berkshire news (which I will get into later).

 

**What makes the stock price go up?**

From my bull thesis above, you could probably figure out Optum health is where the money is at – and this is what moves the needle (what ultimately makes the stock go up).

But how does this reflect on fundamentals? Let me briefly summarize what UNH is:

**UnitedHealth - What is it - It’s a 2-part business (numbers mostly from 2024 10k, screenshot of my excel attached below)**

 

**1. United Healthcare (\~40% of Revenue) – Insurance provider**

**- Employer & Individual (\~25% of healthcare revenue):** For corporations who pays for health insurance. The employer either pay a monthly premium (UNH takes the risk of claims cost) or employers pays a fixed fee for UNH to administer the health service search (UNH bears no risk).

**- Medicare & Retirement (\~50% of healthcare revenue):** For old people above age 65. Government pays a fixed fee per patient every month.

**- Community & State (\~24% of healthcare revenue):** For Medicaid, aka poor people, the state/community pays a fixed fee per month.

 

**2. Optum (\~60% of Revenue) – Healthcare provider**

**- Optum Health (\~40% of revenue):** Provides the patient care & financial services.

**- Optum Insight (\~10% of revenue):** The data & analytics business.

**-  Optum RX (\~50% of revenue):** Pharmacy care services.

(These numbers are from 10k from 2024 and 2021)

 

In short: The 2 biggest parts of UNH’s revenue are Medicare Advantage and Optum Health.

Medicare certainly moves the needle as it’s a big reason why the stock sold off this year. This is due to elevated medical claim amount /or increasing medical loss ratio for UNH - basically, old people are catching up on their knee-replacement surgeries after the COVID lockdown + playing too much pickle ball.

But for UNH, Optum Health plays an even larger role (also Medicare is the largest component of Optum Health so they add up). Not just because it brings in the most amount of revenue, but because it’s the actual growth engine for the company. If you look at UNH a decade ago, United Health (the insurance wing) was 90% of the business and Optum was only 10%. Now the roles have reversed, UNH is more Optum than insurance. As we’ve mentioned earlier, Optum helps UNH expand their margins through value-based care.

**Look at the period from 2020 – 2024**:

Optum revenue annual growth: \~13.16% vs \~8% for healthcare (it’s really \~4% if you net out eliminations)

Optum Operating Margin: \~8% vs \~5.5% for healthcare

Optum Operating income growth: \~11%+ vs \~4.75% for healthcare (yeah it grows more than double the rate of healthcare)

UNH Stock price: More than doubled in the same period. (if you count trough to peak prices: $230.1 to $630.73 that’s a 174% gain)

This isn’t the kind of stock price growth you would expect from a mature stage health insurance company growing in the single digits. This is your typical growth company with a growing topline + margin expansion (aka Optum)

 

**What did the market price in already?**

Yes. the stock price had dropped from the peak of around $600 to the mid $200s and has since rebounded to the mid $300s. It is still “cheap” when compared to previous highs. It is obvious that the market has absorbed some bad outlooks for the company. But is it really cheap?

I’ve listed out a few main things the market has priced in (up until the most recent Q2):

Optum long-term margin:

\- Earnings were $6.6 billon below management expectation in q2

\- Operating margin for the full year is guided to be 1%.

\- Management further revised down the long-term margin outlook for Optum to be 6% - 8% (from 8 - 10%).

Medical cost surge:

\- Total unexpected medical cost impact of $6.5 billion (this is a short-tail risk as they can reprice this next year)

\- Medicare advantage cost trend is more than expected (utilization of 7.5% vs 5% previously): I mean, this doesn’t add up here. Management’s Q2 earnings call said they’ve been cutting back on benefits, but they still see a growth in utilization? I think UNH has been easing claims approval due to societal pressure. (maybe this part hasn’t been priced in yet as the Medicare cost headwind will be a persistent issue from here).

\- Behavioural health in Medicaid: 20% cost growth (margins are f\*cked here as margin compression is baked into guidance in q2)

Change Healthcare

\- They suffered from a cyber-attack in early 2024 and Optum Insight is still trying to recover from this.

V28 risk model adjustment

\- I will get into the details of V28 below: Currently management said there will be $11 billion headwind over 3 years, and we have $4 billion more to go for 2026.

\- Management said they will get rid of unprofitable clients + increase price + cut cost to offset half of the $4 billion headwind in 2026. (I doubt this and will get into it below)

 

Smart Money (Berkshire Hathaway)

\-  Its kinda hard not to hit the buy button when you see the GOAT of value investing put his own money in this company.

\- My only commentary for this is: 1) Berkshire didn’t put a lot of money in it. 2) they bought before q2 earnings came out (as we are seeing more structural breakdown in q2).

 

**So, what isn’t priced in?**

**1. V28 risk model Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) Risk Adjustment Model (there is more to it…)**

Basically, this risk model is how Optum’s value-based care business gets paid.

For example, a normal patient is $1000 a month. But if this patient has a heart condition, then this HCC risk model gives him a coefficient of maybe 1.5. All of a sudden, this patient will get 1.5 x $1,000 = $1,500 a month.

Before V28, UNH has been able to kind of skirt this system by aggressively diagnosing and applying elevated coefficients to get paid more.

For evidence, let’s look at DaVita Medical Group, which UnitedHealth’s Optum acquired in 2019. On a 5-year trend analysis, the risk coding jumped from 1.01x pre-acquisition to 1.5x post-acquisition. If this isn’t aggressive, I don’t know what is!

So, what did V28 do? In plain English, it’s stricter and UNH can no longer code aggressively (they got rid of 2000 diagnostic categories and flattened the weighting for some conditions – less room for a doctor to say: this guy has diabetes, and I think it’s severe, let’s give him a 2.0 instead of 1.5).

On top of that, UNH employs 10% of doctors in the U.S and with the pricing pressure + more utilization rate (aka. Old people visiting more often), I just don’t buy what management was saying (they can offset 50% of the V28 headwind next year by ‘cost savings’). I think Optum margins will be negative in 2026 and be lower than 5 - 7% long-term. And this is the structural risk to the fundamentals.

 

**2. Shady Accounting Treatment**

**a. Selling a part of their Optum business and using gains as operating income**

Considering UNH’s entire $5 billion of Optum’s operating earnings growth for 2024 came from this ‘gain on sales,’ this certainly isn’t a good look for UNH. And guess what, they have been doing this in both 2024 and 2025.

It also makes me wonder why? My thesis is that if you look at the V28 risk model revision headwind total of $11 billion over 3 years, it’s around $3 billion a year. So maybe they are using this as offset for this headwind. But regardless, they have been shady with accounting, and I think there is more to this.

*(From the 2024 10k – MD&A section*)

To add, they’ve decided to stop this in q2 this year, resulting in a $2 billion loss for Optum earnings. This means 2 things: 1) they’ve been doing this for over a year and a half; 2) They were gonna fill $2 billion of financials holes doing the same thing but just decided to stop.

(from the 2025 q2 earnings call transcript)

 

**b. Use intercompany transactions to inflate segment profitability**

While this isn’t 100% confirmed, certain industry contacts have indicated that Optum is selling services to the United Healthcare side for much more than the market price. They do this to inflate the profitability of Optum (this information is taken from Baird analyst Michael Ha’s interview video with Steve Eisman).

From a simple google search, I can also find similar headlines where UNH is upselling internally.

From reading the 2024 10k myself, I am also a bit confused at the “elimination” line in the income statement from MD&A (it’s basically the transaction between Optum and Healthcare, but since there is another line called “Optum Elimination,” this line is for the Healthcare segment). They only net out this amount in the consolidated revenue amount. However, if we take a look at the UnitedHealthcare revenue by business on page 29, they did not net out the ‘eliminations’ at all. This makes the story much more believable.

 

(from 2024 10k, yeah, they didn’t net out eliminations)

 

**Valuation + Price Target**

My new assumptions (that isn’t even too pessimistic):

Operating cashflow stays flat for 2025 & 2026 and resumes a 1% growth from 2027 to 2029.

CapEx grows at the same 5-year CAGR historical rate (assuming they need to maintain their business).

And the reason why my assumptions aren’t too pessimistic is because my 2025 FCF is $20 billion (much higher than management’s Q2 guidance of $16 billion). They also didn’t mention any plans regarding CapEx but I am being more than generous to maintain historical growth rate as they definitely will need more CapEx to maintain (given their elevated utilization rate – rumor has it that UNH has been easing the claims approval process due to public pressure. Otherwise, this story won’t add up cuz their benefits are less rich compared to national average).

 

(source: my shitty excel sheet)

**Target price**: I think we can at least see the low $200s (maybe even lower) if my thesis plays out. But I’ll start to take profit once we get below $ 250 by selling some poor-man-covered-puts. I will get into details on my executions below.

 

**Shorting Strategy, Position, and Execution Plans:**

**Strategy**: Synthetic Short (kinda) with a long call to cap my loss:

 Sell 300/350 Dec 2027 Credit Call Spread + Buy 300 Jan 2028 LEAPS Put

**Position**:

 

Premium from Call Spread: $9,794.8 - $7,461.25 = $2,333.55

Debit for LEAPS Put: ($4,105.2)

Net Debit: ($1,771.65)

Max Loss Possible: $5,000 + $4,105.2 - $2,333.55 = $6,771.65

 

**Execution Plan**:

**Take profit**: If we drop below \~$250, I will start selling 30 DTE puts and close my call spread position to de-risk. I will fully exit my positions once we drop below $200 or my thesis has played out where Optum blows up.

**Stop loss**: I will hold till early 2027 and see if my thesis has played about/hasn’t played out/has yet to play out. I will hold up to the 45 DTE point and exit regardless.

 

**Conclusion**: I think this company is a short because the story isn’t over yet. Not because UNH a bad company, but because the structural cracks (Optum: V28 + Shady Accounting + Optum margin reset) aren’t fully priced in yet and people are already celebrating on the Berkshire bandwagon.",0,31,2025-09-29 02:32:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nt6p0a/i_am_shorting_unh_very_high_quality_analysis/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858293

1nso3q8,stocks,Wash Sales are Confusing,"Wash sales are a conundrum.
Wash sales are an oxymoron.
Wash sales are a black hole.
Wash sales are damnable. 

Let me explain. I’m considered the pattern day trader by my broker, interactive brokers. I am not one of those day traders that has five screens constantly trading five stocks at a time. I am a day trader that quite often just trade off my cell phone and I usually concentrate on one stock. Most recently it has been NVDA. I can assure you I’m not getting rich, there is no yacht in my future. I have no problem selling the stock for a total of five dollars profit. My goal is not to get rich,  just to give me something to do since I’ve retired. I recently ran across something that I have never seen nor did I know it was occurring. And that is an aspect of wash sales that I did not know was happening. Believe me when I tell you I understand wash sales since Scott trade shut down my trading for three days one time.

I have recently started trading a new stock and in seven days and over 50 trades I only had one loss- that  of a single  dollar. I have made a little  money off this stock. So I was surprised when interactive brokers raised my average price per share on a subsequent purchase  since I have incurred so little losses (a total of -$1 over 50 trades).

For those of you, like me who thought wash sale (or losses) were based on the total trade and not each individual trade you are wrong. It is enlightening. Let’s look at an example. 

The ABC corporation pays a good dividend and the stock price is pretty much range bound at $90 a share. But a rumor has surfaced that the ABC corporation will win a big contract and the share price goes up to $100 a share, you thinking if it’s true it will go higher so you buy one share at $100. Turns out the rumor is false and the share price drops to $80 a share. You knowing it is a $90 share company buy one share at $80. You now hold two shares with an average price of $90 a share. You sell your two shares at $91 per share and pocket two dollars. The price then drops to $70 a share. You realize this is just an over reaction to the loss of a potential contract and you buy one share at $70. But interactive brokers will reflect your average price per that one share at not $70 but at $79.  Because what I didn’t know was when I sold it at $91, I incurred a wash sale from where I purchased it from $100 and sold it at $91. I always thought the wash sale was based on the total sale and not each individual purchase. So when I sell my one share at $90 that I purchased at $70 interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11 ($90-$79). But this is a mirage.  It is an illusion. If you go check your realized gains interactive brokers will reflect a profit of $11. YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WILL ALSO REFLECT A PROFIT OF $11. This is for tax purposes only. If you go look at your cash report, according to interactive brokers, it will reflect a gain of $20. So those of you who are basing their profits off of a realized gain report it is not a true reflection of your actual trading.",0,20,2025-09-28 13:17:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nso3q8/wash_sales_are_confusing/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858329

1ns965v,stocks,"I would like to invest in Gold, Cooper and maybe Oil.","Hi everyone,

I'm french and watched some economic/financial tv shows. They are talking more and mora about metals and oil.

Yesterday, a financial analyst says 6 millions ton of cooper will miss in the next years. The main reason is typically the industrial sector need more and more, and the reserve are emptier and emptier. So maybe I wonder it's the best time to invest in a good mine company to enjoy the futur strong demand.

About gold, they expected the price will keep on rising strongly because the weakess of dollars and the currency policy of asian country (like the new habits of people) will push the demand. I've just sold Genesis Minerals, that looks a beautiful gold mines, but I needed some cash for another investment. Today, it's tricky to find a good point because too much vol.

Oil : It's tricky. One of them said it's a big time to invest in oil. The reserves look weak, and big oil companies tries to find more and more new reserve. But, the main of analyst said it's not a good move because today, every actor (included investment sector) bet on green energy and are not convinced oil will get a good bet on the next 5 years.

1nrqj71,stocks,"Railroads magnates, what do you think of the 85bln $ merger between UNP and NSC merger?","TLDR: Railroad haven’t performed very well in the past years but may still be a solid investment. Do you think the UNP/NSC merger will be value accretive, or are you worried about the price (as a UNP shareholder) and the additional debt of the combined entity?

Railroads have been by far my worse performing investment. I predicted more industrial integration between US, Canada and Mexico and an increase in trade, but boy was I wrong. In addition, I think the economic landscape is shifting to less higher quality products and software, so the volume of goods transported might increase at a slower pace than it has in the last decade (think cars sales for example). Also Business to consumer has lower margins and higher costs.

Still railroads have their infrastructure in place, are clearly cashflow positive, and pay a small dividend every year and buy back a few shares every quarter, so I don’t think they will lose lots of money long term.

Honestly, I am not a fan of NCS reliance on coal (although this administration doesn’t hate the product), and I am a bit concerned of the additional debt taken over by UNP, as well as the 27% share dilution.

However, the management is unlikely to bankrupt such a profitable company, and I can only see advantages owning such a big chunk of US commercial rail long term, at least for shareholders with a massive time horizon.

1nrc9au,stocks,Ramaco Resources METC and METCB,"Ramaco Resources is a metalurgical coal mining company that is developing rare earth minerals which have been found in softer clay strata located above and below the seams. Excitement over their rare earth potential is driving high interest in their stock, but mainly class A, $METC. Recent analyst forecasts for METC are $42 and $45. So, there's good potential for return beyond the current price of $31.

But here's the intriguing thing, class B stock is the tracking stock for the rare earth minerals. It will get 20% of the income generated by the rare earths, plus a coal fee per ton and royalty fees. There is currently 
10.84 million shares B extent and 55.18 million shares class A, putting class B at 16.4% of the total. So it certainly seems the better of the two, but class B ($METCB). is currently trading at a 50% discount to class B. 

I own some class B shares and so far, every time I compare dividends with class A, it's been better. Class B should never be worth more than A because the company has the right to convert them back to class A. But class B has the same asset claims as class A. 

This continues to amaze me and I keep coming back to see if there's anything I'm missing, so would really appreciate any insights you might have.

1nr23ui,stocks,"More Losses, More Liquidity: Who Really Wins Without PDT.","This legislation is just going to be a liquidity injection, more money for the brokers, more money for the Institutions and Market Makers. **Less for Retail.**

It’s a short term illusion of benefit to small players which always benefits institutions; a very common pattern in legislation. It’s never for you.  
Trading influencers will also love it.  
I’m not being cynical, I’m telling you how it is. Lobbyists influence the call.

Undercapitalised new traders will have a more accessible avenue to lose money. All this is, is a smoke screen to further enrich institutions. This post adresses key nuances in the arguement for and against PDT’s removal.

# Here’s my main point:

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new) and the social-media influenced.

**The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.**

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/kcs82kp7lirf1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=c91d791d95838ed0c5f53d63cdb09b3011823e85)

# Addressing Surface-Level Nuances

A trader had said,  
“People, like myself, could do small account challenges with only a few thousand and not be limited to PDT.”

This is very much like gambling with a bankroll in a less complex market.  
Margin trading stocks instead of options (which didn’t have a PDT rule).

This trader had also said,  
“There are tons of people in my circle who trade with both a full time job, family, and school. That has absolutely nothing to do with it. They trade just as successfully as others.”

For those thinking similarly, don’t let survivorship bias cloud your judgement. Profitability is different from sustained profitability. For now they are. **Check Figure 1.**

# Nuance 1: The Main Narrative 

“What you're not seeing, which is obvious is that by removing PDT rule, traders under 25,000 are no longer pressured to get a win on each trade.”

I get your point and understand it fully, but this is a deterrent to not margin trade stocks if a trader is undercapitalised. This stops people from margin trading stocks (trading with leverage). They can do whatever they want on a cash account with or without PDT; it’s a smoke screen so the decision can be justified to sceptics.

# Nuance 2: PDT doesn’t save people from giving their money to the market.

Here’s an example: Cigarettes are harmful but we should allow people to smoke, sure. But should we make it more accessible? Does it benefit the smoker or the tabacco industry more? Tabacco.

It’s like that with removal of PDT people will still trade, it just accelerates the losses and inflates undercapitalised retail participation.

**Margin trading is a choice, and PDT only restricts margin accounts.**

The point is this legislation will have a net negative outcome for retail. If you combine (all net trader P&L)/NumberOfTraders, it’ll be negative. Influencers and institutions will benefit. Not retail.

# Nuance 3: Should people who don’t have 25k to avoid PDT not trade?

That’s not what I said. If anything, I suggested that people who don’t have the time to trade consistently or aren’t rigorous enough with their trading are more likely to lose money.

I do this for a living and know what it takes. It’s not about capital; it’s about knowledge, effort and experience.

A lot of new retail traders avoid options because of the perceived complexity; a lot avoid futures because they don’t understand those derivatives either, and a lot have avoided day trading stocks because of the PDT rule. If these same people can’t find a solution to counter it before the legislation, they likely won’t put in the required work to have sustained profitability.

The same type of people who won’t put in the required work will be able to proceed with margin trading stocks when they shouldn’t. The newcomers, tryouts (both old and new), and the social-media-influenced.

# Nuance 4: most traders lose money so it's better to lose 2000 than lose 25000

If a Retail trader’s balance drops below 25000, the PDT rule kicks in.

**Nuance 4.1: Removal of PDT will be great and remove barriers to entry on the same playing field. PDT Removal will be the best thing to happen in retail stocks**

The points and statistics I’ve cited still apply; it’s financially better for market makers, institutions and brokers but not for retail traders

It’s an overwhelming net negative for the retail investor's pocket. whilst enriching institutions.

**Nuance 4.2: many new traders will have opportunities to grow in ways that wasn’t possible under the old rule**

Few out of many; for most (over 85%), it will be another opportunity to lose money quickly in a more accessible way.

It’s an illusion of freedom because margin trading stocks is an optional thing, and it’s a credit facility that’s offered to the retail trader to increase their risk.

The PDT rule was a limitation on how they could access the credit facility if undercapitalised; it was not about restricting freedoms.

In the 1920s, people were margin trading stocks whether they were average guy or institutional.

People got liquidated, and suddenly you have the Great Depression as a consequence. You need to understand these measures have effects that can cascade into something brutal for everyone.

**Nuance 4.3: It's 2025, not the 1920s, anymore.**

I get your point, but markets have operated in the same way for hundreds of years: supply and demand. Margin has also existed for hundreds of years. It’s nothing new.

# Nuance 5: AI screeners and other tools became more common. It's easier to identify winning stocks now!

This isn’t true and it’s a short term anecdotes don’t hold weight and trend that will be corrected by market algorithms. You need to realise that over the strategies over the medium term can have the illusion of being profitable.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/w12ck7smlirf1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcbcf9a25a68820909b33f246bd1b9ad4e43176)

# Nuance 6: Far more people agree that this change is better than not changing it

This doesn’t mean it’s in your best interest. It’s marketed that way. There should be no appeal to emotion; this should be a redundant factor.

Everything in markets is mathematics and statistics. I’ve read several research papers and over a dozen books. Look at fund managers, practitioners (prop guys), quants, and portfolio managers; they all take it into account, and every profitable trader I’ve communicated with who can present trading statements to prove it takes them into account.

# Nuance 7: You're looking at the negative; it's true you could accelerate losses just as it is as true as you could accelerate winning.

Most traders lose money; that’s a fact, regardless of the exchange. I’m not looking at just the negative; I acknowledge there’ll be winners too. Just very few. Most that win will lose everything they make and/or more due to human psychology, the sunk cost fallacy and other factors.

**Nuance 7.1 It's 2025; we have access to information unlike any other time period in the history of stock trading.**  
That just makes the market more efficient/random this makes market movements harder to predict and profit

**Nuance 7.2 You can look at statistics, but these statistics are based on the 25,000 PDT Rule.**

Most retail traders, over 85%, lose money (according to ESMA, the most generous value), and over long timescales, \~98% lose money. Removal of PDT will increase the number of people margin trading (trading with leverage), which will increase the number of losses and liquidations.

# Ending / Agenda

For transparency: I don’t trade US equities, and I am a UK-based trader; think of me as playing the devil’s advocate.

**If you don’t trade stocks, why bother debating this?**  
I have experience in trading US equities, but I don’t currently trade them; I trade futures and CFDs.

I posted this because I want traders to understand that these legislative changes are rarely in their best interest.  
**Lobbyists make the call.**

The company is set to control 2,910 megawatts of power: more than the Hoover Dam. Power is the bottleneck for AI growth, and IREN has one of the largest low-cost supplies in the market.

At roughly $1.5M profit per MW per year, that’s about $4.4B in annual cash flow. Similar data centers trade at 20–25x, which implies an $83B equity value versus today’s $13B market cap.

On top of that, IREN plans to become its own Cloud Services Provider, which could make it the largest AI datacenter company in the world.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nqvlg8,stocks,Help understanding Hedged vs Unhedged ETFs - Long term (10Y+),"I am new to the stock market (30M), and I want to try to understand the Hedged vs Unhedged ETFs. I am Europe, but I want to invest into Nasdaq 100 by buying iShares ETFs.

iShares NQSE - ISIN [IE00BYVQ9F29](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BYVQ9F29#overview) \- TER 0.33% (Hedged) - 1.633m EUR

My understanding is that Hedged indexes protects from currency fluctuations in my case EUR-USD, but with some extra TER cost, in this example 0.03%

Am i wrong in thinking that the extra 0.03% (i know it is compounded over time) is worth the spent to protect from the currency fluctuations? I am not experienced enough to understand Forex and this is why I prefer to play it a little safer. Am I wrong in thinking that?

Also, the NQSE is 10x smaller (hedged - i know it is newer as well), is that because people prefer to get a riskier ETF (SXRV unhedged) that will generate more profit if the EUR will get weaker than USD?

Is the unhedged like investing in both the stocks themselves and forex while hedged is just the stocks?

Which ones do you prefer for long term?

With construction underway coast-to-coast, Lumen is moving forward a multi-billion-dollar build with plans to add 34 million new intercity fiber miles by the end of 2028, for a total of 47 million intercity fiber miles. The company has already delivered millions of new fiber miles, network capacity upgrades and high-speed connectivity enhancements in 2025, building the network infrastructure enterprises need to power their AI workloads.

“AI is fueling a surge in network demand like we’ve never seen, and Lumen is building the backbone to meet it,” said Kye Prigg, executive vice president, enterprise operations, Lumen Technologies. ""This isn’t incremental – we plan to more than double the size of our U.S. network. We’re positioning Lumen as the trusted network for AI, ensuring our customers have the network scale, speed, and reliability to confidently innovate and grow without constraints.”

**2025 milestones on the road to 47 million intercity fiber miles****^(1)****:**

* **Deployed New Fiber:** Added more than **2.2 million new intercity fiber miles**(2,500+ route miles) and projected to reach 16.6 million total intercity fiber miles by year end. Lumen is utilizing next-generation fiber optic cable from Corning Incorporated to fit two times more fiber into existing conduit.
* **Constructed Signal Boosters:** Construction efforts underway at **176 In-Line Amplifier (ILA) sites**. ILA shelters built on these sites serve as giant signal boosters along the Lumen network with up to triple the power density compared to traditional ILA shelters and are designed to be updated, renewed, and scaled for the future.
* **Expanded Conduit Access:** Completed **IRU conduit deployments across 55 additional routes** expanding Lumen’s ability to add and control fiber on these routes by securing long-term rights to underground pathways.
* **Increased Network Capacity:** Added **5.9+ Pbps of total capacity** to the Lumen network so far this year, preparing to deliver the bandwidth needed to handle large volumes of data processing.
* **Extended Faster Speeds**: Earmarked more than **$100 million to bring high-speed connectivity** up to 400Gbps across clouds, data centers, and metros, creating a more seamless, high-performance pipeline for AI workloads. **The Lumen 400G-enabled network now spans more than 100,000 route miles**.

Lumen Private Connectivity Fabric (PCF) is designed for AI workloads. By using fiber with 25% less optical loss than competitors^(2) and 60% more capacity than traditional designs, PCF helps move data more efficiently and at greater scale. The Lumen network achieves latency less than five milliseconds at the edge, covering up to 97% of U.S. business demand. And with diverse routes connecting more than 50 major cities, Lumen operates the largest ultra-low-loss intercity fiber network in North America.

“Every mile of new fiber and capacity upgrade adds to the strength of our Private Connectivity Fabric. Lumen is doing more than expanding infrastructure, we’re laying the foundation for the AI economy,” added Prigg.",19,13,2025-09-26 07:46:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nqv9l4/lumen_accelerates_multibilliondollar_network/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858500

1nqm5g2,stocks,Tesla’s continuing sales slump in Europe weighs on stock price,"Tesla shares fell more than 4% on Thursday after data out of Europe showed a continuing sales slump for the automaker, despite strong demand for fully electric vehicles in the region. 

Tesla EV registrations in Europe, a proxy for sales, fell by about 23% year-over-year in August, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) on Thursday.

There were 14,831 Tesla EV registrations in Europe last month, down from 19,136 in August 2024. In the first eight months of this year, Tesla EV registrations in Europe declined 32.6%, the ACEA said.

Meanwhile, total EV registrations throughout the region rose by around 26% through August compared to the same period in 2024. By contrast, registrations for petrol and diesel-powered vehicles declined by more than 20% over that stretch.

Still, RBC analysts wrote in a note on Thursday that they expect Tesla’s total deliveries for the third quarter could amount to 456,000, above a FactSet-compiled consensus of 448,000 deliveries and a Visible Alpha consensus of 440,000 deliveries.

The analysts expect a bump for Tesla as consumers rush to buy EVs in the U.S. before a $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September.

Even with Thursday’s slide, Tesla’s stock has bounced back following a brutal start to the year. It’s now up 5% in 2025 after plunging 36% in the first quarter.

Musk’s political activism in the U.S. and beyond has hurt the Tesla brand and dampened its appeal to many prospective EV buyers.

Earlier this year, Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party, and this month he appeared by video at an anti-immigrant rally in the U.K. that turned violent. The rally was led by activist Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer rebuked Musk for “dangerous” comments that he made at the rally, where 26 police officers were injured. Musk told attendees, “violence is coming to you” and “you either fight back or you die.”

To revitalize interest in the brand, Tesla has said an affordable new model is in the works, which could help it fend off increased competition from the likes of Volkswagen, BYD and other EV makers that have been picking up market share.

1nqft68,stocks,UPST: AI + Finance with BIG squeeze potential at play!,"$UPST (Upstart) is a AI powered lending platform and currently have around a **26%** float short with **3.2** days to cover. In 2021 they hit almost **$400** per share and with the lower interest rate environment their fundamentals are drastically improving again!

**Why it’s squeezable**

* **Short interest:** **\~21.1M shares** short = **\~26.3%** of float; **days to cover \~3.2**.
* **Float:** \~**84.1M** shares.
* **Borrow dynamics:** IBKR **CTB \~0.4–0.6%** lately; available shares fluctuating (\~150k–350k seen). If price trends up, borrow can dry up fast.

**Fundamentals massively improving**

* **Q2’25 revenue:** **$257M, +\~102% YoY.**
* **GAAP net income:** **+$5.6M** (vs. loss a year ago).
* **Volume:** loans +\*\*\~159% YoY\*\*, dollar volume **\~$2.8B**.
* Balance sheet and guidance commentary point to continued normalisation of funding.

**Macro tailwind**

* **U.S. Q2 GDP revised to 3.8% annualized**, a solid backdrop for risk assets and consumer credit cyclicals like UPST

**Price targets**

* Street 12 month PTs cluster around **$81 avg** (range **$47–$108**), implying notable upside from here. However, this could go MUCH higher with the interest rate cuts now planned and their improving financials - plus with the squeeze potential.

**Catalysts**

* Next earnings + any funding/partner expansions
* Options OI building into earnings can add fuel too

**Levels I’m watching**

* Break/hold above recent supply zone = go time, invalidation is a decisive close back below the last higher low so watch for this...

**Thesis:** Shorts are crowded into a name that just flipped back to profitable with triple digit revenue growth, right as macro prints strong. If UPST clears resistance with momentum then its going to blow up...

I'm new to investing in stocks. So far, I've mostly purchased value stocks like RY and TD (I'm Canadian). A couple of months ago, a family member suggested I buy LEU. I missed the opportunity to buy it around $200 CAD, and now the stock is trading around $400 CAD per share.

I'm curious, should I wait for the stock price to come down, or is it okay to buy at a higher price if it seems to keep rising? I currently own only 5 shares of LEU (bought at about $278/share) but could buy more. I'm just hesitant because I’m not sure if it's normal practice to buy stocks at this price.

1nq6s8e,stocks,Intel jumps 8%… while Marvell spends $5B on buybacks,"This morning while scrolling through Bitget’s RWA perpetual futures index, I stumbled on something I honestly didn’t expect: **Intel pumping +8%** and Marvell announcing a $5 billion share buyback. I wasn’t expecting to see these two “old guards” of semiconductors shaking the market at the same time.

For Intel, the rally came from a mix of catalysts lining up. Micron’s strong earnings gave confidence back to the sector, and Intel raised its outlook for 2025. With around 76% market share in x86, they’re better positioned than many thought. Digging deeper, I saw they’re preparing the Panther Lake (18A) launch for late 2025, getting US government and SoftBank support for their AI/foundry ambitions, and placing large orders with ASML for the next-gen High-NA EUV machines. They even announced an AI partnership with Trust Stamp, focusing on biometrics and privacy. No surprise analysts bumped the price target up to $43 with a buy rating.

Marvell, on the other hand, is playing a different card: a massive $5 billion buyback, including a $1B accelerated program with $300M already executed this quarter. Instead of betting on a future product or tech breakthrough, they’re giving back directly to shareholders to boost confidence in the near term.

What struck me is the contrast. Intel is trying to rewrite its future by going all-in on AI and foundry, while Marvell is choosing immediate stability. Two very different visions in the same sector, but both managed to move the market big time at the same moment.

What do you think? Can Intel really reinvent itself for the long run, or is this just a short-term rebound?",146,119,2025-09-25 13:28:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq6s8e/intel_jumps_8_while_marvell_spends_5b_on_buybacks/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858586

Copper prices jumped Wednesday after Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) declared force majeure on contracted supplies from its Grasberg Block Cave mine in Indonesia.

Three-month futures traded above $10,496 per ton ($4.7710 per lb.) on the CME, up 2.74% for the day. In London, copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 2% to $10,172 a ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest level in more than 15 months.

Freeport’s shares fell as much as 10.4% in New York, while rivals Glencore PLC (+3%), Teck Resources (+5%), and Antofagasta (+7.4%) climbed.

Analysts described it as a “negative near-term development that will likely put Freeport in the penalty box.” However, BMO also highlighted that 60% of Freeport’s copper production comes from North and South America, meaning the company still has strong regional output. At the same time, a potential increase in copper prices stemming from reduced supply could partly offset the impact.",40,2,2025-09-25 11:00:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nq3oqn/copper_price_spikes_on_freeports_grasberg_force/,2025-09-30 15:06:15.858606

1nprxr3,stocks,"Nvidia Stock, poised to surpass 230 by year end","Nvidia stock is very misunderstood. Many have been shorting at 180’s and buying at 170’s. It’s been doing this since July 28th. Consolidating for nearly two months.

Nvidia’s key points 

1. They’re not lying about demand. I haven’t heard anyone comment about China not being relevant to their success…the reason Nvidia isn’t concerned is simply because demand surpasses supply even without China.

2. Nvidia has been talking with intel behind the scenes for about a year confirmed by Jensen. If we read in between the lines it means they’ve likely already sucessfully merged a product with intel. Nvidia should never be underestimated with the resources they have at their disposal. Another market Nvidia will dominate and quickly take shares of.

3. Nvidia is an early investor in many of the upcoming giants of tomorrow like NBIS and CoreWeave. All those gains are net positives for Nvidia and only contribute to continued growth. NBIS for example has the most significant growth rates I’ve ever seen a company produce. 820percent revenue before Microsoft deal? That’s execution.

4. OpenAI isn’t a public company,Nvidia is now getting a slice of the most desired AI  company that’s still operating privately. People don’t understand that now Nvidia will have access to all the data OpenAI has…

I could just go on for paragraphs about all the deals Nvidia is doing, about the acceleration of new products but one thing we forgot to mention is Nvidia Hasn’t Moved in Stock price despite having a forward PE of 31…..while the s@p average is currently 27. Why is that you ask? Because currently the market couldn’t give a sht about value.The needle won’t explode with a stock valued at 4.35trillion like oracle or Crypto. 

Nvidia is an exceptional company that’s constantly preformed,evolved and is without a doubt the centre of AI and even still insane growth potential. 

Stocks spend months in consolidation period Nvidia has definitely been doing that, simply a no brainer buy. 

It’s an Undervalued stock considering it’s crop dusting any other of the mag 7. 

I am an Nvidia Investor and I’ve added more today at 176.20 as I believe we’ll see a big rotation in Nvidia and several other chip stocks, I’ve averaged up from 91 to a current of 120 because I see this as a great opportunity for solid gains.

1npqgit,stocks,Kenvue ($KVUE) is insanely undervalued just bought $50k at $16.58.,"Solid play? I’m planning to swing it up to $22+. Worst case scenario, I enjoy a generous 4.75% div yield backed by established consumer brands. (This was cash from my Robinhood account yielding 3.75% APY)

I’m feeling good about it but curious for your take. Solid move or not?

Kenvue’s a powerhouse with brands like Tylenol, Neutrogena, and Listerine. They’re pulling $15.5B in revenue and $2.1B in free cash flow.

1npo92f,stocks,"""5 Reasons Amazon Will Double"" - Joseph Carlson","Disclosure I'm a fan of Joseph Carlson and a holder of Amazon. Posting this so smarter people than myself can poke holes at the thesis and spark productive discussion. I can't post link to the youtube video per subreddit rules. Below is a Claude summary of the video transcripts.

## Amazon Stock Analysis - Main Thesis

• **Current underperformance**: Amazon is the worst performing Mag 7 stock in 2025, up only 6% year-to-date while others like Google (+30%) and Meta (+26%) are crushing it

• **AWS concerns**: Investors worried about Amazon Web Services growing only 17.5% vs Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%)

• **CEO misstep**: Andy Jassy's poor earnings call response failed to address investor concerns about slower AWS growth

## Five Reasons Amazon Will Double (Go to $400)

### 1. AWS Dominance & Diversification
• AWS has $120 billion run rate, nearly as big as Azure and Google Cloud combined  
• Over 4 million customers vs Microsoft's estimated 1 million  
• More diversified customer base leads to consistent, compounded growth  
• New Trainium chips and Anthropic AI partnership creating vertical integration

### 2. Robotics & Automation Leadership  
• Amazon employs 1.5 million people globally, with 700,000 in warehouses and delivery  
• Already operating autonomous Zoox vehicles in Vegas with no driver  
• Massive opportunity to automate repetitive tasks and reduce $60 billion annual labor costs  
• Will follow Amazon's pattern: build for themselves first, then sell to others

### 3. Prime Ecosystem & High Lifetime Value
• Amazon Prime has become standard household membership with incredible value proposition  
• Prime Video becoming major entertainment destination, rivaling Netflix  
• Multiple benefits: delivery, entertainment, music, gaming, photos, exclusive deals  
• High customer lifetime value with daily usage patterns

### 4. Advertising Business Growth
• Third largest advertiser globally behind Google and Meta  
• Advertising revenue growing near 20% annually  
• Retail advertising still early and underoptimized with high margins  
• Expanding to Prime Video, Twitch, and even brokering ads for Netflix

### 5. Logistics Network Scale
• Built logistics network comparable to UPS, FedEx, and DoorDash combined  
• Now offering fulfillment services to competitors like Walmart and Shopify  
• Planning to launch in every major manufacturing location globally  
• Scale creates further scale advantages in cost-effective logistics",261,114,2025-09-24 21:14:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npo92f/5_reasons_amazon_will_double_joseph_carlson/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761495

> Regulators are moving to dismantle one of the most controversial barriers for active retail traders the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day trading. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on Tuesday approved amendments that would replace the long-standing threshold, making active day trading more accessible to smaller accounts. The change is pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

> The $25,000 minimum equity rule mandates that traders must maintain a minimum account balance of $25,000 in a margin account to execute four or more day trades within a five-business-day period. The rule was put in place in 2001 amid the dot-com bubble and crash as regulators grew worried that small traders were taking excessive risks with volatile internet stocks.

> FINRA is replacing this mandate with an intraday margin rule that applies the existing maintenance margin rules to intraday exposure. In other words, one’s intraday buying power will be based on the margin requirements for the positions they take on during the day, not a fixed equity minimum.

1npgy3w,stocks,Question about a financial advisor’s choices,"I have a general question for folks who have long-term experience with financial advisors. I have been with my advisor for a very long time. More than 20 years. Up until the last few years I was extremely busy, and mentally fully occupied, with a demanding career. I left things to the advisor, although I met with him annually. His approach has been very conservative for an extremely conservative throughout that time, way before retirement was on the horizon, and returns have been muted even though the market has shown a long-term uptrend. In a nutshell, it is his practice not to own any individual stocks in a portfolio, in deference to various bond/money market and mutual fund investments. Think 60/40 scenario. A substantial amount of the portfolio has been devoted to foreign stocks, also held in mutual funds, that for many years were essentially flat or declined to some extent compared to US equities. In the last year or so, those have done much better as we all know. These investments have shifted and been adjusted over the years, but very slowly, and with little responsivity to large changes in market conditions. My question is essentially is this a common approach for financial advisors? Of course, it’s clear that such an approach makes managing client’s accounts much less labor intensive, and if one’s clientele is especially sensitive to volatility, it minimizes that factor and probably calms nerves. So it’s easier for an advisor to approach things this way.

1npgter,stocks,Stagflation Sell-off Incoming,"Unemployment rate is ticking up and the Fed has described their dual mandate: lowering unemployment rate while making sure inflation doesn't run up on us.

This is an extremely tricky situation. The Fed thinks they can rate-cut their way to lowering unemployment. This is not going to work. Lowering rates simply frees up capital - it doesn't guarantee job creation. There is currently no shortage of capital as evident by the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI infrastructure. Lowering rates will simply free up more cash for these types of long-term AI investments that will end up reducing more human labor than it creates.

Also, as the Fed lowers rates, inflation (compounded by tariffs driving up costs) will go much higher. This puts the Fed in a very uncomfortable economic trend called stagflation. It's the elephant in the room that no one wants to publicly say. We're heading toward stagflation. Risk assets will sell off in the short-term. In the longer-term, there will be winners and losers.

1npf99s,stocks,"Fermi America IPO, is this Legit?","It seems like this company is well positioned to do what they say they would. They plan to supply the energy for data centers with a nuclear plant in Amarillo, Texas. It was founded by Rick Perry and Toby Neugebauer who both have deep ties to both the Texas government and Texas energy sector; which likely smooth permitting processes/timelines. Work and construction set to begin next year, and first plant operational by 2032.

But there’s three big red flags for me. For one this company is relatively new. The second piece is going back to the fact that this plant would be in Amarillo, Texas. Where are they going to get the water from to cool a nuclear plant, and how the heck would it be affordable if it needs to be piped in from somewhere else? Last piece is cash burn, I’ve read they’ve secured 350M in private funding already; and are hoping to secure another 550M from going public. But I see that nuclear plants can cost anywhere from 6B-9B, so for something that would be completed in 7 years it seems like they would need more cash than they hope to get via IPO to meet that goal. Do they already have contracts lined up that’ll front the construction costs? Or maybe government funding they’re expecting that hasn’t been announced? 

All to say, some numbers aren’t adding up to me here and the company is pretty fresh. If it weren’t for the founders having deep ties to the Texas energy sector I could more definitively say this is an AI hype cash grab than a legitimate push.  

The primary growth prospects before the plant opens is the company hitting construction milestones, potentially receiving government funding, and signing contracts to supply data centers. At that point it seems like you’d sell the news.

Any other thoughts on this? I’d personally need to see answers around where the water comes from and how they expect to get the rest of the cash needed for construction given the aggressive timeline btwn now and the first plant opening.",38,65,2025-09-24 15:30:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1npf99s/fermi_america_ipo_is_this_legit/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761689

1npc6fd,stocks,$CDTX: FDA Minutes Confirm Expanded + Accelerated Phase 3 for Cidara’s Flu Prophylaxis CD388,"In my first post ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or am I missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) I hinted (very strongly!) that FDA minutes for Cidara's ""End of Phase 2"" meeting could be a major turning point for Cidara. That news is now official, and it’s even stronger than expected:

**1. Phase 3 accelerated**

* Start pulled forward by 6 months:  enrollment begins Fall ’25 in the Nothern Hemisphere, not Spring ’26 as previously planned.

**2. Single Phase 3 may be sufficient for approval**

* FDA supporting that CD388 could go straight to a **BLA filing off one registrational study** if phase 3 is successful. That cuts **2–3 years** off the approval timeline.

**3. Expanded patient population**

* Originally: high-risk comorbidities + immunocompromised.
* Now: also includes **all adults ≥65**, significantly expanding U.S. eligibility to **100M+ patients**.

**Why this matters**

* FDA support for BLA filing after this phase 3 trial is a huge signal of confidence.
* The accelerated start reduces time-to-revenue.
* Expansion to ≥65 significantly expands the potential TAM.
* Together, these updates shrink the “binary biotech discount” the market is still applying to CD388.

**What’s next?**

The next milestone is a potential BARDA award, with a decision expected by year-end (unclear if that means government fiscal year-end in September or calendar year-end in December).

Cidara has been clear: they are seeking BARDA’s help to onshore and scale manufacturing capacity. That may not mean an immediate stockpiling contract, but it’s still a strategic step. For CD388 to play a role in pandemic preparedness, the U.S. government will want domestic supply secured.

So the way I see it:

* Best case: BARDA supports manufacturing build-out and future stockpiling.
* Baseline case: BARDA helps de-risk manufacturing scale-up, validating CD388 as a preparedness asset.

Either outcome reinforces CD388’s long-term strategic value.

**Bottom line**

Universal flu prophylaxis used to be fiction. With today’s FDA minutes, CD388 is:

* Accelerated
* Expanded
* Supported by the FDA
* And fully funded through Phase 3

The market is still treating CD388 like a long shot. Today’s FDA news makes it clear: this is less and less about ""if"",  and increasingly about ""when.”

In my next post, I’ll do a deeper dive into why CD388’s probability of success is higher than most Phase 3 assets and update my rNPV valuation to reflect this news.

1npbyeg,stocks,$PATH Toward a Multi-bagger,"I have been building my position in PATH for about a year now and am starting to see a recent surge in interest. After noticing a bunch of ""why PATH?"" posts across various subreddits, I decided to provide my thesis:

* UiPath's flagship legacy product is currently the MARKET LEADER in enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA) - automating repetitive, generally clerical tasks for enterprises by leveraging PATH's ""software robots"" which can scrape processes and repeat tasks very efficiently (think of robust ""if this, then that"" rules).
* In October 2024, they announced that they were re-building their software suite to be focused on agentic AI with the goal of becoming the primary agnostic software player that would automate entire workflows at the top layer of the enterprise and allow customers to build across third party applications (i.e., not caging enterprises into the walled gardens of Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.). This is a game-changer, as it would go way beyond the rule-based constraints of RPA - it would leverage generative AI to let the software make decisions across platforms.
* In Spring of 2025, UiPath released their Maestro enterprise orchestration software and began putting together proof-of-concepts for their customers. The feedback has been great as Maestro allows customers to build custom end-to-end workflows that combine UiPath's industry-leading RPA technology with the newly released suite of generative AI capabilities. UiPath has a huge advantage over competition as they are already a trusted provider of software automation for over TEN THOUSAND enterprise customers.
* Their go-to-market strategy is super compelling as they have massive partnerships with Deloitte and SAP to help market their products. They also have strong relationship with other software providers like LangChain and Microsoft to ensure UiPath is staying relevant and connected with top companies in the supply chain.
* From a financial perspective, their balance sheet is INSANELY STRONG. Zero debt and $1.5B of cash/marketable securities on-hand.
* They recently made a strategic acquisition of Peak AI to further their product offering by adding a specialized inventory and pricing management AI agent to their software stack.
* Their CEO and founder Daniel Dines is a GENIUS who owns 10% of the company (massive skin in the game). He had the vision, technical prowess, and leadership skills to essentially invent the enterprise RPA market and dominate it before anyone else - he is now going after the enterprise agentic AI space.
* Share price is currently insanely cheap at 4-5x trailing twelve-month sales. Their revenue has been growing at decent clip of \~10% per year, but that doesn't even include the inevitable growth of their agentic AI products that are just now starting to be marketed and gain traction. The market has been sleeping on UiPath and the growth of their new agentic AI automation software is not priced in at all - the industry is projected to grow at a 40% CAGR between now and the end of the decade. Even in a stock market pullback, I think downside risk is pretty limited given the cheap multiple they're already trading at.
* A weakening labor market (which is where we're headed) is bullish for a company that is selling software that allows companies to automate processes and ""do more with less"". So owning PATH is also a natural hedge against the unemployment rate going up.

For all these reasons, PATH has become the second largest position in my portfolio.

1np4t1k,stocks,Insider trading,"I have a rather interesting question about insider trading. Let's say you love lab testing food at the grocery store for microbes/ contaminants in your own home lab for fun. You dont even work as a scientist for your career, let's say you are a healthcare worker on a hospital. If you detect let's say a very nasty strain of E. Coli on some salad. Nothing in the news has been said about this. Is it illegal for me to short the company's stock before the company/ FDA/ media has announced  a recall? Google's AI said this could be MNPI.


TLDR, is it insider trading for somebody that has nothing to do with a certain company as a consumer testing their products as a hobby and shorting the companies products that would flag a recall before the news has said it.",1,49,2025-09-24 06:19:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1np4t1k/insider_trading/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761758
1np25et,stocks,Why do people trade stocks instead of just holding for the long term?,"I’ve always been told that long term investing is the best strategy for most people. Literally any investing related sub will tell you that. The most common advice is “time in the market beats timing the market,” and that if you buy quality companies or broad index funds and just hold for decades, you’ll come out ahead.

But then I see so many people actively trading stocks. Sometimes daily, sometimes weekly, trying to time short term moves. From the outside, it feels like that goes against the idea of long-term compounding, especially when you factor in taxes and trading costs.

So what exactly is the appeal of trading over long-term investing? Do traders believe they can consistently beat the market? Is it more about short-term cash flow rather than long-term wealth building? The excitement that comes with it?

1nox758,stocks,VOO vs VYM Long-Term,"Hi,

Been looking at some periodic rebalancing of my holdings in my long-term portfolio, and I'm both in VOO and VYM. I liked having a mix, and VYM is known for its dividend yield, AND also how it weathered the 2022 bear market. I'm having trouble finding the tools on Fidelity to compare both, including their dividends. While VYM only did +76% over the last 5yrs, and VOO around +101%, VYM carries the dividend factor that offsets some of that gap and brings it closer.

What's your take on it, and where should I be looking forward?

I've also begun investing in VGT, which is the tech sector - which I think is a hot one right now. Over 5yrs, that one did +145%! As long as AI is driving the market in a big way, I think the tech sector one is a good one to have, at least short-term.",0,4,2025-09-23 23:45:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nox758/voo_vs_vym_longterm/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761774

I understand those figures are for mutual funds, but it seems like 4% is really low. I've held this portfolio for about 12 years, and the first few were under advisors who underperformed. It's been doing better, but I really feel that it should be doing MUCH better, unless I am misunderstanding the concept and the numbers.

There was of course the market crash a few years ago, but the revised figures should have accounted for that.

1noq1ae,stocks,Fed Chief Powell says stock prices appear 'fairly highly valued',"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/fed-powell-stock-prices-appear-fairly-highly-valued.html

> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels. During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

> “We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we’re trying to achieve,” Powell said. “But you’re right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.” In the run-up to last week’s policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

> “Markets listen to us and follow and they make an estimation of where they think rates are going. And so they’ll price things in,” Powell said in part of the conversation dealing with mortgage rates. Though Powell noted the lofty equity values, he said this is “not a time of elevated financial stability risks.”",1105,170,2025-09-23 18:56:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1noq1ae/fed_chief_powell_says_stock_prices_appear_fairly/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761794

> On the heels of Nvidia’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI, two research notes out today suggest the current boom in AI may be unsustainable.
> 
> “AI machines - in quite a literal sense - appear to be saving the U.S. economy right now,” George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank wrote to clients. “In the absence of tech-related spending, the U.S. would be close to, or in, recession this year.” 

...

> Whatever the number is, it is so massive that it’s boosting GDP, Deutsche’s Saravelos said: “It may not be an exaggeration to write that NVIDIA - the key supplier of capital goods for the AI investment cycle - is currently carrying the weight of U.S. economic growth. The bad news is that in order for the tech cycle to continue contributing to GDP growth, capital investment needs to remain parabolic. This is highly unlikely.”
> 
> He also noted that “growth is not coming from AI itself but from building the factories to generate AI capacity.”

...

> AI spending is also distorting the stock market, Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid argued in a separate note published this morning. “The S&P 500 is now up +13.81% so far this year, whereas the equal-weighted version is only up +7.65%.

1nog1cb,stocks,"American Superconductor (AMSC): real revenue, big cash, defense/grid tech, and increasing power demands but next to no discussion?","AMSC posted Q1 FY2025 revenue of $72.4M (≈ +80% YoY), GAAP net income of about $6.7M, and $213 million cash on hand after a $115M offering, a multi-year $200 million backlog from defense and industrial orders, and an accretive acquisition that improves margins. That combination makes AMSC one of the cleaner mid-cap growth plays I’ve seen recently but there’s very little discussion around this company compared to other energy-adjacent players.

American Superconductor (AMSC) is a ~40 year old systems company for megawatt-scale grid resilience, data centers, wind controls and naval ship protection (high-power electronics, STATCOMs/D-VAR, high-temp superconducting wire which is basically super efficient power transmission, ship protection systems). The company recently added NWL, which brings recurring industrial and defense power sales. They seem to be a differentiated niche leader. AMSC owns useful HTS and power-electronics IP and has won program-level naval and utility work (like a ~$75M Canadian Navy deal). That combination (IP + visible contracts + cash/backlog) is what makes the company interesting to me.

If AMSC consistently convert bookings at decent margins and avoid further dilution, you get margin expansion + multiple re-rating (defense contracts + grid demand are sticky, and their tech is already shipping). If they don’t, downside is fast. Same facts cut both ways. The company has a very relevant set of products as energy grids and fleets demand more power density and stability to integrate wind, solar, rapidly-increasing data center loads and advanced naval systems.

I’m curious to hear from anyone who knows much about AMSC, currently invests in them, or understands their market niche well. Trying to gauge if there’s as much upside left here as it seems.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

*Oklo Inc today holds a groundbreaking ceremony at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for its first Aurora powerhouse, the Aurora-INL. The event will feature opening remarks from Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte and INL Director John Wagner, keynote remarks from U.S. Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, and brief remarks from officials including Idaho Governor Bradley Little, Utah Governor Spencer Cox, U.S. Senators Mike Crapo and James Risch, U.S. Congressman Mike Simpson, Idaho Lieutenant Governor Scott Bedke, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Commissioner Bradley Crowell, U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Michael Goff and Robert Boston, and Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper.*

*Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.*

*“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”*

*The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.*

*“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”*

*“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.*

*Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.*

*The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.*

*“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”*",86,45,2025-09-22 22:06:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1no03ff/oklo_breaks_ground_on_first_aurora_powerhouse/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761887

Retail traders are very active, margin debt is climbing, and there’s a lot of speculation.

1nny89w,stocks,Long Term AI Strategy,"AI has been developing rapidly for the last few years and it's becoming clear that it is not going away anymore. Let's zoom out a bit. What is a good strategy to capitalize on a still very young industry with new players joining every day? I'm currently seeing three main segments that drive revenue with a TAM that's rapidly expanding across all three segments:

**Infrastructure**
Companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft and Oracle are building chips and datacenters to generate compute. All of the MAG7 companies are investing heavily in their own facilities to become a big player in the scene without any sign of slowing down.

**Data**
The place the internet comes together is a goldmine for LLM's to be trained on. Places Like X (Twitter) (owned by xAI) GitHub (owned by Microsoft, very valuable for coding), Stack overflow, Wikipedia, Quora, but maybe the biggest and most valuable of them all, yes, Reddit. A very important aspect of why Reddit's conversations are very valuable is because there is no money incentive like on X. The company has gone public in 2024 and has done licensing deals with Google and OpenAI and others worth 200M+ annually. They are reportedly currently in talks with Google for a much bigger deal. The platform is imo mildly monetized and thus growing rapidly. A company worth looking into financially.

**Applications**
Probably the biggest and widest segment that has yet to fully materialize is the way AI has been putting itself on the market as a product. The most obvious applications are LLM's like ChatGPT, but OpenAI is not close to profitability. Self-Driving cars are also slowly being applied, but in low numbers. Public companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce and Palantir are among a bigger group of companies well positioned to thrive in this segment.

AI is no longer just a buzzword. The companies that control infrastructure, data, or applications are setting the rules of the game. The next few years are going to separate the leaders from the followers. If you’re looking to understand where value is being created, AI is still a an early opportunity.",2,19,2025-09-22 20:51:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nny89w/long_term_ai_strategy/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761906

But then comes the question, what stock? I’m torn between something she would actually have a relation to, like the company itself. Or a stock that is not to expensive and would do good. Preferably both of this.

We live in Scandinavia if that helps with the cultural context and she’s into gaming like Roblox and really enjoys K-pop (Katseye) and music. She’s also into makeup and is overall quite creative.

And both companies (OpenAI and Oracle) will spend the majority of their compute dollars on Nvidia GPUs

So Nvidia has no incentive to stop investing in companies that buy their GPUs, datacenter infrastructure providers have no incentive to stop signing glamorous multi-billion dollar deals with AI companies, and so on and so forth all the way down the stack

All the while I don't think these AI companies with consumer and business-facing software are actually making any money from these ventures (or at least a lot of them aren't). They seem to be surviving and thriving entirely based off of this circular investment scheme

1nntg89,stocks,"In a low rates environment, nearly all equities are winners. Why stocks only go up. (For now).","It feels like, no matter the bad news, equities just keep climbing. Here’s the(my) reasoning as to why this is happening and why it'll likely continue.

First, let’s state the obvious: we’re not in a low-rate environment right now. However there are some things happening that are leading to one. Regardless of your views of the current U.S. president, he’s been pushing Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. So far, Powell has remained focused on the economic data and stayed independent in his decision-making. However, Powell’s term ends in about eight months (May 15, 2026). Once that happens, it seems almost inevitable that Trump will try to appoint someone more in line with his agenda, someone who will likely push for rate cuts until his target rate of around 1.5% is reached (this seems to be the consensus, though I’ve seen various estimates).

If/when that happens, I expect markets to take off for the foreseeable future. Why? Because lower rates mean cheaper borrowing. A simple(although flawed as mortgage loans are amortized amongst other things) example:

A $500K home at 2% interest would cost roughly $665K over 30 years (assuming no early payments).

A $500K home at 6% interest would cost $1.1 million over the same period.

This is basic economics, lower interest rates increase borrowing power, which lets companies expand faster and take on more risk.

Does this mean we’re heading for another major recession or depression eventually? Probably. But that timing is much harder to predict than the markets’ current expectation that a low-rate environment is coming.",55,30,2025-09-22 17:51:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nntg89/in_a_low_rates_environment_nearly_all_equities/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761930

1. Eli Lilly (LLY) – With its advanced immuno-oncology pipeline and existing blockbusters, it feels almost unavoidable. What stands out is their ability to diversify revenue while staying a leader in such a competitive field.


2. Pfizer (PFE) – Known for vaccines, but their oncology division is getting stronger with targeted acquisitions. Despite the post-COVID slump, I think they remain a solid long-term player in cancer treatment.


3. Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) – Probably one of the most robust oncology portfolios. Their CAR-T therapies look very promising, and while the stock price isn’t exploding right now, I believe it’s one to keep on the radar.

Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs first started rising when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies on Nvidia’s AI chips to develop its software and deploy it to users.

>It also signals just how many Nvidia chips OpenAI will need in order to develop next-generation artificial intelligence that can do more than its current models.

>“This is monumental in size,” CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview on Monday.

>“Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement.

>In August, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of those costs are for Nvidia chips and systems.

>Nvidia will join a roster of investors that valued OpenAI at $500 billion in a recent secondary round. Microsoft was one of OpenAI’s early investors, and has strategic partnership with it to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office.""









This is quite the circular economy we got going here. By investing in the deeply unprofitable startup that buys their product, they ensure demand for their products remains strong.

Probably the right move for Nvidia, because a lot of this money will come back to them, and they can sell their hardware at high Margins. And with their stock trading at 50x earnings, it makes sense to spend their cash flow on funding/acquiring AI startups rather than buying back shares.

This all but ensures the  AI bubble keeps going a couple more years, but also inflates it even further. MAG7 is becoming more and more exposed to AI, with cash flows going towards datacenter buildout and training AI models rather than innovation or shareholder returns.",585,169,2025-09-22 16:19:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnqz79/nvidia_will_invest_up_to_100_billion_in_openai/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761960

1nnpqxs,stocks,Markets And Gold Are Both Hitting ATHs. Last Time That Happened Was...,"COVID, which as a rare global event driven by a pandemic. Then, before that, in 2007. Right before it hit the fan in 2008 with the financial crisis.

Historically, gold and the markets have been divergent. When people are optimistic, they pile into the markets. When they get worried, they move into gold. It's pretty rare to see them both hitting ATHs at the same time. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

From my perspective, it seems all of society is bifurcated right now on just about everything. We have a large group of Chicken Little's, that think this is all going to blow up in our faces any day now. Even Warren/Berkshire is holding a record amount of cash and more T-Bills that the Treasury itself ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/why-warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-now-owns-more-treasury-bills-than-the-federal-reserve-11807572)). Conversely, we seem to have an equal size group of Pollyanna's that think we are entering into some sort of golden age and manage to find a silver lining in every bit of news (pun intended). I am somewhat agnostic and think both groups are not seeing things too clearly. At the end of the day, it is the optimistic crowd that drives the markets and set the prices. If they keep thinking they are getting a good deal and remain willing buy what the others are selling, and they believe in it enough to hold, then the markets will just keep going up or possibly plateau for a while until some external event drives them in either direction.

There is lots of money going into specific buckets right now, such as AI and crypto, which is also hitting ATHs. I have no idea what people think they will do with the stupid amount of money flowing into crypto and its offshoot financial products (other than trying to make a quick buck). And I think all the AI plays will take much longer to shake out and find the winners and losers than most people think (like the dot-com era). I view AI stocks with mind numbing P/Es, precious metals, and crypto as all something investors would need a high level of conviction and a buy-and-hold mindset to buy into right now at these levels. And I question how much conviction is really there.

With both groups (Chicken Little's and Pollyanna's) buying into both sides of fear and optimism, it seems like every scenario is priced in. It's like a double bubble face-off that just keeps growing, just waiting for something to happen. Even if more geopolitical turmoil erupts and/or inflation starts ticking back up with high unemployment, are people really going to buy in more to precious metals when they are at ATHs already? Without hitting the bottom line in spectacular fashion, is there any development that can get AI more hyped and inflated while we wait for it to generate a real ROI somewhere? And what if nothing happens at all and things more-or-less stay the same economically and geopolitically?",992,346,2025-09-22 15:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnpqxs/markets_and_gold_are_both_hitting_aths_last_time/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761966

1nnpcoc,stocks,Can Google Avoid a Breakup Twice?,"In a landmark decision this month, a federal judge spared Google from a breakup proposed by the government to rein in the company’s monopoly in search.

Now, the company wants a second win.

Starting on Monday, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema will hear arguments in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on how to fix Google’s monopoly over some online advertising technology. The judge ruled this year that Google had broken the law to protect its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places ads on pages across the web. The hearing is expected to last for two to three weeks.

The Justice Department has said it wants Google to sell the technology it uses to connect buyers and sellers of ad space, among other potential remedies. Google has instead proposed measures including changing its ad auction bidding system in ways that would benefit publishers.

Judge Brinkema’s ultimate decision could disrupt the company’s $3.1 trillion business and help rewrite the playbook for tech dominance in the modern internet era.

1nnk82c,stocks,Why Japanese Real Estate Small Caps Might Be the Best Value in Global Markets Right Now,"The Japanese stock market has finally climbed back to the highs it set during one of the largest financial bubbles in history (the 1980s). After three decades of deflation, several big shifts have changed the investment landscape in Japan:
	•	Urban land prices have finally recovered and are now growing again.
	•	Inflation has returned (modest, but enough to change behavior).
	•	The weak yen continues to attract foreign investment into Japanese assets, particularly real estate.
	•	Japanese households still hold 50%+ of their wealth in cash. That made sense in a deflationary environment, but now both the government and sentiment are pushing toward investment. Even Google Trends shows a surge in interest.
	•	Valuations are absurdly low. PEG ratios under 0.6 across these names, vs. stretched valuations in the U.S.
	•	Two of these companies are doubling EPS YoY, yet trade at single-digit PEs.
	•	IBKR lets you buy Japanese small caps directly, with margin rates around 1% for JPY. That cheap financing can even be used to hedge yen risk.
	•	Diversification benefit: given high valuations and frothy sentiment in the U.S., Japan offers both value and growth. Over time, other big retail brokerages will almost certainly add more Japanese stocks as interest grows.

Most of these companies are microcaps (hundreds of millions USD market cap), with one at ~$1B. They’re growing earnings fast, still early in their runway, and could easily re-rate higher as they mature.

Here are four that stand out:

⸻

CREAL (2998.T)
	•	Real estate crowdfunding platform (residential + hotels) with plans to launch a security token exchange for real estate by 2026.
	•	Vertically integrated: sources properties, packages them into funds, distributes on its own platform, and even operates some.
	•	Metrics:
	•	100% annual net income growth
	•	54% gross profit CAGR
	•	GMV +93% YoY
	•	Net margins improving each year
	•	Growing hotel operations (targeting 20 hotels in 2 years, fully digital/automated).
	•	Backed by SBI Holdings (13% stake).
	•	A true “subscription/toll bridge” style business in the making.

⸻

Loadstar (3482.T)
	•	Buys offices and hotels, leases them, and runs OwnersBook, a crowdfunding loan platform.
	•	~50% revenue and net income growth, ROE >30%.
	•	2.78% dividend, PE ~6, PEG 0.17.
	•	Opportunistic: bought hotels during peak COVID distress.
	•	Focused on acquiring low-priced office assets, improving them, and raising rents.
	•	Ex-Goldman Sachs team, ~50% insider ownership.

⸻

Good Life (2970.T)
	•	Provides one-stop services for real estate investors: land purchase, planning, design, construction, brokerage, rental management, and sales.
	•	Doesn’t hold properties, so less balance sheet risk in downturns.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Net income up 48% YoY
	•	Revenue up 44% YoY
	•	ROE ~29%
	•	PE ~11
	•	Share buybacks in 2025
	•	Fast growth with improving margins, currently managing ~7,158 units.

⸻

Kasumigaseki Capital (3498.T)
	•	Runs apartment hotels, refrigerated warehouses, and hospices in Japan, expanding internationally into SE Asia and Dubai.
	•	Model: buys land, develops projects, sells to investors/funds, and keeps recurring asset management fees.
	•	Transitioning toward direct ownership for margin expansion.
	•	Forecasting 10x net income growth in 5 years.
	•	Revenue up 10x in the last 4 years.
	•	~$1B market cap, with 27% insider ownership and 30% institutional ownership.
	•	Exposure to high-tailwind sectors: automated warehouses, hospice care, clean energy, digital asset management (via STOs).

⸻

Bottom line:
Japanese real estate small caps are a rare mix of hyper-growth, low valuations, insider ownership, and secular tailwinds. With the U.S. looking stretched, diversifying into Japan here looks like a once-in-a-generation setup.",90,87,2025-09-22 11:45:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nnk82c/why_japanese_real_estate_small_caps_might_be_the/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.761997

- Nuclear energy stocks are roaring upwards, sending nuclear energy speculative stocks soaring despite being loss-making, and despite no revenues in some cases (OKLO!), so it’s only a matter of time before attention turns to a high-growth, cash-generative business like Rolls Royce, which keeps announcing new deals.

- Rolls-Royce won a £2,500,000,000 deal in June to build nuclear reactors in the United Kingdom. Last week, they’ve issued a statement on it welcoming in the “Golden Age” of nuclear energy.

- Rolls-Royce builds and maintains the Nuclear reactors powering submarines.  They signed a £9,000,000,000 contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to provide long-term support for the existing fleet and future builds, securing its role in the UK's nuclear deterrent for decades to come.

- Earlier in September, Rolls-Royce announced their involvement in providing reactors for Australia's new fleet of nuclear submarines, under the AUKUS defense agreement with the UK and US, further expanding its role in nuclear submarine technology:

- Goldman Sachs have initiated coverage of RR with a Buy rating, with a target of £12.90 /  $17.40  - recognising the turnaround story since covid, and the huge profit margin and FCF improvements in recent years.

- Citigroup have upgraded their price target to £14.40 / $19.44.
(The difference appears to be that Citigroup have recognised how massively exciting the Nuclear Energy side of the business is, whereas Goldman haven’t even mentioned it.)

- The vast majority of analysts are rating RR a buy. 
 
- Saudi Arabia Railways will be using more Rolls-Royce engines in their trains than before. Since 2012, there have been seventy 12V 4000 engines used in trains operated by Saudi Arabia Railways, and – having been impressed by their quality even in the harshest of conditions – Saudi Arabia have ordered an additional 50 trains with RR engines, as announced a month ago.

Sure I’ve missed so many things there as all the many divisions of Rolls-Royce seems to be on turbo charge at the moment.

With aviation demand rising (and especially from Airbus more than Boeing),  with defence spending rising, and with the growing and desperate need for more sustainable energy solutions from nuclear, etc etc, it is inevitable that Rolls-Royce will be announcing more deals on all fronts in the coming weeks and months.  
[…and it can only help to be having dinner with the Trump and Starmer last week!]

On this basis, I believe we will £20 within the next 12 months =  74% higher than we are here.  And longer term it’ll be multiples of where it is today. And it is all backed up by solid real results - real revenues, real profit, and real deals worth billions.

I understand it’s pretty obvious markets would react negatively but how detrimental really would a large scale war in Europe be financially? 

Russia’s control of oil supply could send gas prices soaring but what about the economic impact from Eastern Europe at war? Russia doesn’t seem to be ready for a full scale war against NATO and seems to be testing the waters but they are preparing to do so. I think if we see congressmen start selling off their stocks like we saw before COVID that would be a great sell signal to GTFO before the market crashes. 

Historically how have markets reacted to large scale wars? We haven’t really had a large scale war since WW2 so we don’t have recent examples to go off of except maybe around 9/11 and the beginning of war in the Middle East but that doesn’t affect global markets like a war in Europe would.

1nn8wd5,stocks,The reason I’m shorting Harley-Davidson (HOG),"I decided to buy the $23, 1/15/27 puts for Harley-Davidson. I’ve been doing some research and have come to the conclusion that this would make a good short:

1. As a whole, they have failed to market to a younger demographic for the past decade or longer. The only people who I ever see on Harley’s are all older and have had their bikes for 10+ years. As their customers age and die, so does their business. Also, the two Harley stores (in my state at least) have become very rundown, dingy, poorly run operations.

2. Increasing costs to produce motorcycles due to tariffs. When your motorcycles cost $40,000 already, this can affect it pretty heavily.

3. Motorcycles are a luxury item. Especially Harley’s. When economic conditions are rough, there’s not many people willing to spend that kind of money on a non-essential item. If the market got even worse, it wouldn’t be good for Harley-Davidson.

4. Heavy revenue decline since 2023. Again, I think this is primarily related to their aging customer base.

5. Motorcycles sales have been sharply declining the past few years as well. I think it has become pretty well known that the general consensus is “motorcycles are dangerous”. Anyone who rides motorcycles, knows someone who has been injured or killed on a bike. It is not very uncommon in the community.

6. The overall state of the market makes me nervous. Everything’s great until it isn’t and I want to have a hedge against a potential downturn in the market. I think this company would be more heavily affected than anything else I could choose from.

Those are the main points. I’m sure there are some more that you guys could think of but I thought I would share what I thought about Harley Davidson.",147,91,2025-09-22 00:59:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nn8wd5/the_reason_im_shorting_harleydavidson_hog/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.762042

To evaluate their effectiveness, I ran a backtest where I took a 1000 dollar investment, and increased it's position by x% on every insider buy, where x is the increase in holdings that insider trader committed. Historically, for the insiders this returns 910% since 2019! (53 purchases, final total amt. invested of 7754$ in my fake portfolio)

Recently, this past week, I can see that insiders are starting to average in again (you can see this on any site that tracks this kind of stuff, Form 4s).

1nmvjuv,stocks,Is Kevin Plank Gearing Up To Take Under Armour (UAA) Private,"UAA stock is down 40% ytd. It’s down 90% the past 10 years. UAA market cap is down to just over $2 billion! Kevin Plank, founder & CEO, is focused on rebuilding the brand. This takes a longer term vision that can be at odds with Wall Street’s focus on quarterly results. It’s definitely easier to do as a private company. Plank currently owns about 12% of the company and retains over 60% voting control. 

Plank recently sold his luxury hotel in Baltimore. He has his Maryland horse farm estate listed for sale for $18 million. Could Plank be gearing up financially to make a bid to take UAA private as he looks to rebuild the brand! Plank has a relationship with BDT Capital Partners (Byron Trott & Michael Dell’s merchant banking firm), so he certainly has access to capital & brains skilled in these transactions.

1nm567c,stocks,The Future of RDDT Stock,"Hi everyone, I wanted to open up some discussion on RDDT stock. I think a lot of people are investing for the wrong reasons, have it wrong, or are misguided about the company. I do have stock in RDDT so please take what I say with a grain of salt, but I will try to be fair. Also, I am not saying that I am all knowing. If anything, I hope for some good discussion and to be proven wrong.


1. Data Licensing

First of all, I believe the average retail investor is blowing out of proportion the impact of Data Licensing for RDDT. It obviously is good to have and is an investment positive in and of itself, but people overstate the revenue impact. In terms of last quarter, data licensing revenue was about 7% of overall revenue. This is obviously not an insignificant number, but the advertising revenue grew 81% YoY compared to data licensing’s 24% growth rate.

This means that data licensing is becoming an even smaller portion of revenue over time, even though it is increasing on a nominal basis. Another thing about data licensing revenue is that RDDT said they had already entered a lot of large value contracts, and that the following ones would be economically smaller but more numerous in terms of the amount of contracts. They have a contract renewal with GOOG which is obviously great, but it is unlikely going to be anything that dramatically moves the needle. A positive about Data Licensing though is that it is pretty much straight profitability. Also, even though it might not be too huge of a revenue impact, it shows that RDDT will be cemented in the future age of AI and LLMs since you need the authentic human interaction.


2. Advertising

This is where I am extremely bullish on RDDT. The unique user base, the highly relevant content and discussion, the targeted ads, the fact that RDDT users are more likely to go on this platform for product choices and purchase recommendations all contribute into what could be a booming advertising platform. There are a few caveats and things to consider, however. I want to start off with what could be a negative.

User growth is slowing. RDDT no longer has the new IPO hype wave and wave of news flowing around it, which could have caused a lot more user attention and growth. Daily Active Users in the US fell this past quarter and they have historically had an issue of converting passive logged-out users to active and intent logged-in users. This is something to watch out for. RDDT in the last earnings call Q&A stated that there were some hiccups with organic traffic from Google Search, and user growth increased by the end of the quarter, but still watch out.

This post is actually getting long as hell, so I don’t want to go on too much longer, but I’ll finish off with where I’m most excited. The opportunity to increase the average revenue per user is immense. New product and dynamic ads, optimizing ad inventory, new ad types, and more are coming. Look into ARPU measures and that’s what you can be excited about for RDDT. You don’t even need user growth for RDDT to be able to increase revenue by multiples (partially joking but it is crazy how much monetization potential there is.) Obviously they will never be Meta, but as the platform gains strength they have a lot to gain.

I am happy to include more based on everybody’s reception, but I hope these points can start off a discussion about the future of the stock.",46,47,2025-09-20 18:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nm567c/the_future_of_rddt_stock/,2025-09-30 15:06:18.762093

This H1b policy is so ludicrous, there's no way it can be for real. A sudden $100k annual fee for each h1b employee without any warning is enough to instantly crater many companies and research institutions. Only the tech giants could afford to absorb these costs. It's not just engineers and programmers on h1b, it's researchers, teachers, doctors, nurses, actuaries, mathematicians, etc. using the H1b.

1nm2ecd,stocks,"Am I missing something, or is nebius free money right now","It seems like at this price, you can’t lose money. Their quarterly revenue a year from now will likely be above corweaves current quarterly revenue. But with less debt and better margins. Coreweave is currently valued at 60 billion, roughly 3x nebius. 

I think it’s even possible that nebius q3 revenue next year is 50% higher than coreweaves last quarter revenue.

And the wild thing is that many feel that coreweave is currently undervalued right now.

To me it seems like there is very low risk thanks to the Microsoft contract, and very high reward. If buying calls, potentially a 15x on your money if they hit 60 billion market cap 1 year from now.

Or am I missing something? Does someone have a deeper analysis to tell me why I’m crazy? Because I feel like I am right now.

They just 5x their yearly revenue, but the stock is only up 40% on the announcement

Edit: just to add: I think people are underestimating the experience at nebius. Nebius comes out of yandex, which was the Google of Eastern Europe.

Let’s be real here.  Stocks ALWAYS go up.  Look at the last 20 years.  We have had 9/11, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the worst pandemic in 100 years that completely shut down the economy and stocks STILL have went up substantially during all that turmoil.  

So despite overwhelming historical evidence that says otherwise, why do people always say to stay away from Margin?

1nlxych,stocks,ETFs that benefit from the likely multiple interest rate cuts and a probable strong Q4.,"**SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY)**:  It has a clean 10% run from late May that holds into September, which breaks the historical trend that is known for low volume and choppy price action.  This deviation could be a setup for an October treat that leads to a strong fourth quarter.

**iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF** **(TLT)**:  This long-term Treasury bond has gained price appreciation over the past month from the expected and subsequent federal interest rate cut this past Wednesday.  It is moving higher along with stocks from the interest rate cut, with two more likely rate cuts before the end of this year.  It peaked at $172.25 on Aug 6th, 2020, and has never gone below $80 for the past 23 years.  The Treasury Bond ETFs do not have the price action of stocks and other ETFs, but it is also less risky with a limited bottom and a significantly higher monthly dividend yield. Yields from Treasury Bond ETFs are subject to federal tax, but are exempt from state and local taxes. 

**SPDR Gold Shares (GLD):**  Gold has hit an ATH without much hype and is likely to benefit from the upcoming multiple interest rate cuts.

**Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS):**  This ETF has up 20% since June and shows that money continues to flow into dominant cloud, AI, and digital infrastructure.  The price appreciation of Magnificent 7 is pointing to a supercycle that will likely lead to one of the strongest fourth quarters.

1nltilf,stocks,Indian Market Data Shows ESG Scores Flip Normal Price Discovery Rules,"Market mechanics just got weird. A recent analysis of Indian stocks shows that companies split into two trading patterns purely based on their ESG ratings:

* High ESG companies → spot market leads futures (completely backwards from normal).
* Low ESG companies → futures market leads spot (as expected).

Futures are supposed to lead because they’re cheaper and more efficient. Yet somehow, ESG flips the script.

What’s wilder: the effect isn’t uniform.

* Banking & IT → bidirectional causality, no matter the ESG score.
* Cement, oil & gas, pharma → high ESG firms drove spot-led discovery.
* FMCG & autos → low ESG firms showed futures-led dynamics.

My take: post-COVID inflows into good companies might have made spot trading hypersensitive, leaving futures lagging. For traders, it suggests that ESG leaders vs. laggards, the traditional playbook won't work.

1nlsjr7,stocks,Investment Strategy,"Hello everyone. 

Ive been investing in stocks since 2021, always had little idea what I’m doing but with this incredible bull run lately & with more hands on research & thinking from myself I’ve started to make some very good gains. 

The issue is, I’ve never had much of a strategy, I’ve just bought arbitrary amounts of certain companies if I thought they were going to do well. 

Recently I’ve decided that I should employ a strategy whereby I have 85% of my portfolio in “core” growth stocks that are relatively safe. 

Things like: GOOG, ASML, UNH. 

And another 15% in “moonshots” like ACHR, NBIS or MSTR. 

The issue is, not counting pies, I currently have 33 individual holdings and I would ideally like to get these down to 12 max.

1nlrvhd,stocks,Bears only hope remaining to maul the bulls,"I am not a bear or a bull I am bullish but alot more cautious than most and wont fomo into some of the stocks I have been watching as I know its a dangerous time when people think the market is easy.
Anyway bears have been slaughtered recently and perma bulls are making money and most people are in the delusional stage of the rally and see no way down. 
Whilst this is unlikely I can seen one major way in which the market could turn ugly, its a black swan event so unlikely but its always good to account for black swans as they have a disproportionate negative impact.
I think energy prices mainly oil and gas are low right now and thus support the fed when it comes to their expansionary monetary policy, cutting rates to boost the job market and stocks love that. However, if we were to get a supply side shock because of one of a number of reasons such as an escalating war then this would mean inflation would become rampant like in the 70s and the fed would have to raise rates or create a class war or major social unrest. At the minimum they could not cut anymore, this seems unlikely and is not a prediction but any reason for a significant spike in inflation which has already been high since Covid would be the bears last hope.
It would tank the market imo or cause some if the worse violence and social problems since 1929 and the rise if the far right.
Something like this is not likely now but in Europe or the Us I can see something like this being fairly probable in the next 3 or 4 years in an already vulnerable underlining economy.

Just to clarify not a prediction, more something to start debate on potential causes of high inflation and a stock crash or alternatively if you think there is another factor at play more likely to stop fed easing and cause a major slow down.

1nlleqw,stocks,Loaded 70% of my portfolio into BMNR how scary could dilution get?,"Just went pretty heavy on BMNR , about $7k, which is 70% of my portfolio.

I know they have that $24.5B ATM shelf open, which means they can issue more shares basically any time. Based on some modeling I did, here’s what another raise might look like:
	•	If they raise $2B at $60/share, that’s roughly 33M new shares → about 15% dilution.
	•	If price tanks to $30 and they raise $2B, that’s 66M shares → closer to 30% dilution (way worse).
	•	If price rips to $100 and they raise $2B, it’s only 7.5% dilution (pretty mild).

Historically, they tend to announce raises when share price + ETH price are strong so I’d expect the next dilution within the next 3–6 months if conditions stay favorable.

My big fear is: if they hit us with a big raise and the market sells off, this could easily drop to $55 or even $49 support levels fast.

I have a simple hypothesis that is being proven correct empirically: **Weakening dollar and overvalued US stocks will cause VSUX to outperform VTI**

Bogleheads are all too familiar with the theory 30-40% international diversification in their portfolios. But what about the rest of investors? Not including ~~degenerate~~ traders, most investors want to protect the gains from the Covid era. Looking at allocations into meaningful domestic and international index portions could be very protective, especially if you are closer to retirement.

Counterpoint: US AI growth could lead to fresh valuations and global market innovation. But I suspect that few winners will carry the lot, still resulting in broad market underperformance compared to internationals. It can't be ignored that solid international equities are much cheaper with reasonable PE relative to US hyper PE growth companies.

1nlf722,stocks,"SPT Sprout Social - Big upside move ahead, AI and Social Media","Hi everyone,

with this post I want to introduce the company Sprout Social (Nasdaq: SPT) and explain why, in my view, buying the stock could pay off over the mid to long term.

**1) About Sprout Social:**  
Sprout Social, Inc. is a U.S.-based provider of cloud software for social media management. From one central platform you can schedule and publish posts, handle comments and messages, run performance analytics, and monitor social conversations. Sprout Social serves roughly 30,000 customers in 100+ countries and is among the leaders in this space. The business model is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with recurring subscription revenue.

Sprout Social was founded in 2010 and went public in 2019. Headquarters are in Chicago, with offices in Seattle, Dublin, and Kraków, among others. The company currently employs over 1,300 people worldwide and has received multiple awards for its products and customer satisfaction (including #1 Best Software Product 2024 according to G2).

Market cap: 0.84 billion (Prior year: 1.6 billion, -47.5%)  
Revenue: 0.45 billion FY 2025 (Prior year: 0.4 billion, +12.5%)

**2) Risks (just Sprout specific, of course there are more overall)**  
\- Sprout Social still reports GAAP losses of 57 million in 2024. However, it operates profitably on a non-GAAP basis. If Sprout fails to manage costs effectively, particularly in areas like sales, marketing, and research and development, or if it cannot accelerate revenue growth, the path to full profitability may be delayed.

\- The declining market cap is a consequence of the lack of GAAP profitability and the slowdown in revenue growth over the past few months.

\- SBC: The company reports non-GAAP profits despite reporting GAAP losses due to a high amount. At least the SBC rate has remained stable: Q2/2025 reported SBC expenses of $20.2 million, which is almost unchanged from the prior year ($20.6 million). Additionally, SBC’s total expenses for the first half of 2025 were just under $40 million, compared to $38.7 million in the prior year.

**3) Opportunities**  
\- In the era of AI, data scale plays a crucial role. Sprout Social, for instance, connects to over 30 social networks and processes more than a billion messages daily. This vast data volume empowers AI to generate substantial value. Meta, X, YouTube, Reddit, and other platforms possess their own data. However, Sprout Social stands out as one of the few companies with cross-platform access. In my opinion, considering its current market capitalization, the market is significantly underestimating the potential of this data scale.

\- Social media is emerging as a lucrative growth channel for companies, prompting them to allocate increasingly larger budgets towards social media marketing. Recent surveys reveal that an impressive 80% of CMOs intend to shift their spending from traditional channels to social media, further emphasizing Sprout Social’s strategic significance.

\- Product innovation: Sprout is investing significantly in new products, particularly AI and automation, which explains the absence of GAAP profits. In 2024, Sprout introduced numerous AI-powered features, such as automatic sentiment analysis and content recommendations. In August 2025, Sprout launched a suite of new integrations, including TikTok listening, Bluesky, and an expanded Salesforce integration, to provide real-time social intelligence to customers. These rapid innovation cycles enhance Sprout’s competitive position and create customer value through efficiency gains and improved insights.

**4) Why the turnaround is likely to happen now:**  
\- Sprout Social announced in an SEC filing dated August 26, 2025, that its CEO and board members will cease their automatic stock sales and transition to purchase plans. Starting in November 2025, there will be insider buying. Looking at similar cases from the past, changing automated sale plans to automated purchase plans often leads to a lift in the share price.

Example 1, ticker ASAN:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on March 8, 2025. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +47.58% move.

Example 2, ticker PLUG:  
Change from sale to purchase plans announced on January 17, 2019. From announcement to 5 days after insider buys began: +85.71% move.

\- Sprout has been executing a strategic shift for several months. It’s moving upmarket and, instead of monthly contracts, is increasingly focusing on annual and multi-year deals. This shift has been successful, as Prout has recently won larger customers, including Zoom, Honda, the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASCAR, and more. The number of large customers (>$50k in annual spend) has grown by +44% recently.

\- I anticipate a significant positive surprise in the upcoming quarterly report. Sprout has already hinted that many existing contracts are up for renewal in the second half of the year. This could potentially lead to a major positive surprise in the upcoming Q3 numbers, as Sprout is expected to acquire new (enterprise) customers and renew many existing contracts.

Should I be checking them everyday, every week? I know trends move and money flows... I've been keeping tight numbers of whats doing good etc... I have long term investments and short term, but the short term is what I want to be watching.

Saw a post somewhere that said 15% profit on stocks are a good exit? Obviously doing this comes risk of missing a potential runner like (PLTR,NVDA) if I were to find that startup company early and selling for a short gain.

1nl7vt4,stocks,Jerome Powell on the labor market and why they chose to cut rates,"All direct quotes from the fed meeting:


“In the labor market, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3 percent in August but remains little changed over the past year at a relatively low level. Payroll job gains have slowed significantly to a pace of just 29 thousand per month over the past three months. A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation. Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the “breakeven” rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant. In addition, wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation. Overall, the marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. In our SEP, the median projection for the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent at the end of this year and edges down thereafter.
Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022 but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2 percent longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent. These readings are higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up. In contrast, disinflation appears to be continuing for services. Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal. The median projection in the SEP for total PCE inflation is 3.0 percent this year and falls to 2.6 percent in 2026 and to 2.1 percent in 2027.
Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. At today’s meeting, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4-1/4 percent and to continue reducing the size of our balance sheet.“",46,16,2025-09-19 16:14:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl7vt4/jerome_powell_on_the_labor_market_and_why_they/,2025-09-30 15:06:20.704243

> U.S. chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) has signed a letter of intent for a possible $500 million investment in the next funding round at Britain's Wayve, the autonomous driving technology group said on Thursday. The development comes after Britain and the United States signed a technology pact aimed at boosting ties in artificial intelligence and other fields.

> Wayve's technology, unlike conventional systems that rely on detailed digital maps and coding, uses machine learning with camera sensors mounted on the vehicles to learn from traffic patterns and driver behaviour.

1nl2uoj,stocks,$CDTX: H5 bird flu results are in,"Yesterday I flagged that the results from a study to evaluate in vivo efficacy of Cidara's CD388 pre-exposure prophylaxis against H5N1 (bird flu) would be presented today at the ISRV conference in Singapore. The results are now out ( [A single prophylactic dose of CD388  provides protection against highly  pathogenic bovine-origin Influenza  A virus in the ferret model](https://www.cidara.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ISRV-2025-Cidara-CD388_H5N1_Andreevl-FINAL.pdf)).  The study results were presented by Konstantin Andreev, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

**Key findings:**

This is the first in-vivo demonstration of CD388 against H5, building on prior in-vitro data.

In the ferret model (the gold standard for flu):

\***A single prophylactic dose protected against lethal H5 challenge.**

\* ≥10 mg/kg = 100% protection, with dose-response observed (3 mg/kg = 75%, 1 mg/kg = 25%).

\*Treated animals showed reduced weight loss, fewer symptoms, and no systemic spread or neuroinvasion.

\*CD388 also reduced viral shedding and cleared virus from the upper respiratory tract by Day 9.

**Why it matters:**

\*Confirms CD388’s potential as a **true pan-influenza prophylaxis**, not just seasonal.

\*Strengthens the **pandemic preparedness** story.  This is the type of data BARDA and other governments look for when deciding on stockpiling/contract awards.

\*Reinforces the idea that CD388 carries **strategic “insurance value”** on top of its seasonal high-risk market.

 

**Next milestones to watch:**

1.      End-of-Phase 2b FDA minutes (expected shortly): Looking for confirmation of an accelerated Fall ’25 Phase 3 start vs. planned spring 2026 base case.  May also confirm if Ph2b counts as pivotal, allowing for shorter phase 3. News on  Breakthrough Therapy Designation could also be included.

2.      BARDA decision on grant application.  CEO has said a decision is expected by year-end (unclear if fiscal or calendar). This is the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst.

**Bottom line:** Seasonal flu alone supports my conservative $445 (!) share rNPV. With H5 protection confirmed in vivo, CD388 is positioned not just as a seasonal prophylaxis but as a potential pandemic countermeasure, which  strengthens the case for BARDA funding and stockpiling.

1nl2mkd,stocks,"SEC to propose rule change on Trump’s call to end quarterly earnings reporting, says Chair Atkins","Paul Atkins, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, made the remarks on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Friday.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump proposed the idea that companies should no longer provide earnings reports on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead. The SEC said the agency is actively looking into that plan.

“At President Trump’s request, Chairman \[Paul\] Atkins and the SEC is prioritizing this proposal to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies,” an agency spokesperson said earlier.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed by just a majority vote on the SEC, where Republicans currently hold a 3-1 voting majority, with one open seat.

1nl1f0l,stocks,Where OpenAI's $300b deal with Oracle can come from,"I thought the $300b deal was BS when I first saw it. I now think it's real.

1. OpenAI will likely IPO. Right now, they're worth $500b in private valuation based on their last funding round. I'm willing to bet that they can IPO for $1 trillion in valuation today based on pure AI ecstasy and raise a cool $100b - $200b in cash.

2. The $300b deal starts in 2027 and runs 5 years. On average, it's $60b/year which is less than what other big AI players are spending now. Google is spending $75b in 2025. Amazon is spending $100b in 2025. Microsoft is spending $80b in 2025. Meta is spending $72b in 2025. The deal looks very reasonable from this perspective.

3. OpenAI's revenue nearly 4x'ed this year to $13b. Let's say they can 3x in 2026, that's 29b. Let's say they can 2x in 2027 (deal starts here), that's $58b. This is assuming slowing growth. I can also easily see accelerating growth for a few more years.

4. Deal with Oracle will likely be a ramp. Example: $30b in 2027. $60b in 2028. $100b in 2029. $150b in 2030. $160b in 2031. 5 years. It'll allow OpenAI to grow into it. Based on projected revenue, OpenAI will spend about ~50% of their 2027 revenue on payments to Oracle. 

Maybe everything will crash before this deal ever materializes. Maybe LLMs hit a dead end. Maybe you just hate everything AI. None of that matters. What matters is that OpenAI does have a decent chance of fulfilling the deal over a 5 year period starting in 2027 based on how things are going.

PS. Why Oracle? Because Oracle is the only cloud company that is NOT trying to compete against Nvidia so they're likely getting favors from Nvidia. Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS, and even Apple are all designing and making their own internal AI chips. Nvidia likely wants to make Oracle its main partner going forward.

tldr; OpenAI IPO can easily raise $100b+, revenue growth projections can cover Oracle payments, it's less per year than what Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta are already paying in datacenter capex in 2025.",115,56,2025-09-19 11:50:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nl1f0l/where_openais_300b_deal_with_oracle_can_come_from/,2025-09-30 15:06:20.704270

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1nksav5,stocks,UPS Has A Limited Downside From This Price,"United Parcel Service (UPS) $85

**Industry/Sector/Type –  – – Transportation/Goods/Cyclical** 

Biggest catalyst for the stock – High dividend yield and low valuation, scraping the bottom of the barrel for “value” stocks. Cautious buy, expecting a limited downside.

**Positives**

**Low Valuation:** United Parcel Service trades at a decade-low valuation of 12x earnings, which doesn’t give enough credit to its pivot from low-margin Amazon volumes towards higher-value customers. I believe that in a few years, UPS should improve operating margins significantly from the current 9% to about 12% with better paying customers.

**Healthcare logistics market:** The healthcare logistics market is estimated to grow at 9-10% to $82Bn, and UPS has plans to double revenues from this segment to $20Bn by 2026. This is a significantly higher valued market with a lot of specialized functions - storage, handling, and time-sensitive transportation, essential when you're delivering medicine, biologics, and medical devices. The $87Bn UPS has a competitive advantage over smaller carries, because it has a lot of infrastructure in place - such as temperature-controlled storage in several locations to cater this industry from clinical trials to patient deliveries. The best part of course, premium pricing. 

**Cost cutting and operational improvements:**  Here are the key points of UPS $3.5B cost reduction program:

* Reducing 20,000 jobs in 2025, across operations and management, with voluntary buyouts.
* Closing 73 facilities as part of a broader consolidation.
* Automating 64% of operations.
* 35% of reductions will come from operational roles, and 30% from Capex.
* Consolidating package routes.
* Raising revenue per piece by dropping less-profitable customers and increasing rates on retained volume

**Negatives**

**Under performer** – In the past decade the stock has lost 14%, with a very high percentage of Amazon’s business, which hurt margins. It has fallen significantly off a high of $203 from 2022. 

**Lack of forward guidance** – turnaround efforts have flattered to only deceive, two recent examples, it pulled its 2025 revenue and profit outlook in April and again withheld from providing targets in July. 

**Tariff uncertainty**  – the US-China trade being a key contributor to the lack of clarity. The demise of the de minimis exclusion of merchandise below $800 from tariffs is hurting UPS.

**Valuation**

After 15% and 4% earnings and revenues drops in 2025, I do expect UPS to return to 10-11% earnings growth and 2-4% revenue growth for the next 3 years.

A market cap of just $71Bn against $87Bn in sales is attractive. Add to that a historically low P/E of 12, and a dividend yield of 7.5%,

**High yield** – its dividend yield of 7.5% looks safe for now. **This a cautious buy.** The only caveat is that we still have a lot of trade uncertainty, and if the turnaround takes longer, this could fall even further, but I believe the downside is limited from here.",48,37,2025-09-19 03:00:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nksav5/ups_has_a_limited_downside_from_this_price/,2025-09-30 15:06:20.704310

1nkcgmg,stocks,$CDTX presenting CD388 H5 bird flu study results tomorrow,"Cidara will be presenting results from their **H5N1 (Bird Flu) study** tomorrow at the [8th AVG and 3rd IMRP 2025 Meetings - ISRV](https://www.isrv.global/featured-events/imrp-2025/) in Singapore.

Why it matters:

* **H5 is high-mortality flu** with pandemic potential.
* **CD388 has already shown in-vitro activity against H5**. Tomorrow’s readout is **in-vivo.**   If results are good, that’s additional proof of **broad, pan-influenza prophylaxis** beyond just seasonal strains.
* Governments care about (and pay for!) **pandemic preparedness**. Positive H5 data could bolster the case for BARDA stockpiling, the next potential big non-dilutive funding catalyst for Cidara.

My baseline rNPV ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/)) only accounts for seasonal high-risk cohorts in High Income Countries (HICs).

Strong H5 data increases the probability of **optional upside** :  
• Pandemic preparedness contracts (BARDA, ex-U.S. stockpiles).  
• A strong pandemic countermeasure story supports the strategic “insurance value” of CD388 and could lead to a reduction in the “skepticism discount” that seems to be currently applied to the asset.

The results won’t change my conservative base case on valuation right away, but it adds meaningful **optionality that isn’t included in my model yet**.

Therefore, the board of directors intends to propose that the repurchased shares under the program are cancelled by way of a reduction of Embracer's share capital no later than at the annual general meeting 2026.

1nk3147,stocks,$APLD DD AI Datacenters huge run from $3 --> $20 since April,"I think $APLD  deserves a proper DD. Stock has gone absolutely nuts this year and rightfully so.

# Price Action:

Back in April this thing was around $3.  
Fast forward to now and it’s sitting near $20. That’s not just meme momentum it’s tied to monster contracts and a legit buildout story. 

Notable mention:

Q4 2025 earnings call the CEO Wes Cummins confirmed that the company is in ""advanced negotiations"" with a major North American hyperscaler. (So we can assume other big contracts will be announced soon?)

# The Big Contracts:

CoreWeave (which is also backed by NVIDIA just like APLD), one of the hottest AI infra names, signed two 15-year leases worth about $7B in revenue.  
Then they exercised another 150 MW lease, bringing their total with APLD to 400 MW and raising the backlog to roughly $11B.  
This is locked-in, multi-year recurring revenue once facilities go live.

# Roadmap / Buildout (as mentioned on their official site):

480+ MW constructed in the last 18 months shows they can scale fast.  
400 MW currently under construction at Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, ND. First 100 MW goes live in Q4 2025, another 150 MW mid-2026, final 150 MW in 2027.  
1.4+ GW future pipeline already scoped out, backed by financing from Macquarie.  
Super efficient designs, direct chip cooling in collab with DELL, ND climate, PUE +-1.18, keep costs low versus their competitors.

# Energy contracts:

Secured 200 MW renewable power in Texas via TerraForm Power (Brookfield) to supply their Garden City site.  
For Polaris Forge 2 in ND, they already locked in power through Cass County Electric and Minnkota Power.  
These deals mean cheap, reliable energy the lifeblood of AI/HPC data centers. Without it, the contracts wouldn’t even be possible.

**TL:DR**

$3 in April to +-$20 now.  
$11B+ lease backlog with CoreWeave.  
480 MW built, 400 MW under construction, 1.4 GW pipeline.  
Energy supply already secured in TX and ND.  
Backed by Macquarie financing and designed for efficiency.  
  
Not financial advice. Just my DD.

By now they've gotten at/over, or very close to, 100% returns. Now some of them give dividends even if it's very little (BAC and GOOG), so it's more incentive to hold them even longer term. 

I ASSUME these companies (well most of them) will be around long enough for me to hold another 30ish years before I retire, which is currently where I'm leaning towards.....BUT that's my opinion, and I feel it'd be foolish not to take other views that I might not have thought of into account.

**Biggest catalyst for the stock** \- If interest/mortgage rates keep reducing and housing bottoms out, this could be a better way to play the housing rebound. It’s asset light, a market leader with a lot of scale and has emerged much stronger in the housing sector decline.

The great fight against inflation, which saw the Fed funds rate shoot up from 0.25% to over 5% in a short 16 months from March 22 to July 2023 felled the overbought, overpriced housing industry, which is still struggling to recover two years after its peak.

Now, they’re down 33% to 37% from that peak to just 4Mn and 625K units. **However, prices have dropped only 5% to 7% from their respective peaks and at a 6.5% mortgage rate continues to be a severe impediment to any kind of a rebound.**  
But if the housing market rebounds as housing cycles normally do with lower interest rates, I think Zillow would be a great way to take advantage of it.

**What’s positive about Zillow?**  
**Market leadership** \- dominant online buying and rental platform, with over 60% market share.  Zillow's housing app makes it the most visited real estate site in the US, with an estimated 243M Monthly unique users over its various platforms, with its engagement levels several notches above its competitors.

**Rental revenue** \- Rentals are now 25% of revenues, growing at 36%. With housing increasing unaffordable for younger cohorts, Zillow's has focused on rental demand by building a multiple listing service (MLS) on steroids. Its largest supply comes from multi-family landlords, growing at 45%. Its scale, reach and heft give it operating leverage even with lower revenue growth,  growing revenue per user and better conversion rates than smaller competitors. Zillow also gets high margin ancillary revenue from after-market services, such as title, mortgage financing, and escrow services.

**Beating the industry** \- Its For-Sale business is still growing even as new and existing home sales continue to decline.  
**Earnings growth** of over 30% expected with 14% revenue growth in the next three years.  
**Strong earnings momentum** \- beat in the first two quarters of 2025.  
**Lower mortgage rates could goose housing** \- with labor markets weakening, I believe that the 25 basis point cut is the start of declining interest rates, which would give the moribund housing industry a decent boost. I now believe that Zillow is a better long-term option than homebuilders to play housing at much lower risk.

**Zillow had wasted a significant amount of money, time and resources with its first-party home-flipping business, which they exited. Thank God! That was a disaster.**

**Negatives, challenges and risks**

**Housing cycle needs to recover** \- Poor existing, and new home sales, combined with still high prices and mortgage rates suggest that the housing cycle still has a long way to recovery.

**Stock could remain range bound** \- The stock has been on a tear gaining 44% over the last 12 months, much of the first two quarter’s earnings growth could be priced in.

**Stagnant housing market** \- A stagnant housing market has resulted in poor listing volume and even fewer transactions.

**Cyclical industry** \- It cannot escape housing cycles.

**Prices still high** \- Home prices need to drop further, they’re just 5 to 7% below the 2022 peak.

**The dispute with Compass could derail growth** \- The large real estate brokerage platform, Compass’ use of private “pocket listings,” reduces the availability of listings on Zillow’s site, attacking Zillow’s business strategy of aggregating the largest number of listings. Should this practice continue with other brokerages, the business will fragment, diminishing Zillow’s appeal as having the the largest inventory of listings.

To be sure with the 44% rally, the stock is already priced at 39x 2026 earnings, growing at 30%, with a forward PEG of 1.3, Similarly it quotes 7x 2026 sales growing at 14%. Not terrible, but no longer cheap either.

However, if housing recovers, we're still getting in close to the market trough. More importantly, Zillow has used the housing downturn to emerge stronger and gain market share at the expense of weaker rivals.

1njv8wk,stocks,Mark Zuckerberg unveils $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses,"Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display.

The glasses, which costs $799, contain a small digital display that can be controlled via hand gestures through a wristband powered by neural technology, confirming a CNBC report in August. A promotional video of the new smart glasses appeared on Meta’s YouTube page on Monday but was later removed.

The new smart glasses are a bridge between the company’s audio-only Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and the experimental Orion augmented reality glasses that the company revealed at last year’s Connect event. Orion can overlay 3D visuals over a person’s real-world field of view with the help of a wireless computing puck, but the glasses are expensive to make and not yet available to consumers.

The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses come with the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that allows users to control the device using hand gestures.

“These are glasses with the classic style that you’d expect from Ray-Ban, but they’re the first AI glasses with a high resolution display and a fully weighted Meta neural band,” Zuckerberg said.

With the new glasses, people can do tasks like watch videos through the display or see and respond to text messages, Zuckerberg said. The display doesn’t block a person’s view, and it disappears when not being used, he said.

The glasses go on sale in the U.S. on Sept. 30.

The company on Wednesday also debuted the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses, intended for athletes who participate in high-intensity sports like snowboarding and mountain biking. The Oakley-branded glasses will cost $499 when they launch on Oct. 21, making it $100 more expensive than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses that went on sale in June.

The Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses have a sportier look than the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses thanks to a wraparound design that extends its colorful lenses around a person’s temples. Unlike the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, the new model contains a button on the underside of its frames so that athletes who wear helmets can more easily capture photos and videos.

The new sports-centric smart glasses have up to nine hours of battery life, can capture 3K video and contain speakers that are louder than their predecessors. The glasses can connect with Garmin-branded fitness watches to track certain stats like their heart rates using the Meta AI assistant. Preorders start today.

Meta also debuted the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the latest version of the company’s original smart glasses. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) costs $379, up from $299 for the version released in 2023. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) has double the battery life of the previous model, lasting 8 hours on a single charge, and a more powerful camera that can capture 3K Ultra HD video. The new glasses go on sale today.

Zuckerberg also announced Horizon TV, pitching it as a way to watch television shows, sporting events and movies using the company’s Quest VR headsets. Some of Meta’s partners who will be contributing content to the app include Disney and Universal Pictures, Zuckerberg said.

>Recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. Inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.

>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.

>In support of its goals and in light of the shift in the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 to 4‑1/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.

>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Stephen I. Miran, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting.

>Along with the rate decision, officials in their closely watched “dot plot” of individual expectations pointed to two more cuts before the end of the year. The grid, however, showed a wide level of disparity, with one dot, possibly Miran’s, pointing to a total of 1.25 percentage points in additional reductions this year.

>The plot is done anonymously, with one dot for each meeting participant, but Miran has been an advocate for much lower rates. Nine of the 19 participants indicated just one more reduction this year, while 10 saw two, which would indicate moves at the October and December meetings.

1njh2bj,stocks,Lucid + Uber robotaxi deal could mark the start of a new chapter,"Lucid has been under pressure for a long time but the picture looks more interesting now.

1. Uber just invested 300 million dollars to partner with Lucid on a 20,000 unit robotaxi fleet built on the Gravity SUV platform. This is a huge validation of both Gravity and Lucid’s tech, with the first launch planned in the US next year
2. Saudi PIF backing is still solid which means financial support is not going away
3. The Gravity SUV launch on the consumer side adds another growth angle beyond the Air sedan
4. EV names often move together. Any rally in Tesla, Rivian or the sector can give Lucid a sympathy lift
5. Cost cutting has started to show up in the financials and management is working on margins
6. The reverse split has already played out and most weak holders are gone which reduces negative sentiment
7. Lucid is no longer trading like a penny stock which means bigger institutions can step in
8. Central bank policy leaning more dovish supports high growth names like Lucid by lowering funding pressure

Lucid still has risks with burn and execution but Uber’s endorsement adds credibility and institutions may look at the stock differently now.

1njfr5i,stocks,Uranium/Nuclear Equities irrationally sinking due to China 'ban' on NVIDIA's AI chips. The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

My crystal ball says uranium and nuclear will be in big demand for some time to come.",35,35,2025-09-17 15:08:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1njfr5i/uraniumnuclear_equities_irrationally_sinking_due/,2025-09-30 15:06:20.704500
1njffif,stocks,Bill Ackman Insurance acquisition TBA soon at 09/30 annual meeting?,"Previously Bill Ackman for HHH mentioned that he was looking to acquire a 1-3B+ insurance co following the model of Warren Buffett. 

It is expected that an announcement can happen at the annual meeting in a couple of weeks on Sep 30 or even announced earlier.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high(4.2B), HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.5B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

This partnership raises some interesting questions for me. for a while, the market's been obsessed with robotaxis, but the b2b robobus model seems more stable, with predictable, long-term revenue. how do we value a company focused on this niche, given that most of the public comps are in the robotaxi space?

The focus on meeting unified eu standards is also a crucial point. this could be a massive de-risking factor and a significant moat. it's a great example of regulatory arbitrage, and a company's ability to navigate these hurdles could be a huge long-term value driver. weride has global experience, including in strict markets like japan, which suggests they can clear these regulatory obstacles.

Finally, there's the ""nvidia effect"" weride is the only company in the autonomous driving field that nvidia has directly invested in. this partnership with renault provides a fundamental basis for a long-term investment thesis, moving it beyond a purely speculative ai play.

* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):** Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):** Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **GOVZ (iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF):** The most aggressive option, holding zero-coupon STRIPS. Its long duration makes it extremely sensitive to interest rate changes. It is a high-risk investment and not typically for investors seeking broad Treasury exposure.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia’s other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia’s models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker’s ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president’s state visit to the UK.

“We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,” he said. “I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it.” 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country’s homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

“The message is now loud and clear,” said an executive at one of the tech companies. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing’s progress on AI.

Beijing’s regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia’s China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China’s AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China’s chipmakers were seeking to triple the country’s total output of AI processors next year.

“The top-level consensus now is there’s going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,” said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang’s visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China’s regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia’s H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,stocks,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.’s “largest supercomputer,” with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as President Donald Trump embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant’s $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator later that year.

“I haven’t always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,” Smith said. However, he added, “I am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.”

“Just a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn’t the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,” Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday “to unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,” the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

1nipw5h,stocks,BABA is at a 4 year high,"Ahh it’s that time of year to discuss Reddit’s favorite sector: Chinese equities. 

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you’re probably pretty happy right now.

The best time to buy is when everyone says “this is Uninvestable.” For example, I think stocks like MOH and CNC could have a lot of upside, maybe some REITs like ARE or MPW have value too. 

And yes, I am well aware of the VIE structure of the BABA ADR. It is certainly a risk, but all investing comes with risk, you just need to ensure that you’re well compensated for the risk you’re taking. If it scares you, consider FXI which owns shares on the Hong Kong exchange. Full disclosure I own that too, as well as TCEHY.

The program came out of a June executive order and sets up controlled trial environments under DOT and FAA oversight. Archer will work with airlines (United is already backing them) and cities to show that its Midnight aircraft can fly quietly, safely, and at scale.

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *“landmark moment,”* while United’s CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

ACHR has already had a wild run this year (up over 150% YoY), but this adds another layer of federal legitimacy. Analysts keep slapping buy ratings with $13 PTs, even after the stock’s volatility.

**The bigger question:**

- Are we seeing the real start of urban air mobility, or is this just another news-fueled pump before a long wait on certification?

- Can these fleets actually scale like ridesharing, or will costs/noise/local politics kill it?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

1nhxe5d,stocks,EchoStar (SATS) seems massively undervalued after the $17B SpaceX deal,"I look at EchoStar (SATS), and I see something very interesting. A big thing happened and I think many people do not see the real story. I think maybe the price is too low now.

So, this company had a very big problem. It had too much debt. Like a huge credit card bill that is hard to pay. But then, they sell something very valuable. They sell their invisible highways for phone signals, what people call spectrum. First, they sell some to AT&T for $23 billion. Then, they sell more to SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, for $17 billion. That is so much money. With this money, they can pay all the debt. The big problem is gone.

The deal with SpaceX is very special. EchoStar did not just get cash. They get $8.5 billion in cash, and also an $8.5 billion piece of the SpaceX company. So now, EchoStar owns a part of SpaceX. This is very exciting, because SpaceX is growing very fast with its Starlink internet from satellites.
So what is EchoStar company now? It is not the same company it was before. Before, they were trying to build a big new 5G phone network all by themselves. This was very risky and was costing so much money. Now, they stopped that plan. The company is now more simple. It is a company that just owns a few other businesses. It is much safer now.

Think of it like a box with different toys inside. What is in the box?

First, there is the TV business, with DISH and Sling. This part is getting smaller, but it still makes a lot of money, like a cash machine.

Second, the phone business, Boost Mobile. It is smaller now and will use towers from other companies. But it will have a special new power: it will use the Starlink satellites from SpaceX so customers can get signal even in the middle of nowhere.

Third, an internet business called Hughes. This part is very stable and sells internet to government and other big companies.

Fourth, the piece of SpaceX. This is the most exciting part. It is like having a ticket for a rocket ship that is already flying to the moon. SpaceX is worth so much money, maybe $400 billion or more.

And fifth, they still have more of those invisible phone highways left to sell! One big bank said this extra part could be worth almost $10 billion. They can sell this later to a company like Verizon and get even more cash.

So, I add up all these pieces. The TV business, the phone business, the internet business, the piece of SpaceX, and the extra highways they still own. When I add it all up, I think the company is worth about $32 billion. But if you look at the stock market, the price for the whole company is only about $22 billion. This is a very big difference. It means one share of the stock could be worth maybe $110, but today it is much cheaper.

The story is simple. The company had a big debt problem. They sold some things and now the problem is gone. Now they have no debt, they have businesses that make money, and they own a piece of one of the world's most exciting companies. But the stock price is still acting like the old company with the big problem. This is why I think it is very interesting.

This is just my idea, of course, not advice. I am very interested to hear what you think. Am I missing something?

1nhsho4,stocks,Are tech stocks the new consumer staples?,"During the last few recessions, investors were always running to consumer staples like WMT, PG, MCD, KO, PEP, because tech stocks were too risky to hold and they always crashed hard.

This is the first time tech stocks are actually going up during a recession while consumer staples are going down. People are addicted to technology and they would rather go to a food bank than cancel their Netflix subscription.

Some of the tech companies are literally becoming consumers staples or even utilities, and people can't imagine living without them.

1nhozun,stocks,How do I (27M) convince my dad (68M) to stop gambling on individual stocks?,"My dad comfortably retired around 13 years ago from a good business he owned. He was able to build a strong nest egg to coast through retirement easily, even if he just kept it in lower-interest assets yielding 3-4% per annum.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

TLDR;

Dad lost most of retirement savings from risky assets, has a $1.6 million loan to repay.",250,243,2025-09-15 15:28:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhozun/how_do_i_27m_convince_my_dad_68m_to_stop_gambling/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630723

1nhof8h,stocks,"LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk, high reward biotech stock","Hello r/stocks I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

⸻

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking “What did I just read?” I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia – More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

⸻

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

⸻

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor’s efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don’t have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

⸻

Possible Growth:

	•Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	•Target population of the US is 128 million people

	•A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	•The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

⸻

Company Financial Health: Good

	•Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	•Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	•This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

⸻

So we have a lot of potential here but let’s not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

⸻

Major Risks to Consider:

	•They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	•They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	•I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	•It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	•The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	•Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	•Short Interest is 30% – it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

⸻

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

1nhnjwm,stocks,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President Donald Trump floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is “subject to SEC approval” and would “save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.”

“Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!’” Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018 op-ed piece for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

“In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

1nhmzq8,stocks,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust ruling by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.

But Judge Amit Mehta decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated the company and called it “a very good day.”

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google’s IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the creation of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai’s latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up helping Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company’s hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google’s flagship suite of AI models.

1ngvvff,stocks,Why Par Technology Corp is a LT Buy.,"Hey Everyone,

I came across this company while reading a partnership letter of an asset management firm that allocates capital in various securities. Naturally, I was curious to learn more about it, and low and behold, it was severely undervalued with great underlying economics and management that has made decisions that have kept the company alive and is positioning itself for the future very well.

For background PAR started as a defense company and made its way into the food industry firstly offering hardware solutions, like POS items, and in the last seven years undergoing a rapid transformation into a more cloud based solutions within the food industry. The security is undervalued due to net losses in the last seven years, this is because of the rapid transformation of the company into a primary software solutions provider, which has included many acqustions to position the company to offer a unified experience from Point of sale, to payements, to commerce. Hence in recent years the company has under gone volitality from the market, yet is is important to not net loss has dramtically reduced from around 70 million in 2023 to just 5 million net loss in 24, this aligns with strong revenue growth, year over year. Management has proved that it can adapt with the moving times something that kills great companies like Kodak as a major example. (Or perhaps severely weaken their market share.) I am acknowledging that saying that profitability in the near future is speculation, but all trends point in that way. (I will attach a summary of financials below.)

The balance sheet is strong as well as assets fully outweigh liablities and the assets include the companies they acquired equating to the goodwill, and 200 million in cash as well.

They also have great business advantages, primarily the fact that companies face high switching costs once they integrate. This is more relevant than ever since PAR is offering unified experiences. This can somewhat be applied with pricing power as well.

The margin of safety is there, although it is rather hard to make predictions for growth, even conservatively, the margin of safety is quite large, i have bought at 44 a share.

1ngvaz4,stocks,Hennessy funds recommends these top 3 small caps to become GIANTS,"Josh Wein, a VP & key 5 star portfolio manager of Hennessy Funds, who manages 10 of the funds worth collectively 3B in AUM, recently mentioned that these 3 top small caps are his favorite to become giants.

**$ROOT insurance:**

ROOT insurance is an insurance company with a 1.5B market-cap that underwrites risk utilizing AI targeting safe drivers, which allows them to have less risk & better profit margins than their legacy peers. ROOT although small, has been beating legacy insurers on all metrics all around, including pricing, loss ratios, and a forward efficient tech stack. ROOT has recently partnered with the biggest names in auto including Toyota, Hyundai, CVNA, Experian, etc, which now sports 20+ major partners strong, and many more to come. Their partnership channel has been growing at 3x YoY, and you quickly realize why Josh thinks ROOT could end up being a giant one day.

**$COMP**

Compass is a tech forward real estate brokerage. the thesis is that if interest rates drop, that real estate volume will pick back up. Josh also sees similarities to Redfin where another company can come in to acquire compass for synergies. Their profit margins are higher than other brokers, due to the tech support that compass provides to their agents. Compass has 33,000+ agents.

**$WMK Weis Markets Inc**

Weis Markets operates a chain of supermarkets with over 200 stores. Currently has a 1.75B market cap. Currently runs at a 17.64 P/E. has steady growth in assets, revenue, and offers a dividend. The thought behind this, is buying Weis in thoughts of it becoming the next Walmart. Though, growth hasn't been strong enough to support the thesis.

are there any other small caps that you would suggest other than what Wein has recommended?",0,14,2025-09-14 16:11:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngvaz4/hennessy_funds_recommends_these_top_3_small_caps/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630817
1nguqsy,stocks,SES S.A. $SESG Stock Thoughts?,"Yo so I was digging around random tickers and ended up on SES S.A. (ticker SESG) – barely anyone here ever talks about it 🤷‍♂️.

It’s basically a Luxembourg-based satellite outfit running the Astra satellites + O3b stuff. What’s kinda dope is they’re not just GEO like the old guys but also got a MEO constellation, so the latency’s lower and coverage’s wider than some of the newer LEO kids.

Money-wise it’s a bit of a mixed bag tbh. Revenues are in the billions € but profits are meh. They just finished buying Intelsat which could be a huge deal if they don’t mess up the integration. Dividend’s juicy at \~7% but obviously that comes with risk – heavy capex, debt, Starlink breathing down their neck etc.

Anyway, I’m personally thinking of opening a small position for the dividend and to see how the Intelsat integration goes. Not financial advice, DYOR.",6,4,2025-09-14 15:50:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nguqsy/ses_sa_sesg_stock_thoughts/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630823
1ngujqq,stocks,Mag 7: exposure to AI downside,"Hi everyone,

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun’s take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

Thank you!

P.S.: My current Mag7 top pick for the medium-long term is Alphabet.",87,83,2025-09-14 15:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngujqq/mag_7_exposure_to_ai_downside/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630828

1ngogkq,stocks,Stock buybacks--Why are they happening and what do they imply for regular investors?,"I just saw that companies are buying back their own stock at a record pace, and this activity represented 6 times the volume of households buying in the market in 2024.  This is mind-blowing, and I can see a few ways to take it.  Also, I might be missing the point or the info might be misleading.  For example, how did they count my money managed by Vanguard or whoever in my 401k?

1-It could mean that the companies think their own stocks are drastically undervalued, and that might imply that despite measures like P/E ratio sending us the signal that the market is overvalued, the people in the know see it differently.  However, counter-intuitively, the chart I found showed that buybacks were lowest in the 2008 crash and the covid drop.  Those are the times that the companies' management should have seen their stocks as undervalued.  Maybe they were too focused on survival at that point to find the cash for buybacks(?) 

2-It could imply that they are using the buyback strategy as a substitute for investing in the future of their companies.  Perhaps they are trying to get the price up to catch a bonus, to increase the value of their own holdings, or just to give shareholders good feelings about their management as they see the price go up.

3-It could imply that the managers of these companies see few opportunities for investment, and they are just 'circling the airport', waiting for opportunities to come along in the future.  Maybe this could mean that a crash is likely in the near future.

Am I correct to think that today's levels of buybacks are unprecedented?  What is driving them?  What do they imply that rational individual investors should do in response, if anything?",12,98,2025-09-14 11:06:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngogkq/stock_buybackswhy_are_they_happening_and_what_do/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630839

1nfl6jr,stocks,My thoughts on PAR.,"Hey Everyone,

So i have been looking for undervalued securities, and often you find investement ideas in niche places, from value line, to barrons, to in my case a interview with a founder of a asset management firm. The founder brought up PAR, and naturally my curiosity spiked, i went to check out the company as of now. This is will be pretty unformal so please bare with. The company has been loosing money as of late, which has relativley been the main factor in poor investor sentiment, and the whole reason the company is so undervalued in the first place. They have been loosing money primarily, because they are agressivley trying to acquire market share. PAR is a technology company that offers solutions to food businesses out of while tropical cafe and arbys are customers. I like this business because i know there are naturally high switching costs, and pricing power is strong. They have collectivley acquired different businesses from payments to commerce to really provide a unified expeirience to customers. Management competency is pretty high, Savneet Singh is the CEO and is track record is respectable to say the least. And i since the current price is at the 52 week low, it seems foolish not to put a shitload in the business, i see a long term oppurtunity, conservative dcf calculations seem to predict 10 year share prices of 110 of course this will vary individual to indiviual. So yeah for me PAR is a strong strong buy.

1nfj3ri,stocks,Why I’m selling $RDDT even though I think it has great growth potential,"(Purely on vibes, no fundamental analysis)

I bought RDDT at IPO and have been holding, because I believed in the company, and still believe that it’s a well run company with a good strategy for growth/monetization.

However, the Trump administration is putting their hands all over corporate America, and almost every large corporation is following the White House’s bidding, because no one wants to be on the wrong side of a fight with the entire federal government. Anyone that goes against the President could be faced with lawsuits, loss of contracts, having mergers/acquisitions blocked, etc. Look at how many concessions Paramount had to give the White House before their merger could be approved!

After the Charlie Kirk assassination, the American right-wing is PISSED, and swearing vengeance against “the violent left.” High ranking officials, including the President himself, are promising to root out left wing ideas. They’ve already organized extremely fast to get people and organizations investigated, suspended, and fired - https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare

Reddit is the highest profile left-leaning social media. Multiple high profile conservatives are already angry about the highly upvoted posts that are sympathetic to the killing. Just look at the most upvoted posts yesterday on any default sub.

I think it will only be a matter of time before this sentiment about Reddit reaches the White House, and they will force Reddit to adopt changes that are favorable to the administration, such as shutting down certain subreddits, overhauling the moderation strategy, or even demanding sensitive details about certain users. If Reddit abides, it could severely impact Reddit’s growth strategy as left-leaning users find other platforms. If Reddit refuses, the administration will pursue many options to punish Reddit, like tying it up in lawsuits or preventing other companies from doing business with Reddit.

Either way, this should significantly affect Reddit stock price.

Could I be wrong and then RDDT runs up some more? Of course, but I’m already up 450% and won’t lose any sleep from selling it.",0,31,2025-09-13 00:06:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfj3ri/why_im_selling_rddt_even_though_i_think_it_has/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630913
1nfgpnp,stocks,Finally leaving Robinhood after a decade,"I was part of the original batch of users when Robinhood was first teased online. Back then zero commission trading was unheard of. As a 21 year old trying to buy Tesla, logging into Scotttrade and paying commissions every single time felt like a huge barrier. Robinhood completely changed that and honestly changed the whole industry for the better.

But the app today feels very different. It has turned into a so called “super app” that constantly pushes Gold, nags you to roll over retirement accounts, and adds features that feel more like gambling than investing. The contract trading section especially just seems predatory.

I stuck with Robinhood through everything. I was not even mad during the GameStop Citadel mess when trading was locked. I defended them and even made YouTube videos back in the day recommending Robinhood to beginners.

This morning I finally moved everything to Fidelity with an ACATS transfer. I also signed up for their 2 percent cash back credit card and will funnel the rewards into index funds. At this point it just feels like the smarter move for where I am now.

Not trying to convince anyone, but after nearly a decade it feels like closing a chapter. Maybe I just grew up.


Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect so many Robinhood fans to chime in. To be clear, I was a fan too! The app just doesn’t sit right with me anymore. I’m not doing anything fancy like options these days. I’m a pretty passive investor now, mainly just buying two companies through my brokerage since my other accounts are already handling the index fund side. Really appreciate all the perspectives though. And yeah, I have to admit the Fidelity app and website feel a little old school, but hey… at least it’s better than Vanguard’s lol.",503,288,2025-09-12 22:19:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfgpnp/finally_leaving_robinhood_after_a_decade/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630923

The report from the Washington Post said officials plan to include the claim in a presentation next week to a key vaccine panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That committee plays a critical role in determining vaccine access, as it reviews immunization data and makes recommendations on who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other duties. But the presentation to that panel is not final, the Post reported. “FDA and CDC staff routinely analyze VAERS and other safety monitoring data, and those reviews are being shared publicly through the established ACIP process,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, referring to the panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “Until that is shared publicly, any this should be considered pure speculation,” the spokesperson added.

> Pfizer’s stock fell more than 3% on Friday, while shares of Moderna dropped more than 7%. Novavax, which creates protein-based Covid shots, slid more than 4%. The report comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. moves to change vaccine policy in the U.S. He has dropped Covid shot recommendations for healthy kids and pregnant women and set new limits on the approval of new jabs against the virus. In a statement, Moderna said the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored” by the company, the FDA and regulators in more than 90 countries. Systems across the U.S., Australia, Canada and Europe have not identified “any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women,” Moderna added.",934,166,2025-09-12 21:51:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfg181/pfizer_moderna_shares_fall_on_report_that_trump/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630932

You can participate in IPOs but they have an anti-flipping rule that if you sell it within 15 days you get a 180 day ban from participating in IPOs the first time, and if you do it again you get a 1 year ban. Kind of annoying since if they were serious about IPO flipping they would just outright prohibit you from doing it. Also, presumably institutions and higher-level traders don't have those types of restrictions, so it's really a penalty to disadvantage retail traders.

1nfa1qo,stocks,Follow-up: Why flu vaccine economics shouldn’t apply to Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 universal flu prophylaxis,"In response to my earlier post asking if Cidara’s (CDTX) CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” was the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market ([CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndt2go/cdtx_is_their_cd388_universal_flu_prophylaxis_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), I received a number of comments that begged the question:  Why should CD388 be priced any differently than flu vaccines?

This question is worthy of a deeper dive to explain why I think why vaccine economics should not apply to CD388:

1. CD388 isn’t a vaccine! It **doesn’t depend on the immune system**, so what this means in practical terms is that **it will work** just as **well for people that have weakened immune systems**, like the elderly, cancer patients, or people with other diseases that suppress immune function, as it will for healthy people.
2. CD388 is **flu strain agnostic**, whereas vaccines need to be reformulated yearly in the hopes of matching the most active strains.  For folks with weakened immune systems and at high risk of complications from the flu, the seasonal uncertainty of protection from vaccines translates to risk, and this risk translates to lifestyle changes (like wearing a mask and staying home) that have a serious impact on quality of life.
3. **CD388 works pretty much right away**, whereas it generally takes a couple of weeks for healthy immune systems to build up immunity after exposure to a vaccine.  This means people most at risk will be able to be confident that they’re protected soon after receiving CD388 and will stay protected through the flu season.
4. The effect of **CD388 is additive to vaccines**!  In terms of protecting the most at-risk population, this means that vaccines and CD388 can be used together to maximize protection against disease.

The key point here is that if the effectiveness of CD388 demonstrated in Cidara's 5000+ person-strong phase 2b holds for their phase 3 trial, they will have a drug that, for the population for which the flu disease burden is highest (i.e., where there is higher risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death), is far more effective than available flu vaccines.   Not only more effective, but additive to current vaccines.  Vaccines alone don’t deliver this same benefit to this population and so don't have the same value – economic or otherwise.  That’s why the company believes that a mAb prophylaxis like Beyfortus, not a flu vaccine, is a better reference for CD388 pricing.

Although I only included this high risk population in my original TAM calculation, the fact that CD388 is pan-influenza and applicable to H5 (Bird flu) strains, and that it works near-instantly, makes it an obvious candidate as a medical countermeasure for pandemic preparedness.   There is no doubt that stockpiling at scale for the masses would drive a different pricing regime, consistent with the volumes that can be expected for such stockpiles.  I excluded this “icing on the cake” from my previous analysis, however, simply because the numbers just leave me shaking my head in disbelief! I’ll leave that analysis for when and if BARDA gives us a hint of what that stockpiling might be worth.

Bottom line, I am still looking for the definitive answer to my original question: Is Cidara's CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market?  Some of the feedback I’ve received suggest that its current discount reflects its development stage, but my valuation math already considers a measured probability of success (or failure).   Does a 60%-80% discount on top of my already risk-managed rNPV really make sense?

For discussion only. This is a question, and not investment advice! I hold shares of $CDTX.",9,11,2025-09-12 17:55:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nfa1qo/followup_why_flu_vaccine_economics_shouldnt_apply/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.630973

* Oracle announces $455B in RPOs through 2030, driving stock up 40% in a single day
* $300B of this (66%) depends on a single contract with OpenAI starting in 2027
* OpenAI's funding for this contract comes from SoftBank's $500B Stargate commitment
* SoftBank's total assets are $300B - meaning they'd need to liquidate their entire company just for the Oracle deal
* This is the same SoftBank that valued WeWork at $47B then watched it collapse, promised $108B for Vision Fund 2 but only raised $56B, and has a 30+ year track record of overpromising and underdelivering
* SoftBank funding is contingent on OpenAI converting from a nonprofit to a for-profit, which California AG is investigating and could require a $30B+ payment
* Even if all this works out, Oracle's RPO delivery doesn't start until 2027 - giving 2+ years for this house of cards to collapse
* Oracle's current market cap surge assumes a company with $168B in assets and under $15B in Q1 2025 revenue will somehow deploy $800B+ across multiple AI infrastructure commitments

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Now, Nasdaq itself wants in, asking regulators to approve rule changes so tokenized stocks can trade alongside traditional ones, under the same conditions. That’s a massive shift in narrative: Wall Street isn’t just watching RWA anymore, it wants to own it.

So here’s the open question:

If Wall Street starts pushing tokenized equities and bonds, will crypto platforms that pioneered these products (like Bitget with its RWA index futures) still have an edge?

Or will the traditional markets simply absorb the idea and leave Web3 players behind?

1nes68a,stocks,"OpenAI, ORCL, NVDA and the UK","The question has to be asked, who is funding OpenAI moving forward? 

$300 billion to Oracle. Projected cash burn through 2029 is $115 billion (as of a few days ago). And now this comes out:   OPENAI, NVIDIA TO ANNOUNCE BILLIONS IN UK DATA CENTER PROJECTS

So that lands them in the realm of needing maybe $500+ billion in the next 4 years? They don’t make money, they burn money, so it’s not coming out of pocket. Maybe they go public and aim for a 1 trillion starting valuation? I know there are changes with their MSFT deal happening right now, not sure if listing is on the table. Or is the US government just giving them a blank check? None of these options seem overly likely.

$ wise none of this adds up, and it’s really starting to look like a giant scam to me. Yes ai has great uses, yes it is not going anywhere. But it’s also not profitable, at all. Not even close. All of the mega caps are burning huge amounts of money getting this all set up, with the plan to monetize it down the road. META had its panic moment when they started overpaying to poach talent, probably because they realized that llm’s hit a wall that would result in ai not being as profitable as projected. 

I think we may be in the stage where all companies start lying about future capex and revenue streams. At this point they have to. Just look at NVDA, renting back its own products lol, clever, but not actually a good thing. 

If the mega caps admit they need to scale back the ai roll out or drastically extend the timelines to complete these data center projects, then bye bye stock price. But it is hard for public companies to just straight up lie. OpenAI has less public eyeballs on their books. Can they really afford all of this? They are saying they can, and ORCL had an amazing day thanks to that. So maybe that is the play now. As the music gets closer to stopping, we will see more and more projects get announced from OpenAI and possibly some of the other non-publicly traded ai companies. 

These lies buy the industry time, which will allow the publicly traded companies to do offerings, maybe sell some stock, and just generally prepare for the coming market downturn. In turn, they agree to support the companies that are helping them fake these expansion / future revenue numbers right now. Because when the ball drops, and the capex bonfire is still burning hot, it’s going to get ugly. 

When will this finally fall apart? Who knows. Maybe 3 months. Maybe 1 year. Maybe 2 years if the government drops rates to zero and hands out blank checks to all ai companies. But it will hit, and it won’t be pretty.

WASHINGTON (AP) - In another grim sign for the U.S. labor market, jobless claim applications jumped to their highest level in almost four years last week, virtually assuring the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next week.

The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.3 percent in August (SA); up 3.1 percent over the year (NSA).""

The expected inflation, combined with an increasingly weak job market, sets the stage for the expected next week's Fed interest rate cut. There was a 92% chance of a 25 bp cut and 8% chance of a 50 bp cut prior to this morning's CPI report.

Wall Street is looking forward to a more aggressive trajectory of rate cuts alongside the slowing jobs market.  A growing number of economists now forecast a quarter-point rate cut at each of this year’s three remaining meetings, instead of just two cuts. 

""The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, after rising 0.2 percent in July, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 2.9 percent before seasonal adjustment.

The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in August and was the largest factor in the all items monthly increase. The food index increased 0.5 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 0.6 percent and the food away from home index increased 0.3 percent. The index for energy rose 0.7 percent in August as the index for gasoline increased 1.9 percent over the month.

The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.3 percent in August, as it did in July.

1ne09jg,stocks,"$BYRN DD: It's Mispriced, and I think it'll pop by October 8th. I'll prove it.","**TL;DR: I believe $BYRN will pop off on or before their earnings call on October 8th.** Shorts are trying to convince you that a company with 57% revenue growth and frankly explosive profits is a bad bet. They are wrong.


    Standard play: $BYRN shares currently $19-20;
    
    Budget play 1: 10/17 25c currently ~$0.65;
    
    Budget play 2: 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80. 


\---------------------------------------------------

In 2023, I started value investing again. Responsibly. Just a bit. And long story short, I found BYRN. I've been holding it since it was $4. After their 2025 first quarter earnings, they spiked to around $34, where I took profits. But then the stock sank. And sank some more. For no reason. So I bought back. And so should you.

Disclaimer: I couldn't post this in WSB because BYRN is at $475mm market cap and doesn't meet the $500mm minimum requirement. Hopefully tomorrow I can post there too.

---
- *Quick rundown of Byrna.  It's a nonlethal gun (""launcher"") company that gained attention after Google banned them from advertising on their platforms in 2023 for promoting violence. Ironic. Police departments worldwide are using it now, and the Streisand effect is gaining them more and more contracts. Their CMRO is genuinely goated, most recently securing a deal with Sportsman's Warehouse to have in-store Byrna demo rooms. It's been a massive success, as you'll see below. They have*  ***zero debt and positive income***.

---

Seriously though, there's like literally no reason it's being suppressed at $20. I have reason to believe there's some bullshittery happening here. Here I shall present to you my thesis on their October 8th earnings call. Fun fact, I typed this entire thing myself. No AI.

So you're doubtful? Nah bruh. LOOK at the

###Fundamentals:

**Tariff resistance stats:** 100% ammo production in the USA. 92% launcher production in the USA.

**Q1 2025 vs. Q1 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $26.2 million (57% increase from $16.7 million)
    Gross Profit: $15.9 million (61% of revenue)
    Net Income: $1.7 million (9900% increase from $17,000)

**Q2 2025 vs. Q2 2024**:

    Net Revenue: $28.5 million (41% increase from $20.3 million)
    Gross Profit: $17.6 million (62% of revenue)
    Net Income: $2.4 million (14% increase from $2.1 million)


**Q3 2025 vs. Q3 2024 (Preliminary)**:

    Net Revenue: $28.2 million (35% increase from $20.9 million)
     - Driven by a 147% increase in chain store and dealer channels (wtf)
    Web sales increased by 8%.
    International sales grew by 33%.

Like please. In one of the most turbulent economic chapters in US history, BYRN is STILL ramping its sales and margins. And yet, the stock is hovering around $20. My best guess is, your average retail investor isn't who is shorting it. It's someone else. Possibly a hedge fund, because 66% of BYRN is owned by institutional investors who don't give enough of a shit to short it.

I've been tracking this stock for 2 years now. People are catching on. Remember, these guys were trading at $4 in 2023. Every single one of their C level execs is amazing. Analyst price targets are between $35 and $46. The company is officially profitable, and income is consistently in the black. But the stock is marooned at $20. I couldn't make sense of it, because I don't like conspiracy theories. But it kept happening. For MONTHS.

###The Short ""Interest""

Yeah, we're a bit allergic to the term ""shorts"" these days. I get it. But... I have to call it out. Because as of August 15th, the short interest on BYRN was 4.08 million shares, or 23.1% of the total float. ***Nearly a quarter of the company’s publicly traded shares are being shorted.***

##***23.1% short interest on a profitable, zero debt company.*** WHAT.

> **They use AI in their marketing...**

- The target market for the AI ads are boomers who shop at Sportsman’s Warehouse. They can’t tell the difference between AI and a real video, and they don’t care. I literally sent my parents the video and asked them what was wrong with it. My mom said ""it was a wonderful ad, very clever"". Bullish.

> **The economy is uncertain...**

- BYRN is nearly immune to tariffs. See Tariff Resist Stats above. The fact that the stock moves on tariff news is honestly dumb as heck, but we live in the world of algos now. Bullish, but also I'm a bit pissed about this.

> **They're burning cash...**

- Yep. New product release (Byrna CL), they're burning cash to stockpile and advertise it. And they're still in the black. AND it’s working. Gotta spend money to make money. Bullish.


The preliminary earnings for Q3 are already out, and they are fantastic. The only thing left to be revealed in October is the EPS, and I’m betting 30k shares that it’s going to be another profitable quarter.

Why am I writing this all out? Because I want someone else other than me to be interested in this. BYRN is an obviously overlooked company. I rode the wave from $4 without saying a word and waiting for talking heads from Yahoo.com to spread the news. But lately I've been thinking, there's a big value play here, and it's happening because somebody with a lot of money somewhere made a mistake and needs time to unload. I'm expecting it to run up to somewhere from $35-$45. Am I crazy? Can someone stop me because I want to throw 100% of my portfolio into this baddie. I'm actually simping for this company so hard its crazy.

###Plays to take advantage of this (I did all 3):

1. 10/17 25c currently ~$0.60-$0.90

2. Buy the stock. Currently hovering between $19-$21

3. 12/19 30c currently ~$0.80 (less risky play)


Thank you regards for reading this far. The same fundamentals as any other slept-on stock applies to this one. Buy and hold, check the next interest report coming out on 09/15, etcetera. If any oldheads read this post, please fact check my ass. I'm trying to navigate this into as much profit as I can possibly take myself.

1ndyrdb,stocks,"$SOUN, $OPEN, $RR","Been watching on $SOUN, $OPEN, $RR for a while. I’ve got a few things to point out:

**$SOUN** provides voice enabled platforms for cars, restaurants, and customer support. They sell voice solutions to businesses. It’s still early stage and not fully profitable, but the growth potential is there.

**$OPEN** is a tech driven home buying and selling company. They give homeowners instant cash offers, flip houses, and offer extra services like title and escrow. Their revenue swings a lot with housing market cycles and management moves.

**$RR** makes service robots for hospitality, restaurants, warehouses, and cleaning. Some robots handle drinks, deliveries, or cleaning, basically taking over repetitive human tasks. Deployment is growing, but profitability is still in the early stages.

All three companies are using technology or systems to replace or streamline traditional processes. None of them are rock solid profitable yet, so stock swings can be wild. News, market sentiment, or sector trends can make big moves in either direction. Their solutions have large potential markets. Voice platforms can be scaled across industries, Opendoor targets the massive US housing market, and RR’s robots can be applied wherever service humans are needed.

Of course, there are risks, costs are high (development, deployment, maintenance), market adoption isn’t guaranteed, competition is fierce, and management/operational risks exist (e.g., OPEN had CEO changes recently).

So, yeah, they're not the same companies, but they are all future, AI + automation or robotics. Could be fun to watch if you'd like speculative trades,  but don't be fooled, they are not low risk.

1ndye8q,stocks,Vanguard vs Robinhood - should I switch?,"I am an 18 year old with a pretty good amount of money saved up. Right now, I have nearly all of my funds in VTSAX. I am on the verge of transferring my funds to robinhood on a 2% transfer deal they have right now (I’d make the maximum 500 dollars from that). I also do know to keep the 500 dollars, I’d have to hold my money in Robinhood for 5 years, which I don’t really plan on taking money out anyway.

In Robinhood, I’d probably just hold VTI because they do not have VTSAX, and I feel like one huge advantage to this is being able to buy IPOs when they release, as they seem to be constantly doubling these days. Also, Robinhood makes it significantly easier to sell and buy shares of stock.

Also, robinhood allows me to trade with like 100k margin or something crazy along those lines. Would it not just be smart to throw that in an index fund?",0,48,2025-09-11 03:25:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndye8q/vanguard_vs_robinhood_should_i_switch/,2025-09-30 15:06:22.631188

1ndt2go,stocks,"CDTX – Is their CD388 “universal flu prophylaxis” the most undervalued clinical-stage blockbuster on the market, or I am missing something?","New to reddit and looking for a second set of eyes on one of my investments.

I’ve been digging into Cidara ($CDTX), which is developing CD388, a once-per-season prophylaxis for influenza. Essentially a “universal flu med” for high-risk groups (elderly, immunocompromised, diabetics) where vaccines don't work well. It recently came out of a large phase 2b trial with ""game-changer"" efficacy results and will soon be moving on to phase 3.

Share price today: ~$63/share × ~42M FD shares (fully diluted) = ~$2.7B valuation.

Note: It perked up a bit today (and promptly settled back down), I suspect because the company mentioned yesterday to investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference that they were very happy with how their end of phase 2b meeting with the FDA in August went. Also, their phase 3, which was supposed to start in the spring 2026, is now posted on clinicaltrials.gov as starting this fall. No official PR from Cidara yet, but it seems some good news is coming.

Anyway, here's my math on valuation (conservative inputs):

TAM for CD388: ~285M high-risk in WHO high-income countries (CDC/WHO data, overlap-adjusted). I am extrapolating from the company's US-only data because it seems silly to think a universal flu drug that works well and is safe will only sell in the US.

Pricing: Anchored to long-acting prophylactics (like Beyfortus RSV mAb), not cheap antivirals. U.S. ~$495/dose, ex-U.S. ~$225 → ~$280 weighted avg. (company has done market research and projects confidence that payers will cover at these price points. The ex. US assumption is my own, but follows typical patters of 50% reduction outside US).

COGS: ~$70/dose (figure mentioned by CFO in recent presentation, better as they scale production) → ~75% gross margin. Net margin assumed at 25% (in line with biologics).

Uptake: 25% peak (~71M treated). For context: flu vaccine coverage = ~45% of U.S. adults, ~70% of seniors. So 25% feels skeptical, not aggressive. I more realistic number would be to match vaccine uptake in this high-risk population, but I'm trying to keep this conservative.

Valuation (rNPV): Launch 2028 (potential timing for approval also mentioned by CEO in above conference), patent to 2039, biosimilar erosion by 2042. Discount 10%, PoS 75%. Outcome = ~$22B NPV → $445–530/share!

That's a big number for a clinical stage biotech, but this is a universal flu play! And Cidara is also a platform play with an oncology med based on the same DFC platform waiting in the wings, so maybe it should at least get some optionality out of that.

So my question: why the disconnect?

Is it just “clinical-stage biotech = high risk” until Phase 3 reads out?

Are institutions deliberately keeping this quiet until they’re positioned? (huge institutional interest vs. small free retail float)

Is the market over-discounting dilution, competition, or BARDA uncertainty?

From where I sit, the numbers look like 7–8× upside, but the stock sits flat at $62-$64.

Curious to hear from this community: what am I missing? Why does the market price CD388 so conservatively when even cautious rNPV with risk levers turned up points so much higher?

1ndkcue,stocks,WeRide – Quietly Crushing the Autonomous Driving Game,"Alright, let’s talk about a ticker nobody’s giving enough love: WeRide ($WRD).

Yeah, their earnings were 2 months ago, but sometimes you gotta let the hype die down and actually look at the numbers. And holy hell, these guys are quietly building one of the strongest plays in autonomous driving.

Q2 ‘25 Recap:

* Total revenue hit $17.8M, up 60% YoY.
* Robotaxi revenue exploded +836% YoY to $6.4M. That’s now over a third of their total business – it’s not a “pilot program” anymore, it’s a legit revenue driver.
* Gross profit climbed 40% YoY, with gross margin sitting pretty at 28%. Scaling AND getting more efficient. Most of their competitors can’t say that.
* They dropped HPC 3.0, running on NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor. This isn’t just marketing fluff – it cuts system cost in half while keeping it fully automotive-grade. Lower costs + better scalability = every fleet rollout becomes more profitable.
* Market Cap still only 2.7 Billion - potential 10x in coming years

Global footprint (bigger than most people realize):

* Abu Dhabi: robotaxi fleet tripled since Dec ‘24. Over 2,200 days of safe ops – regulators love that.
* Saudi Arabia: first company to run robotaxis in Riyadh. Major flex in the Middle East.
* Singapur: First operating autonomous vehicle without a safety driver in South-East Asia
* Permits in 6 countries.
* Uber and Grab partnership: the real kicker. WeRide’s tech is getting plugged into Uber’s and Grab's ecosystems, with plans for 15 cities outside US/China in the next 5 years. Uber also tossed in a $100M investment.

People sleep on this – WeRide isn’t just pushing one product. They’ve got:

* Robotaxis (obviously)
* Robobusses
* Robovans (autonomous logistics/delivery)
* Robosweepers (city sanitation, already deployed)
* Other mobility/transport solutions, all running on the WeRide One Platform.

That means multiple revenue streams across mobility + logistics + smart city services. They’re building an ecosystem.

Look, the stock isn’t mooning *yet*. They’re still in growth mode, and yes, net income is red. But think about it: massive YoY growth, global ops scaling, partnerships with Uber, Grab, Lenovo and NVIDIA, and a diversified portfolio. Compare that to the other AV players stuck in testing loops or bleeding cash without a clear roadmap.

This is how a long game looks – grab market share, get permits, build trust with regulators, diversify products, line up big-name partners, and then ride the revenue curve.

TL;DR  
2 months after earnings and I’m still hyped:

* Revenue up 60%, robotaxi rev up 836%.
* NVIDIA-powered HPC 3.0 = cheaper, faster scaling.
* Global expansion (Abu Dhabi, Saudi, Singapur, 6 permits worldwide).
* Uber deal with $100M backing.
* Broad product lineup beyond taxis.

I’m not saying it’s going 10x overnight, but this smells like a sleeper growth stock that’ll sneak up on everyone. While the herd chases Tesla and Waymo FSD headlines, WeRide is quietly racking up cities, fleets, and partnerships.",29,13,2025-09-10 17:18:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndkcue/weride_quietly_crushing_the_autonomous_driving/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324308

The cloud giant is on pace for its best day since 1999, and is now quickly approaching the $1 trillion market cap benchmark

The company said it has $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.

“This is a very historic kind of print right here from Oracle with this backlog,” Ben Reitzes, technology research head at Melius Research, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “The Street was looking for about $180 billion in RPO and they’re talking about a number that is a multiple of that. That is astounding.”

Oracle now sees $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, with the company calling for the annual sum to reach $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.

Other analysts were left “blown away” and “in shock.” D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria called it “absolutely staggering on CNBC’s “Fast Money.” Wells Fargo analysts said it was a “momentous confirmation” of the artificial intelligence trade.

1ndeclp,stocks,Broadcom Cements Its AI Credentials,"**Broadcom (AVGO) $342**

I first bought Broadcom more than a year ago for $150, and added more yesterday around $340, deciding to take the plunge after holding on and realizing that the price wouldn’t come down.

Broadcom (AVGO) the second largest AI chipmaker, and the leader by far in custom GPUs, and datacenter networking gear declared July quarter results that just passed estimates by a whisker.

The stock, however, rallied massively the next day as the ebullient CEO, Hock Tan talked up a massive $110Bn backlog , a new $10Bn customer and an expanding TAM for custom silicon and datacenter networking.

**The quarterly results and guidance at a glance**

* Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.69 beat by $0.03.
* Revenue of $15.95Bn (+22.0% YoY) beat by $130Mn. Broadcom’s revenue growth rest on two pillars, AI 32% and VMware 36% of sales, so an overall 22% growth is  excellent for the company.
* Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7Bn, with a 67% margin.
* A massive cash haul of 7.2Bn less Capex of just $142Mn, gave it an FCF of $7 Bn or 44% of revenue – **Very impressive.**

**Guidance was also close to estimates on supply constraints.**

The good stuff came during the earnings call, which was much more illuminating; CEO Hock Tan was very enthused about AI prospects, and talked about sufficiently faster growth and a massive backlog of $110Bn, plus he confirmed adding a new customer, rumored to be OpenAI.

This is one company and CEO, I respect tremendously. Hock Tan whose tenure was extended to 2030 by the board always talks up a big game; more importantly he delivers like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Arista Networks', Jayshree Ullal. 

**From Broadcom’s Q3 Earnings call:**

>

**Broadcom’s strengths and positive catalysts**

**AI revenue share keeps rising:** The share of AI revenue has gone up to an estimated 32-33% of FY2025 sales from 24% last year and based on management’s confidence in Ethernet and custom silicon scale ups and scale outs it should grow to $34Bn in FY2026, or 43% of sales and $56Bn in FY2027 or 61% of total sales. Broadcom’s sales and earnings multiples expand with each percentage increase of AI in the total mix.

**Ethernet can increase market share:** Management believes that hyperscalers prefer Ethernet “as one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up,” and Broadcom’s Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs can continue to grow and gain datacenter connectivity share over competitors like Nvidia, Arista Networks and Marvell.

**High margin SaaS continues to grow:** VMware continues to be a pillar of strength, with 17% high margin revenue growth. Besides, Broadcom is positioning VMware as an integrated AI solution with custom silicon.

**Strong margins:** Broadcom has strong 37% adjusted operating and 44% operating cash flow margins.

**Increasing TAM:** Previously, management had indicated that FY2026 AI revenue growth might be similar to FY2025 (roughly +50–60% YoY). But now, with the addition of a fourth hyperscaler, Broadcom’s 2026’s AI growth to “accelerate” beyond that rate, likely between 60 and 70%. The new $10Bn+ XPU customer has moved to production for AI server racks with shipments scheduled to begin in Q3 FY2026. This deal suggests several million custom AI chips could be delivered, aimed at AI inference workloads, which is the next big frontier as it takes over from training, and cements Broadcom as one of the biggest and preferred inference players.  Inference requires significantly more tokenization than training, which means hyperscalers will have to continue investing, to continue getting higher throughput at lower costs, which is key to Broadcom’s success. The $110Bn backlog that Tan spoke of confirms that this demand is much higher than anticipated.

**Broadcom’s biggest challenge is valuation, 20x FY2026 sales growing at 22%, leaves it with little room for error. It is priced to perfection.**",29,8,2025-09-10 13:33:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ndeclp/broadcom_cements_its_ai_credentials/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324469

1nd8ojp,stocks,Investing in (the rise of retail) investing?,"Hello again!

Three months ago I made a reddit thread about Investing in Escapism. I took my observations as a gen Z living in SEA and I had good discussions in the previous thread with people sharing their experience and what industries/stocks might benefit from escapism.

My initial bets were: Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (700), and Meta. They're all doing well and I even added RDDT into my portfolio due to that thread, it's up over 100% now (sadly I haven't bought much of it yet).

I was still exploring into industries like BNPL which are really popular in poorer SEA countries (in Thailand where I live, the government warns that people are using BNPL to pay for food and groceries), and traveling (one redditor raised traveling as another thing to look out for, and from my observation it seems most Gen Z's seem to travel a lot, I see people taking a trip to Japan. I even plan one myself later this year). I ruled out Gaming and Alcoholism. (There was RBLX mentioned too, and it's been doing well this year)  
  
While I was thinking about Escapism, It hit me that I, too, am one of the target demographic. There is a raising trend about Gen Z who take their finances much more seriously than previous generations. Crypto, trading, stocks are becoming common words. I started investing back when I was 22-23, now I'm 28 and it's changed my life trajectory massively. There are probably many who are also doing this. a gen Z investor/customer will mean a lifetime of commission/fees if a service can make them stick long term.

I'm not familiar with all the financial service or other non-stock space. My initial thought is obviously my broker: IBKR. I've been using their service since 2021 and I'm very happy with them. They have lower fees and global reach for both markets and clients. The financial knowledge in the US is likely the highest of the world, all the cheapest index funds and competitive brokerages are over there. I think the rest of the world will slowly catch up, which could mean positive outlook for IBKR who's positioned to benefit the most from the rise of retail investing (outside of maybe S&P 500 itself due to all the money flowing over there). Coinbase is another that comes to my mind but I haven't looked into it.

I want to hear your thoughts. Which stocks or industries do you think will directly or indirectly benefit the most from the rise of retail investing?

Brent crude futures settled 37 cents, or 0.6%, higher at $66.39 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also climbed 37 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $62.63 a barrel.

Both benchmarks had gained almost 2% shortly after the Israeli attack on Qatar, but gave up the majority of those gains later as the United States assured Doha that such a thing would not happen again on its soil.

""Both the U.S. and Qatar have made it clear they are not seeking further escalation, while the muted reaction from other (Gulf Cooperation Council) members reinforces the view that the risk of a wider regional flare-up remains contained,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.""

For now, geopolitical risk premiums are easing rather than building,"" Leon said.

Oil prices also pared some gains because the attack did not create any immediate supply disruption, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.

The oil benchmarks were trading higher prior to the attack on Qatar, supported by the latest oil output increase from OPEC+ being smaller than anticipated, expectations that China will continue stockpiling oil and concerns over potential new sanctions against Russia.",30,1,2025-09-10 07:32:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd7rzv/oil_settles_higher_after_israeli_attack_on_qatar/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324554

1nd1djr,stocks,Nebius Moves To The Big Leagues,"**The $17.4Bn to $19.4Bn Nebius - Microsoft Deal**

NBIS ($96)

**This is a tremendous deal for Nebius.**

My investment thesis for Nebius was based on its technical/engineering strengths as a medium sized Neocloud provider democratizing AI infrastructure for medium sized businesses who did not want or need to pay exorbitant fees to AWS or the other hyperscalers. Prior to this deal, its biggest customer was Shopify and it was well on its way to expanding its reach to companies at, or below Shopify’s size.

**Nebius' competitive advantages:** Its biggest strengths lie in its full software stack, honed by decades of engineering talent from the ex Yandex team, instead of being a brute provider of GPU‘s in scale like Coreweave, which meant that it had the competitive advantage of not being sucked into lower pricing from just renting out GPUs. It could command a higher price and margin than other Neocloud providers, by focusing more on providing a platform and a superior stack of solutions, plus its customers were supposed to be smaller, giving it more bargaining power. Its second competitive advantage is its strategic relationship with Nvidia, which allows it to commit and guarantee computing power, the way it did with Microsoft. It has the GPUs and the datacenter infrastructure to ensure that there are no supply constraints or bottlenecks.

**Excellent Return On Investment**: Prior to this deal, its estimated sales growth was $0.6Bn in 2025, growing to $9Bn by 2030, and my target was 8X sales or a market cap of $72Bn, which was about 5x the market cap of $15Bn it was selling at till yesterday - so an almost 5x return over 5 years or 37% per year. **Pretty hefty.**

**Even better ROI:** A deal of $18Bn at mid-point clearly changes these estimates and I’m conservatively forecasting the six year deal adds at least $2Bn to revenue each year. And of course, they will get growth from other clients, a massive deal like this gives them even more cachet - my revised sales target for 2030 is $13.5Bn, valuing Nebius at 10x sales = $135Bn. CEO, Arkady Volozh calls this just the beginning, and so far he has walked the talk. At $135Bn we could be looking at almost 7x the current market cap of $22.6Bn (at a price of$95), or a return of 42% per year.

**Need to raise capital:** They will need to raise at least $3-5Bn in the next 2-3 years from both debt and equity, to play in the majors, but what’s also amazing is that they are financing this with Microsoft’s cash and credit, which means the dilution/interest payments will not be that high. Nebius still comes out way ahead with another 30% increase in share count, if needed at this price. Coreweave has $7.5 billion in long-term debt with about $7 billion in sales in 2025 with around $30 billion worth of contracts, and their growth trajectory confirms that capital raises are absolutely necessary for Neoclouds to thrive. 

**Adding more shares:** I was very content to hold and even sold off some in the mid-sixties after getting 2.6x my purchase price of $23, but now I think the stock is still worth buying even though it has shot up 45% in a day, considering where this company could go in the next five years. This deal actually validates my original thesis and I have no qualms about pyramiding (adding smaller quantities) to my holding.  
**To be sure, this increases the risks and challenges, namely execution, reduction in AI demand, enhanced competition, and dilution, but I think the risks are worth it.**",59,27,2025-09-10 01:37:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nd1djr/nebius_moves_to_the_big_leagues/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324708

i keep hearing that a very large recession is seemingly bound and very likely to happen extremely soon. I know it’s impossible to predict the market and all, but the warning signs are there, right?

  
would it be a feasible option for me to hold onto this cash and put it in something that grows the money in value over a short amount of time just until the recession happens, and then buy as much as I can through DCA as the market is low?

1nctxgv,stocks,Oracle pops 13% on growth projections even as earnings miss estimates,"Oracle shares spiked 15% in extended trading on Tuesday after the database software maker indicated hefty growth prospects even as earnings and revenue missed estimates.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** $1.47 adjusted vs. $1.48 expected
* **Revenue:** $14.93 billion vs. $15.04 billion expected

Revenue increased 12% from a year earlier during the quarter, which ended on Aug. 31, according to a statement. Net income was about flat at $2.93 billion, or $1.01 per share, compared to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter last year.

Oracle said its remaining performance obligation, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been contracted, now stands at $455 billion, up some 359% from a year earlier. During the quarter OpenAI said it signed an agreement with Oracle to develop 4.5 gigawatts of U.S. data center capacity.

Alongside larger cloud providers such as Microsoft, Oracle has been one of the big winners of the AI boom, due to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) needed for large workloads. CEO Safra Catz said in the statement that the company signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in the quarter.

Also in the quarter, Oracle said cloud rival Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence models would become available on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure.

Oracle shares hit a record last month and are up 45% in 2025 as of Tuesday’s close, while the S&P 500 index has gained 11%.

> U.S. employers added far fewer jobs in 2024 and early 2025 than previously thought, indicating the labor market may have been significantly weaker than initial estimates had suggested. The U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months ending in March than previously estimated, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Tuesday. The figure, which exceeded economists' expectations, appears to be the largest revision ever recorded. The preliminary estimate will be finalized next year. The revision, a routine step in the compilation of government labor statistics, assesses monthly survey estimates alongside state unemployment data.

Trump claimed without evidence that McEntarfer had manipulated statistics for political reasons.

I asked her for the phone number of the man who's been helping her sell it. She gave me a fake number. This was the first red flag. So I did some research and apparently, there is supposed to be a legend on the back of a stock certificate. The back of mine is completely blank. The front names the company, the amount of shares, and their value. The second red flag is that, if her shares are valued at the same as mine are, there is no way she has been able to receive as much money as she has. She has no other streams of income.

Sarepta stock is down almost 90% due to two deaths related to its flagship gene therapy, Elevidys. It’s an expensive but highly unique solution to give children suffering from DMD a chance at a better life. 

They got in a pissing match with an FDA official, and long story short, it’s still ongoing but in a detente. They have huge political support, as well as support from families of the kids suffering from this. The FDA pulled their therapy, yet shortly after, put it back on the market. 

There is no other solution for kids suffering from DMD, and nothing in the near or medium term either. If they can continue to keep their drug on the market and if they’re allowed to sell it to non-ambulatory patients again (perhaps in conjunction with some liver-protecting drugs) the stock could potentially go back to triple digits. However, there is also a chance that it goes to $0 if their drug is permanently pulled for everyone (small chance, but not zero).",8,11,2025-09-09 15:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nclmnh/srpt_binary_outcome/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324895
1ncj0ng,stocks,"Why are all EVTOLs posts focusing on Joby/Archer, while EH seems at least as promising, if not better ?","Every week there are new threads on this sub trying to pump Archer, and occasionally Joby, but I feel like the discourse here completely overlooks EHang, which is to me a much safer bet for the following reasons 


**1. First to Market, first to revenue**

While Joby and Archer are still in the FAA certification process, EHang has already achieved its equivalent in China. They hold the Type Certificate, Production Certificate, and a standard Airworthiness Certificate from the CAAC for their EH216-S model. It has allowed them to be the first in the world to launch commercial, passenger-carrying eVTOL operations. EHang has a full year of revenue-generating flights under its belt and what appears to be a growing order book. Joby and Archer, for all their progress, are still effectively pre-revenue companies on the passenger side. To me, this is a considerable edge over them, as they actually have something on the market now. 

**2. A much more favourable environment**

EHang operates in a region that is actively championing the growth of the ""low-altitude economy."" The Chinese government and various local municipalities are partnering with EHang, providing financial support and, most importantly, a clear and streamlined regulatory pathway. This contrasts sharply with the challenges in the United States and Europe, where there are way more regulatory roadblock, NIMBY sentiments, and a general mindset that is more cautious towards new technologies. 

In my opinion, this is crucial, as if you really think about it, the current certifications hurdles are just the start for Western companies, as building the infrastructure for EVTOLs will definitely be met with a lot of resistance, flight routes will be considered a disturbance for the locals and will struggle to receive approvals, and the development might be extremely slowed down because of it, independently of the actual viability of the vehicles.

**3. A more pragmatic approach**

Personally, I think EHang’s strategy of starting with a simpler, two-seater, autonomous vehicle has paid off quite well. It allowed them to achieve certification and commercialization far earlier. A key point for me is that their platform was designed to be autonomous from day one, which I believe is the ultimate endgame for this industry in terms of operational efficiency and scalability. It also gives credibility to their ambitions when it comes to longer range vehicles. 

Their VT-35 will be able to fly 300km, and is already well into its certification process with the CAAC. They have a partnership with the city of Hefei to establish a comprehensive product hub for the VT-35, involving a joint investment of approximately 1 billion RMB, covering R&D, testing, manufacturing, and the entire certification process, significantly accelerating the model's industrialization.

They're also making variants of their EH216 model for other applications such as logistics and firefighting. 

**4. Tangible growth and expansion**

It's also clear that EHang's ambitions are not confined to its domestic market. Over the past year, they've solidified partnerships in the UAE, Southeast Asia, and parts of Europe, moving from demonstration flights to laying the groundwork for international sales and operations. This suggests a clear and aggressive growth strategy.

**5. The massive valuation disconnect**

EHang's market cap is hovering around $1 billion. Compare that to Archer at ~$5.5 billion and Joby at ~$11.5 billion.

To me, there is a massive valuation gap. It looks to me like the market is pricing Joby and Archer for near-perfect future execution, while seemingly discounting EHang's very real, present-day achievements. It makes the risk/reward much more attractive ofr EH.

**Conclusion: A safer bet on a very speculative sector**

As I see it, investing in Joby and Archer rely on a lot of uncertain event to go rights, starting from the certification, to the viability of the mass production, whether the piloted model can be viable or not (it's not an uber, you won't get away with paying pilots peanuts, so this makes the commercial viability more challenging as costs will be higher), the need to manage the roadblocks to the required infrastructure development, NIMBY blocking flight routes, safety concerns of the customers, etc. EVTOLs might succeed, but it's definitely a tough road ahead.

With EHang, I feel like you're investing in a company that has already proven its model. They have a certified product, established manufacturing, growing revenue, and a supportive domestic market. When factoring in that you're getting all this for a fraction of its competitors market caps, I find it hard to justify picking them over EH at the moment.

To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people will react with the usual ""China is uninvestable"" discourse, but I feel like it makes very little sense in this case, as the usual risks associated with Chinese stocks are very minor compared to the huge risk that such speculative investments represent in the first place. Even if you want to discount the stock a bit for it, it should at least be in the conversation when discussing EVTOLs companies.

1ncin8g,stocks,(09/9) Interesting Stocks Today - The Real Winner of Succession is...,"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Murdoch’s $3.3 Billion Succession Deal Hands Lachlan Control](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-08/murdoch-family-settles-suit-over-trust-puts-lachlan-in-charge?srnd=homepage-americas)

[**NBIS (Nebius)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NBIS&p=d)\- Nebius said it signed a multibillion‑dollar agreement to provide Microsoft with artificial intelligence infrastructure. Ultimately spiked up to $110 yesterday and made a MASSIVE move afterhours, I'm primarily interested in seeing if we can continue that today. Watching $100 level. The Neocloud providers like Nebius (and CoreWeave) are benefiting from AI compute demand, and big tech is signaling that the AI party is continuing for now, overall a bullish sign for compute companies.

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d) **/** [**FIGR (Figure)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIGR&p=d)\- FIGR IPO has been upsized, so CRCL has reacted positively to the news, I'm currently watching both leading up to the IPO of FIGR. Does this have as much potential as CRCL? I'd say no, but I think that it is an interesting watch. The surge of crypto‑industry IPOs sparked by Circle’s $1.05 B listing has been part of the IPO market coming back. FIGR is aiming for an IPO that is half its size, and is decently profitable. Planning to write a DD on this. Main risk in this is that we get absolutely euphoric (we're already very euphoric in the IPO market lol).

[**FOX (Fox Corp)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FOX&p=d)\- Lachlan Murdoch has won the game of Succession and the stock has drifted somewhat lower on this news-but it was done on such little volume we’ll have to wait until the market opens to see if FOX will stay down 5%.

[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)\- Day 2 of being added (or at least, notifying everyone it will be added) to the S&P 500! primarily interested in if it can continue the momentum and break ATH (\~$117/\~117.70). TLDR stocks go up when added to the S&P 500 because index‑tracking funds and ETFs are forced to buy in.

1ncf2fd,stocks,"Share that one stock that everybody seems to hate, but you like","To me, it is $SNAP

Everybody is saying the same things about it. The CEO sucks, they have flopped many products, they can't monetize in the way that other social media giants can. But the reason I believe it's a good purchase: It’s survived wave after wave of “this app is dead” & still the userbase is growing year after year.

Snapchat is growing year-over-year, with a 7% increase in global monthly active users (MAU) to 932 million and a 9% increase in daily active users (DAU) to 469 million in Q2 2025.

This makes it very interesting for acquisitions by e.g. Meta or Google - or simply a complete overhaul of the monetization done by money hungry consultancy firms such as Mckinsey or Deloitte.

Besides, they currently already have increased profit quarter after quarter. They could even keep improving with the current set-up.

And the cherry on top: it's currently trading at an all time low.

It has the potential to grow slowly in the current states, but it could also increase exponentially with exciting developments in the future.

Should you allocate 50% of your portfolio? No. But a small position can't hurt, in my opinion.

1ncdql0,stocks,Thoughts on SpaceX's acquisition of Echostar,"In the realm of satellite communications, the most critical and scarce resource is frequency; orbital resources, by contrast, are abundant.

Among the foreign D2C satellite constellations, the only one that can truly compete with Starlink is ASTS, which is backed by numerous telecommunications operators. The others are merely dabbling.

ASTS has three relative advantages.

First, it has a large number of partner operators. Once its satellite network is complete, its services can be rolled out faster and more broadly.

Second, it has more frequency resources. Currently, most mobile communication frequencies are held by operators. With more partners, ASTS clearly has an advantage in this area. On a lighter note, ASTS once tested on a frequency band partially allocated to amateur radio enthusiasts, which drew protests from the amateur community. ASTS claimed their tests proved there would be no negative impact on others, but the FCC didn't buy their story and swiftly issued a clear order prohibiting ASTS from using that band.

Third, its satellites are more advanced, boasting the world's largest satellite communications array (223 square meters).

However, Starlink has now aggressively secured the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block frequency bands with its financial power, significantly diminishing ASTS's frequency advantage.

On the other hand, ASTS is facing delays in its network deployment. Only five BlueBird-1 satellites (the first generation, with a 64-square-meter array) are currently in operation. The manufacturing and launch progress of BlueBird-2 is far behind schedule. In contrast, Starlink has already deployed over 600 of its first-generation D2C satellites and has launched D2C data services via an app on select phones. Its next-generation D2C satellites are rumored to have thousands of directional beams, increasing communication capacity by 20-fold. ASTS's technological lead is shrinking, and the manufacturing and launch costs of BlueBird-2 are far higher than Starlink's. Even with a technical edge, it cannot compete with Starlink on a cost-performance basis.

Starlink's dominance in the D2C constellation market is becoming more solidified, and there is a possibility that operators who once backed ASTS could switch sides.

However, Starlink's D2C service still faces potential challenges.

Most existing mobile phones do not support the AWS-4 and PCS H-Block bands. To use these frequencies in the future, cooperation from handset manufacturers is required. Among these, Apple's stance is the most critical, and Apple has always had a poor relationship with SpaceX. Apple has been planning for D2C service for a long time, with its main satellite partner being Globalstar. It launched ""Emergency SOS via Satellite"" in 2022. However, Globalstar is still a traditional, old-school aerospace company, where delays and high costs are commonplace, and its network deployment is slow (a classic case of ""starting early but finishing late,"" which has become a traditional skill for Apple). When Starlink and T-Mobile launched their D2C service, Apple's response was not very enthusiastic. Although the iPhone series eventually enabled the service, its rollout was slower than that of Samsung and other phone manufacturers.

The future will depend on whether SpaceX and Apple can reconcile. If Apple remains stubborn and opposes SpaceX at the risk of losing money and alienating operators (a small but existing possibility), there isn't much SpaceX can do. As for the idea that SpaceX or Tesla would manufacture their own phones, it's best to take that with a grain of salt.

There is also speculation that SpaceX might enter the market directly and become a mobile communications operator itself. This scenario is also unlikely. SpaceX still holds too few frequency licenses. Becoming an operator involves a very cumbersome process of approvals and qualifications. Partnering with existing operators remains the best option.

Finally, while the D2C market is a ""blue ocean,"" how large is it really?

Starlink's terminal service has already been a great success because there is a huge market for broadband services in remote areas abroad. Capturing this market segment is enough to be profitable. At the same time, Starlink is also planning to compete in the fiber-to-the-home market. At the same technological level, satellite communication cannot compete with fiber optics in densely populated areas. But the reality is that competition is never based on an equivalent level of technology. The quality of home fiber service providers in Europe and America varies greatly, whereas Starlink is the leader among satellite service providers. It's like the saying: ""My average horse is weaker than yours, but my best horse is stronger than your mid-tier horse."" Therefore, SpaceX is actively preparing for Starlink V3 and the next-generation gigabit home terminal to compete with home fiber.

However, the D2C market may not be as large. The standard Starlink terminal service in the US costs about $100 per month. The monthly fee for D2C is only $10. Revenue from Starlink terminal users is expected to exceed $10 billion this year. If D2C service is priced at $10 per month, with operators taking half, reaching a similar revenue scale of $10 billion would require 160 million users. Achieving such a user base is very difficult.

The situation for mobile phones is different from that of fiber optics. No matter how poor the cell towers are, in densely populated areas, D2C can never compete with terrestrial base stations. Starlink terminals can compete with fiber by using large phased-array antennas and high-frequency, wide-bandwidth satellite communication bands. If the speed isn't enough, they can increase the terminal's array size and add more frequency bands. Mobile phones are limited by their size; the antenna's size and power cannot be increased significantly, and acquiring new frequency bands is an arduous battle for every 10 MHz due to operator monopolies.

D2C is a supplementary solution, meant to cover areas without cell tower signals. Elon Musk has also emphasized this in his speeches. If you disagree, you can argue with him on X. Some might say that technology will evolve and D2C will one day surpass base stations. But terrestrial base stations and ground networks are not standing still; they are also advancing. Furthermore, building a D2C satellite network is not cheap. Because phone antennas are small and their performance is limited, the satellites themselves must have higher performance (which is why ASTS is developing a 223-square-meter array), naturally leading to higher costs.

Therefore, D2C is a future development trend, and major operators, phone manufacturers, and satellite companies are all positioning themselves in this space. D2C constellations are emerging one after another, and a winner at the hundred-billion-dollar level might appear. However, the market size is ultimately limited. We should neither dismiss it as useless nor praise it blindly.",35,35,2025-09-09 08:54:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ncdql0/thoughts_on_spacexs_acquisition_of_echostar/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324949

1nbwetv,stocks,Respectfully: Why on earth should I invest *long term* (10+ yrs) into a MAG7?,"So - don't get me wrong: I believe you likely will not lose any money in the long run. You'll even make quite a lot. But what I am asking myself:


I read a lot about people who spend all their money on Google or Nvidia for the money to have doubled in 10 years. Sounds good - but 10 years is REALLY long and it has a risk of failure that the company gets into trouble and the stock goes sideways instead of up.
Why should I invest into e.g. Nvidia in the *long term* meaning 10+ years? Yes, the stock can grow 10% in a short period of time, and maybe double or triple over the whole time, but why shouldn't I sell earlier and realize my winnings I already have? Then I can invest into something else that might grow a little more in a shorter time frame, and so on. This could create more wealth in a shorter time. And I don't mean WSB-like trading here. More like ""read news every day and look in my depot every week"".


I understand that this might be about safety when investing into single stocks (MAG7 will very unlikely vanish). But IF I want safety, why not use an ETF exclusively? Yes, this has less revenue, but: When I invest in the short term, worst case is that it dips first, goes sideways, and sooner or later goes up (hopefully) - it becomes an unwilling long-term hold. When I invest in the long term, worst case is that just when I need it, the stock did just plummet. I make myself dependent on THIS single company.


Do you understand what I mean? I cannot wrap my head around this really. And what explicitly makes me think is that I am currently +20% with Google and think about cashing out. On the other hand, I think Google could still grow quite a lot within a shorter time frame (2-3 years).",0,90,2025-09-08 18:54:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbwetv/respectfully_why_on_earth_should_i_invest_long/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324961

> Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he is “confident” that President Donald Trump’s tariff plan “will win” at the Supreme Court, but warned his agency would be forced to issue massive refunds if the high court rules against it.
> 
> If the tariffs are struck down, he said, “we would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” according to an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
> 
> He added, however, that “if the court says it, we’d have to do it.”
> 
> The Trump administration last week asked the Supreme Court for an “expedited ruling” to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs on imports from other countries are illegal.
> 
> Generally, the Supreme Court could take as long as early next summer to issue a decision on the legality of Trump’s tariffs.
> 
> Bessent has said that “delaying a ruling until June 2026 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion in tariffs have already been collected, and unwinding them could cause significant disruption.”
> 
> The prospect of the government having to refund tariffs of that magnitude could mean an unprecedented windfall to the businesses and entities that paid them.

Not sure how likely this is with SCOTUS but the last time Bessent ""warned"" what would happen if their tariffs were voided they lost in the appeals court decision. 

So this could be another signal that they aren't confident in the legality of about half of these tariffs implemented so far (regardless of him saying he's confident)

I'm curious about what companies will be the biggest winners if they are forced to give tariff refunds. I believe the Section 232 tariffs implemented so far will stay in effect, since the appeals court ruling covers tariffs under IEEPA. So this would mainly impact the retaliatory tariffs levied against every country",1489,215,2025-09-08 15:03:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbq5q9/treasury_secretary_bessent_warns_of_massive/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.324986

1nbm7b3,stocks,"Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services. How real is this shift?","Running most of our workloads on AWS and Azure right now, but I've seen a lot of headlines saying companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services due to security and sovereignty concerns. I've looked at OVHcloud and Deutsche Telekom's offerings but the scale and feayures seem way behind the big US players. Has anyone seen serious movement from large enterprises actually migrating off the big three?

1nbm4tr,stocks,Motley called Archer a no-brainer industrial pick. Good things all around for the stock,"In their September 5 report, AOL labeled Archer Aviation as one of two industrial stocks worth considering right now, and for good reason

Although still early stage, Archer’s push into electric vertical takeoff and landing technology is planting the seeds for a fundamentally new way to navigate urban airspace. The kind of energy around Archer isn't coming from hype, it's rooted in real momentum, industrial innovation backed by big-name partners, solid funding, and a clear path toward commercialization

The fact that someone is calling it a “no-brainer” reflects growing recognition that Archer’s mission to elevate mobility isn't some distant fantasy, it’s steadily becoming reality

Between ambitious certification timelines, manufacturing ramp-ups, and smart investments across the commercial and defense side of aviation, Archer is building a narrative that feels increasingly credible and compelling. 
It’s not just about flying taxis, it’s the transformation of urban and regional travel. That feels worth paying attention to, and keeping a positive lens on as we ride this story forward

1nbc2vz,stocks,"Perpetua Resources is Being Added to the S&P/TSX as of Sept 22, 2025 (Materials, Gold)","[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/p-dow-jones-indices-announces-211500983.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/p-dow-jones-indices-announces-211500983.html)

If you recall, PPTA is on the verge of getting their final permits signed off. As well as gold, the property holds enough Antimony to supply up to 37% of the USA's requirements. America does not produce any Antimony, and it is *critical* for national defense munitions manufacture. No military bullets can be made without antimony. China has banned its export to the USA, and no, it is not a rare earth metal and so that ban has not been lifted. The antimony will get the mine built, the gold will make the money. The Company in a web presentation has stated that it will sell antimony concentrate created during the gold production to offset that production, making it the lowest cost gold producer in the USA, as well as the largest privately owned gold mine. All finances are in place for getting this started up (500M recently raised), and there is a 2B ExIm loan in the works already.

They only have one real permit left to get (I'm pretty sure, if not it is a dubious second). And that one permit has it's public comment period by the Idaho DEQ ending on Sept 8 (this Monday). After that there is some time to address the comments. I'm not sure of the timing but somewhere soon it goes into a draft permit if there are no significant issues. Given the federal permits take years to address, I'm thinking it's close (EDIT: i.e. all the big questions have been resolved with the federal permits and the state permits are much quicker to resolve). The company in one of their recent updates think it should be any time now. They have already stated that they are ready to present the go forward plan to shareholders anytime the permit(s?) complete which they expected in the summer. Likely production/refining by 2029.

**Look for this from June on YouTube (this sub doesn't allow YouTube links): ""Webinar: Perpetua Resources Unlocking the Stibnite Gold Project"".** It's the best overview out there. Also there are monthly updates on their site. Their projected share price in that was based on gold being $3000/oz is $38/share and $50/share at $3500/oz. If you've noticed, gold is climbing above 3600 and likely to go higher. Some speculate that gold will reach 5K in the next few years. And this is based on the current reserves they are about to open. But in fact there is high likelihood that there is nearly double that on their property, based on past exploratory drilling.

The only pain point is the the Nez Pierce tribe filing constant lawsuits. However I don't think any have stuck so far and they seem to be along the same vein. They're trying another one now but I think the counter argument to sink it is, why did you wait till now, this just seems like some blocking/delaying action. And many of their members want the mine for the jobs. They are trying to cause pain to block it, but simply put the mine is too important to the USA not to go forward.

More importantly is the fact that the mine is of significant strategic interest to the United States. Critical strategic interest in fact. Personally I think it is a done deal. It was on Biden's list to get built, Trump's top ten list, the DoD funded much of the permitting work, etc. That's my $0.02. As one should always do, do your own homework. :) Cheers.",22,3,2025-09-08 02:32:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nbc2vz/perpetua_resources_is_being_added_to_the_sptsx_as/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325050
1nb2fdy,stocks,"ASML becomes Mistral AI’s top shareholder after leading latest funding round, sources say","ASML, a crucial supplier of advanced chipmaking equipment, is set to become the top shareholder of French artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI in a move to strengthen European tech sovereignty, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The Dutch ASML is committing 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for Mistral’s 1.7 billion euro (\~$2 billion) fundraise and is expected to get a board seat at Mistral, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.

The round will make Mistral the most valuable AI company in Europe with a 10-billion-euro ($11.7 billion) pre-money valuation in its latest Series C funding round, the people said.

ASML declined to comment. Mistral did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

1nazqw0,stocks,"The Weak Payroll Report Of Only 22,000 jobs Is Bad For The Market And The Economy","**S&P 500 recovery on 09/5/225:** I believe that the S&P 500's recovery from the day’s low to close just 0.2% down, after a weak payrolls report of 22,000 only net new jobs in August is a perverse reaction anticipating lower interest rates, and is incorrect. 

**Bad news is bad news:** Yes, the 10 year rallied from 4.17% to close at 4.08%, boosting the S&P 500 from the day's low, but weak jobs report confirms a 4 month trend of a softening labor market, it's not a flash in a pan. Further, I don’t see any catalysts for this trend reversing. The average four month payroll growth is now just 25,000, as compared to 185,000 in the same period last year, and 186,000 in 2024. And excluding the pandemic, this is the weakest monthly job creation since 2010. 

**A reliable job sector is showing weakness:** Worse, job creation in non cyclical sectors such as elder care, healthcare, government and municipal services has slowed signifying real barriers to employment growth. Healthcare jobs have always been the growth engine and a reliable one in an aging population, thus the slowdown in this sector is foreboding. Employment in health care and social assistance rose by about 47,000 in August. That’s the smallest monthly increase since January 2022. It’s arguably a big warning sign for the wider labor market given the sector has accounted for more than 40% of all new jobs over the last three years. 

**Non-Farm payrolls was not the only sign** – The JOLTS report showed slowdowns in job openings, unemployment claims have gone up and continuing claims remain high indicating that its getting tougher to find jobs.

**What can the rate cuts do and not do?**

It helps lower the 10-year treasury yield as we saw on Friday, which in turn will reduce mortgage rates and commercial business rates.

It will help housing the most, and ease financial conditions for commercial construction and business, but this will take time to filter through.

It does not directly help job creation

It will inflate assets, especially stocks, which is dangerous.

**Avoid the FOMO and BTD impulses:** Don’t jump in because the Fed will cut in September – that’s already priced in. The Fed will cut rates of at least 25 basis points, possibly 50 at the September 17 meeting, but cuts will take time to impact growth. **What’s not priced in is a weakening economy and a much needed correction in an expensive market.** Don’t chase the rally just on lower interest rates, instead understand that a weak labor market can nudge the country into a recession. To be sure, there has never been a recession with unemployment rates below 6%, and at 4.4% there are no alarm bells, but we’re trudging in the wrong direction. Trade policy uncertainties, AI productivity improvements and DOGE cuts are taking their toll on the economy. Rate cuts may briefly lift valuations,  but you need fundamental improvements to sustain the rally. The AI, semiconductor and cloud sectors, have already reached high valuations, and I would bet on a broad market correction.",232,141,2025-09-07 17:47:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nazqw0/the_weak_payroll_report_of_only_22000_jobs_is_bad/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325069

1natkef,stocks,"Everyone seems to be bearish, what percent do you think the s&p will drop?","The housing market now has 500,000 more sellers than buyers. The largest gap ever recorded. 

Valuations higher than the dot com bubble. 

Job creation numbers keep being adjusted to the downside. There are more Americans out of work than there are jobs available. 

Although a rate cut is expected, it's already priced in and markets have historically gone down afterwards.

4 out of the last 5 years, September has been one of the worst months of the year for the s&p. 

We're in a spending crisis and people are afraid to buy long term bonds. The strength of the US dollar is getting pummeled and people are running to gold and other safe haven assets. 

When you think of sectors that money runs to during a downturn I think of precious metals, consumer staples, industrials and healthcare. Most of those  seem to have moderate valuations, but leaders in their sectors Wmt, Cost, Ge, Rtx, LLY, Abbv are all very high. Gld is at its all time highs too. 

5 months ago we saw a 10% drop followed by a 30% run.

1napdma,stocks,OPEN Reality Check: From Someone Who Actually Built the Products You're Betting On,"*TL;DR:* While I'm rooting for OPEN long-term, the current price will correct down significantly. If you have profits, seriously consider taking some. This is deep in casino mode now - be warned.

Former OPEN leader here. More importantly, I’ve diamond-handed OPEN stock for years. I rode $OPEN up, then all the way down to 50¢. If you've only been holding for weeks, listen up. (*Update*: If my background is a distraction, ignore - most of my points below are public information anyway)

I also spent years protecting regular people from financial predators. The pump-and-dump energy around OPEN right now feels very familiar.

Over the weekend I talked to a few folks ready to jump in without realizing this is pure casino mode -  that’s what pushed me to write this up. If you already know OPEN is pure casino now, no need to keep reading - you likely know the rest already or do not care.

# Where We Are: Phenomenal Momentum, Terrible Risk/Reward

The $OPEN chart might as well have 🚀 on it. Golden Cross, record volume, RSI overbought - every meme signal is flashing. So we got a whopping 10x move from 50¢ in June to $6+ now.

But here’s the problem: options even with the new peak today give you less than 20% odds of hitting $12 in the next few months. 

Translation: you might roll a 6 and 2x, but odds are higher you get smacked with a 40–50% downdraft. 

This rally is priced to flame out in weeks, not years. Think before you YOLO because your buddy doubled last week.

# What Insiders Are Actually Doing

Forget charts. Look at the people with the most information.

* **Carrie** (former CEO)**:** As soon as she was **free** to sell after leaving, she unloaded \~$35M at $5/share. Usually that’s all you need to know.
* **Shrisha** (interim CEO): Yes, bought 30k shares - first insider buy I remember. Props, but symbolic. He already had a [4,250,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000180116925000078/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1756411509.xml) share grant, and his cash comp just jumped by [another $500k-$1M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000114036125033195/ef20054807_8ka.htm). A 30k buy is <1% of his stake and covered by his raise. To be clear, I'm rooting for him and have been very impressed by his leadership, but that buy isn't something you should make big bets on.
* **Veterans:** Every insider free to sell I've talked to has sold everything (except one). That includes 10-year veterans who have seen it all. And more telling: no one is buying.

Sure, insiders sell for all kinds of reasons. But here’s the pattern: nobody was buying at $2 - and they sure aren’t buying at $6–7. that tells you everything.

# Why the Bull Arguments Don't Hold Water

I hear the bull cases - “I will wait for Fed cuts / new CEO / earnings.” Here’s why they don’t stack up:

* **Rates: Already Baked In** The stock trades higher now than when rates were close to zero and Opendoor was doing 5x the revenue. A predictable 25 bps cut in two weeks? Classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” (look it up) - the price might actually drop. 
* **Q3 Earnings Will Be Brutal:** Don't take my word for it. Opendoor's own [guidance](https://www.opendoor.com/articles/2025-second-quarter-financial-results) shows revenue dropping 50% from Q2's $1.57B to just $800-875M in Q3. They also forecast returning to losses: adjusted EBITDA loss of $21-28M after barely eking out a $23M profit in Q2. How do you think retail buyers will react when earnings show a 50% revenue drop?
* **New CEO Won't Be Magic:** Short of hiring Elon Musk, no new CEO can justify a 5x-10x price jump alone. The business model challenges remain the same regardless of who's in charge. Leadership takes time. This market won’t wait.

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying OPEN is worthless or to trash the company. I genuinely want the company, and the years of work by some of the most talented people I have known, to be lasting. The Q2 2025 positive EBITDA of $23M was a monumental achievement after years of losses.

But this 1000% rally has priced in years of perfect execution. You're betting everything goes right - housing recovers, margins improve, debt becomes manageable.

Even if the next two weeks are great, the next few months will likely be ugly. Q3 earnings will show that 50% revenue drop. The new CEO search will take time. Rate cuts won't magically fix the business model. And when reality hits, this thing will fall fast.

**If you have profits:** Take some off the table. Insiders sold at well below $5, you're sitting at $6-7.

**If you believe long-term:** Wait for a better entry point. This isn't your last chance.

**If you're speculating:** Set stops and don't risk money you can't lose.

I know I'll get hate from true believers (whom I respect) and from pumpers looking for exit liquidity. That's fine. Call me a pessimist or worse - that's better than watching ordinary people get wrecked.

*Update:* I edited the post to add a few points I had cut earlier for brevity, as it seems folk had interest in what I had to say.",343,128,2025-09-07 10:02:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1napdma/open_reality_check_from_someone_who_actually/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325109

1na2xhp,stocks,"Record $7.4 Trillion in cash on the sidelines, will dip buyers prevent the next crash?","There is currently a record **$7.4 trillion sitting in money market funds and cash equivalents**. Some argue this could provide a strong floor for equities since there’s so much “dry powder” ready to buy the dip. Others point out that investors often hesitate to deploy cash during sharp selloffs, waiting until markets have already recovered before stepping in.

Do you think this cash hoard will actually help stabilize the market during downturns, or is it more likely to sit on the sidelines until after the damage is done?

1n9n3w3,stocks,Nestle has fired its CEO because he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a direct subordinate,"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpm9ee9p9o

> Nestle has fired its chief executive after just one year in the job because he failed to disclose a ""romantic relationship"" with a ""direct subordinate"". The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director. The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel. Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""

> The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned. As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"". The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated. After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld. A spokesperson for Nestle said: ""We acted at all times in line with best practice corporate governance.",1549,133,2025-09-06 01:38:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n9n3w3/nestle_has_fired_its_ceo_because_he_failed_to/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325213
1n9jpac,stocks,"Kinsale Capital Group ($KNSL) - Expensive on the surface, a long term high quality growth opportunity underneath","Disclaimer: I currently own a small tracker position <1% of my portfolio. Looking to increase to a 15-20% position over the coming months to year.

Kinsale Capital ($KNSL) is a lesser known name in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space. Formed in 2009 by founder and CEO Michael Kehoe (see speech from him on YT talking on Baron conference) with others from James River, the company went public in 2016 and has since delivered a ~22X return for investors since IPO. I believe this company has much more room for growth, and the recent multiple compression occurring over the last 2 years due to no significant share price movement offers a good entry point for new long term investors.

Kinsale Capital is the only publicly traded pure play excess and surplus (E&S) insurer of P&C. Basically for those that don't follow the insurance industry, this is a ""niche"" insurance market for risk that the standard market cannot bear, underwrite or price. This market has a total adressable value of >115B. It's for policies that carry too much risk or are so unconventional that no standard insurer (i.e. Progressive, Libery Mutual, GEICO...) in the admitted market will accept it. Think risky buisnesses like a night club in a rough part of town, a weapons manufacturer, a demolitions company, or a business that has already made multiple claims in the past. Where standard insurers turn away from this risk, Kinsale steps in. The E&S market is not limited by regulations and policies as compared to the standard market, and Kinsale is allowed to thereby create its own prices to fully adjust for the risk it bears and add significant exclusions to its policies to limit risk.

Anywho, Kehoe discusses the business quite well in his speech from the Baron conference, so you can get a more detailed idea by watching the video.

Sounds great? What's the catch?

The company has historically traded at a significant premium valuation for an insurance/financial business, which I believe is why the stock has been relatively stagnant since October 2023. It has had two short thesis written on it on VIC and have heard of other shorts explaining their thesis on YouTube. Shorts have thus far not succeeded in their plays. Its 5 year average trailing PE has hovered around 38, and forward PE of 34. It has also carried a significant price to book premium of 7-8x, as compared to most insurance carriers at 1-2x.

Since October 2023 with no significant movement in share price, the multiples have compressed as the buisness continues to grow. The trailing and fwd PE now hovers around 24, and price to book has contracted to a, still frothy, 6x.

My thesis lies in my conviction that this premium is well justified. Following Buffets timeless saying, own wonderful businesses at fair prices, as compared to fair businesses at wonderful prices.

There are several factors that stand out with Kinsale which I believe justify it's high valuation. The company is growing significantly faster than most insurance carriers. Net income and underwriting income y/y continues to grow at rates from 25-45%. The ROE sits comfortably around 30%. The company also has a combined ratio, the primary metric used by insurance carriers to show profitability after accounting for claims payouts and business expenses, of astounding percentages in the mid-70s. As of the most recent quarter, 75.8% - this is practically unheard of in the insurance business. Most insurers average in the low to mid 90s (lower is better, indicating more profitability. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit while combined ratio over 100% indicates an underwriting loss).

The company operates a lean, low cost business model and only has about 700 full time employees. Kehoe has stated that they are very disciplined in their underwriting and carry conservative loss reserves. The E&S space continues to also grow annually in the low teens, roughly double that of the standard P&C space in the mid single digits. Kehoe further describes a business quality that other insurers don't have is a contemporary and centralized software to process claims quickly, where other insurers who rely on M&A must compile data across many legacy platforms that decrease efficiency and time to process claims. Kehoe also has a large shareholder incentive as the majority of his wealth is tied to Kinsale, as Chris Mayer says, skin in the game - Kehoe owns about 3.8% of the company. Finally, the company appears to have significant room for growth, as they only hold about 1.4% of the TAM of E&S policies based on their financial presentation.

While I don't think Kinsale is a screaming buy, I believe this is a good entry point for a long term position that will continue to show positive and upward momentum in the next 5-10 years.

Risks:

- Continues to carry a premium valuation despite recent years multiple compression, still holds P/B of 6x, well above industry peers

- Recent decline in growth of their largest line, commercial property, though all other lines continue to grow at ~15%

- Operates in a risky and litigious insurance space, battles with many litigations over claims

- Climate change and increase in CATs, most recently Palisades",5,14,2025-09-05 22:57:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n9jpac/kinsale_capital_group_knsl_expensive_on_the/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325220

1n9dojz,stocks,Elon Musk New Pay Package is the Inverse of what is institutional knowledge,"They just released his new 1 trillon dollar pay package that in order to hit would require certain targets. This is the only time that I've seen so many inverse things happen like this.

* Giving a founder additional shares to do his job just to motivate him when the majority of his wealth is based on Tesla in the first place, Refreshers are normal and option plans are normal, but needing 1T worth of them is not.
* They think that old Elon who used to captivate an audience through being progressive and promoting the future... will somehow return (not only has he lost steam for promising lofty ideas but people are finally tired of broken promises by him, every year its another almost there target for self driving. Also where is the new roadster?)
* Everyone is tired of Elon standing on stage trying to compute how to speak  as he jumps around and does salutes ""as a joke""  vs someone who sits back and builds out the company to its full potential
* The company still caters to a a high end, well educated consumer for their products. As soon as he lost the base for it he did all the damage control he could. He literally tried to have Trump sell his cars on the Whitehouse green, that's how desperate its got for him crying on twitch (a gaming platform) about people hating him.
* The board of directors is  stacked in his favor but also is so fearful of him that they won't standup to him. They at least have enough of a spine to make sure he hits targets to get his package. Although he will never meet those goals so I guess if you are an Elon Supporter this is great news (your lord is staying around) if you are inbetween you know what you are getting and if you hate him, well he has a giant carrot Infront of him to do something.

I think that the pay package is so strange as somehow he will recover the mess he created. If I joined a company (as Elon joined Tesla, he didn't create it) then got it to the position where he risked everything to make it the brand/success it is, then tanked it by his political/ketamine rants, then was offered 1T to act normal and bring it all back.... I'd be the luckiest person on earth. This story is bonkers.

**I'd rather see they pay someone a 1 trillion dollar pay package to wipe Elon's image out of the Tesla picture or** associated with Elon. A rebrand to being progressive, for human rights, and a environmental company .

This is the strangest pay package I've ever seen. The bottom line is, if they hired any reputable CEO that can re-establish the brand of being a modern, progressive company, they would be back on track, not trying to force this monstrosity back into its cage with money.

Tesla in Europe, China, and even North America sales are steadily declining, tax credit offsets are ending, the company needs a new face, and Elon is the worst way to promote what was once the progressive movement.

EDIT:  
To everyone saying that if they don't offer this up he'll leave and either start another competitor or destroy the brand. The issue is the brand is destroyed already by someone who tweets about illegal aliens and governement conspiracies all day and night. How has his ventures gone since he became the DOGE psychopath? XAi is a dumster fire of VC money, Boring Company has.... built a tunnel under vegas convention center that has human drivers for robo taxi's, sales have steadily declined, solar and battery have been taken over by other companies, uhhh what am I missing? Oh SpaceX.... if it wasn't for Gwynne Shotwell it would be a dumpster fire.

AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere. Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) do most of the storing of world's data currently. SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/)

Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?

There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?

If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

Or will AI become smart enough (learn using existing data) to require not much additional storage and thus there won't be much demand growth due to AI for storage?

1n98aaa,stocks,Google Fined Almost €3 Billion by EU for Abusing Adtech Power,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-05/google-fined-almost-3-billion-by-eu-for-abusing-adtech-power?srnd=homepage-americas&embedded-checkout=true


Alphabet Inc.’s Google was fined almost €3 billion ($3.5 billion) by the European Union and ordered to stop favoring its own advertising technology services, in a move that risks further inflaming tensions with US President Donald Trump.
The European Commission said Friday that Google had abused its dominance by giving its own ad exchanges a competitive advantage over rivals and that it must bring the practices to an end.

“When markets fail, public institutions must act to prevent dominant players from abusing their power,” EU antitrust commissioner Teresa Ribera said in a statement. “True freedom means a level playing field, where everyone competes on equal terms and citizens have a genuine right to choose.”

The company immediately vowed to appeal. Lee-Anne Mulholland, vice president for regulatory affairs at Google, said the move “imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money.”

The EU punishment comes at a tense moment for EU–US trade relations, with Trump repeatedly deriding the bloc’s efforts to rein in Silicon Valley giants. Although Google faces antitrust scrutiny worldwide, it won some relief this week when a US judge ruled that its search business would not need to be broken up to address the harms alleged by the Department of Justice.

Google’s adtech operations, however, also remain under threat in the US. The DOJ is expected to file proposed remedies later on Friday, ahead of a Sept. 22 hearing on those proposals. Previously, the department had floated forcing Google to divest its Ad Manager platform to tackle the alleged anticompetitive risks.

The EU warned Google in 2023 that it had abused its dominance in advertising technology to harm online publishers. At the time, the Brussels-based commission said Google had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the company’s central role in the ad tech supply chain.
Ribera’s predecessor Margrethe Vestager warned then that only a “mandatory divestment” of part of its business would solve the issues. The Dane had spent a decade in Brussels, where she hit Google with fines of more than €8 billion across three different cases, although one penalty was annulled and another cut by EU judges.",711,216,2025-09-05 15:26:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n98aaa/google_fined_almost_3_billion_by_eu_for_abusing/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325306
1n96qiw,stocks,$LULU - has it bottomed?,"Yes, cheeky title.

You may remember me from such classics as “$LULU - the bar is low” where I mentioned that I had a $1 million investment in Lulu stock at $205.

I went through the numbers and listened in on the call, and while I feel there is some turbulence ahead, I feel that it’s not all doom and gloom.

1) Tariffs have hurt, but the de minimis exemption removal was particularly painful. Increasing prices in a softening macro isn’t the way to do it, but price increases will come as rate cuts boost the economy. There is also a wild card out here: the Supreme Court may rule the tariffs illegal and order all tariffs collected to be refunded. Lutnick’s own ex-firm, which is being run by his sons, is reportedly betting on this outcome.

2) Management has had their “come to Jesus” moment. Calvin has done well and presided over massive growth, but I think they got a little too cocky. No doubt he is feeling the pressure over the 67% stock slump, and they will shake things up now and go back to what made them great to begin with. More product innovation, more technical apparel, and more frequent refreshes. They can’t just introduce a slightly different color for a model of leggings and call it a day. 

3) An activist could get involved, which could likely be Chip Wilson, the founder and a major shareholder. Chip built this company from scratch and has an uncanny sense of what the consumer wants. The last time Lulu slipped up (2018) Chip tried to buy it out. He didn’t succeed, but the changes he demanded resulted in a 10x of the stock.

4) The stock has never been this cheap; it’s at a low teens PE. Yes, the E may fall a bit more, but Lulu has $1.2 billion in cash and they’ve been actively buying back shares. If they reduce capex (they should, no need to grow store count during this time) they can direct free cash to buying up cheap shares and increasing EPS metrics.

5) Their main competitor, Alo, is not public yet. They’re spending balls-to-the-wall on influencers in order to goose their revenue so they get a higher multiple for their IPO. However, Alo has much higher CAQ and lower customer retention than Lulu, so it’s not sustainable.

By the way, before anyone declares them dead, they will have $11 BILLION in sales this year and they are very profitable. 

I’m deep in the red, but I’m not selling. I think we are higher in a few months.",1,40,2025-09-05 14:26:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n96qiw/lulu_has_it_bottomed/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325319

1n92hmm,stocks,ACHR Discussion: Can eVTOLs Ever Be Profitable?,"Greetings,

Archer Aviation (ACHR) has been on my radar as one of the more ambitious names in the emerging eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) space. With the stock now trading under $10, it’s worth taking a closer look from a value perspective.

**The Bear Case: Heavy Cash Burn and Dilution**

**Massive Cash Burn:** Archer is losing ~$500M in free cash flow annually. Scaling aircraft manufacturing is extremely capital intensive & it may be years before the company can generate positive cash flow

**Dilution Risk:** Shares outstanding are up more than 50% YoY as the company raised $850M last quarter. This shareholder dilution could continue as Archer funds its manufacturing buildout.

**Execution Risk:** To cover its expenses, Archer would need to deliver 300+ Midnight aircraft annually, far above the 50 planned in the near term. Any delays in certification or ramp up could extend losses and erode investor confidence.


**The Bull Case: Strategic Backers and Market Potential**

**Strong Investors:** Boeing, United Airlines, Stellantis, and ARK Invest are all backing Archer. This validation from major aviation players gives credibility to its long-term vision.

**Cash Runway:** With $1.7B on the balance sheet, Archer has several years of runway to prove itself, even at the current burn rate.

**Commercial Opportunities:** Initial deliveries to Abu Dhabi Aviation, plans for taxi routes at the LA 2028 Olympics, and potential defense contracts with Anduril offer multiple paths to revenue.

**Urban Mobility Moat:** If eVTOL becomes mainstream, Archer could benefit from first-mover advantage in building networks in cities where time savings (10min flights vs. hour long drives) have clear value

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/time-to-buy-the-dip-on-archer-aviation-stock-below-10/ar-AA1LR8n0?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds

**My Take:**
At under $10, Archer offers exposure to a potentially transformative technology but comes with serious risks. The high burn rate and reliance on capital raises make it vulnerable, yet the backing of large industry players and its international traction provide a real (though speculative) upside case

For me, this falls into the optionality bucket it could be a multi bagger if execution goes right or a value trap if certification drags and dilution continues

**Questions for the community:**

-Do you believe Archer can realistically ramp from 50 aircraft per year to 300+ within a decade?

-How do you handicap the probability of FAA approval by 2028?

-Would you treat ACHR as a venture style bet/ does the dilution risk outweigh the upside?",59,53,2025-09-05 11:18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1n92hmm/achr_discussion_can_evtols_ever_be_profitable/,2025-09-30 15:06:24.325352

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The company topped second-quarter earnings estimates but slightly missed revenue expectations. But it said it expected tariffs to hit its full-year profits by $240 million.

Here’s how the company did for its second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* Earnings per share: $3.10 vs. $2.88 expected
* Revenue: $2.53 billion vs. $2.54 billion expected

“While we continued to see positive momentum overall in our international regions in the second quarter, we are disappointed with our U.S. business results and aspects of our product execution,” CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement.

Shares of the company sank more than 10% after the bell Thursday. The stock is down more than 45% this year.

The company reported second-quarter net income of $370.9 million, or $3.10 per share, compared to $392.92 million, or $3.15 per share, in the year-ago period.

Same-store sales in the Americas were down 4%. Overall comparable sales increased just 1% compared to Wall Street estimates of 2.2%.

It projects third-quarter revenues will be between $2.47 billion and $2.50 billion compared to Wall Street estimates of $2.57 billion. The company said it expects earnings per share in the next quarter to be between $2.18 and $2.23 per share, compared to an estimate of $2.93 per share.
