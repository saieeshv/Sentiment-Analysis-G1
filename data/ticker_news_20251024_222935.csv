AAPL,"Some marketers are proudly touting anti-AI campaigns, but those promises could put them in a tricky spot down the road",Technology,"I'm closing my eyes and letting AI take the wheel. That's the proposed future for GM, where executives are touting a new ""eyes-off"" self-driving feature launching in 2028. Nothing like a little cat nap when you're hitting 80 mph on the highway.

In today's big story, a portion of Corporate America is proud to tell you how it's avoiding AI. But executives' deep buy-in of the tech might make its arrival inevitable.

What's on deck:

Markets: Steve Cohen's Point72 shook up its top quant unit. Here's how it all went down.

Tech: The great flattening just came for Google's ad division.

Business: If you haven't secured a ""KPop Demon Hunter"" Halloween costume yet, you might be out of luck. (Please don't tell my three-year-old.)

But first, all in on not going all-in.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.

The big story

OnlyHumans

A human wrote the sentence you are currently reading. Is that a good enough reason for you to stick around?

That's the strategy behind some big-name corporate brands. While a good chunk of businesses tout their use of AI, another cohort is proudly declaring they're against it.

(Side note: If you'd actually prefer a robot wrote this newsletter, please don't share that opinion with my bosses.)

Aerie, Heineken, and DC Comics are some of the brands shouting from the rooftops (or massive billboards) about their anti-AI stance, writes BI's Lara O'Reilly and Jordan Hart.

For these companies, it's a bet that promoting human authenticity will resonate with people who are growing tired of AI infiltrating all aspects of life.

Finding that human-AI balance was a key theme at Advertising Week New York, Lara previously reported. And even those on the cutting edge of AI seem to recognize the need to tap into the human element.

Just look at this ad from OpenAI of a guy trying to do pull-ups. How very relatable and human!

Of course, there's no guarantee people are buying it.

""Would you like me to go ahead and do the workout for you?"" reads one of the top comments on YouTube.

The anti-AI companies are toeing a fine line.

While most people have some level of AI fatigue — I'm sick of getting tricked by those fake, AI-generated post-game press conferences — it also seems foolish to disregard the technology altogether.

The benefits of leveraging AI to some degree are undeniable, and dismissing that could be a grave mistake. Some might argue that a purely human approach in a world full of AI is a differentiator, like a restaurant sourcing all its ingredients from a local farm.

But while that business model might work on a small scale, the bigger you are the harder it becomes. That's especially true if your rivals are willing to dive into the AI pool headfirst.

Marketers could also be doing a bit of self-preservation. The more you proclaim the importance of marketing your company as human-first, the more job security you give yourself.

However, one study hints at the inevitability of AI adoption. The survey found 87% of executives use AI on the job, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman. That's compared to just 57% usage among managers and 27% of employees using it.

The split shows how those at the top of orgs are the biggest proponents of the tech. But that doesn't make the adoption any easier, as Sarah covered in the deep divide taking place at video-game giant Electronic Arts.

1. Behind the shocking shakeup at Steve Cohen's top quant unit. The surprising ouster of Cubist president Denis Dancanet followed months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top leader, people familiar with the matter said. Cubist is the roughly $7 billion quant division of Cohen's hedge fund Point72. Here's how it all unfolded.

2. Beyond Meat's meme-stock craze might be starting to spoil. Shares in the buzzy plant-based meat company finished down 1% on Wednesday and fell a further 20% in early trading on Thursday. Two options trading data points — and even the retail trader driving Beyond Meat's rally — suggest investors should be cautious.

3. Why gold's record-breaking rally has stalled out. After repeatedly hitting all-time highs over the course of a month, the precious metal has recently retreated. Market experts say gold's decline is likely driven by technical factors.

3 things in tech

1. Google is stripping back management layers (again). In a memo sent to staff last month, the search giant said it was eliminating a middle-management layer in its US ads business. The move is part of Google's larger efforts to speed up decisions and cut bureaucracy, and it reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech.

2. Meta's AI layoffs, in its own words. Chief AI officer Alexandr Wang said the cuts, which affect 600 Superintelligence Labs employees, will help the company make decisions more quickly. Read the full memo.

3. Amazon is taking the L in AI, but can it bounce back? Bernstein's Mark Shmulik — a top Wall Street tech analyst — said in a note that while AWS might be last in the AI race, it's not dead yet. Shmulik said AWS is showing early signs of progress, and its partnership with Anthropic is promising.

3 things in business

1. Tesla's record quarterly revenue wasn't enough for Wall Street. The EV giant's profit came in below analyst expectations, causing the stock to decline in after-hours trading. Elon Musk also railed against the major proxy firms opposing his proposed pay package, calling them ""corporate terrorists.""

2. Good luck finding a ""KPop Demon Hunters"" Halloween costume. Looks like Netflix really underestimated demand: The officially licensed costumes by Spirit Halloween are sold out online and in most stores. However, unlicensed dupes abound on sites like Etsy and Amazon.

3. It may be the toughest season ever for 'Shark Tank' contestants. Why? Because Tariffs are screwing up the show's usual playbook, BI's Katherine Li writes. For businesses that rely on global supply chains, the cost of production and projected profits may have collapsed between their on-camera pitch and the time their episode airs.

AAPL,Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Skids After Earnings Miss,Technology,"Tesla (TSLA) shares fell Thursday morning after the company's quarterly profit came in short of analysts' estimates, even as it returned to revenue growth following two quarters of declines.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share in the period, missing the average Wall Street estimate of 54 cents a share. Lower EV prices and higher operating costs tied to restructuring and AI investments dented the bottom line. CEO Elon Musk told analysts that Tesla is at a ""critical inflection point"" as it focuses on its next phase of growth, which will center on “real-world” applications of AI, including self-driving cars and smart robots.

Tesla shares were down 5% at around $418 in the opening minutes of Thursday's session. The stock, which was the top performer among Magnificent Seven stocks in the third quarter, was up 9% for the year through Wednesday's close.

Below, we break down the technicals on Tesla’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for.

Pennant Pattern Breakdown

After hitting their 2025 high earlier this month, Tesla shares have consolidated within a pennant, a chart pattern signaling a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend.

However, the price looks set to break down below the pattern in Thursday’s trading session following the weaker-than-expected earnings, suggesting waning bullish momentum and the potential for a near-term pullback.

It’s also worth noting that volume has declined during the pennant pattern, indicating a lack of conviction among buyers and sellers ahead of the company’s quarterly results.

Let’s identify three key support levels to watch on Tesla’s chart if the shares lose ground and also point out a zone of resistance worth monitoring during potential upswings in the stock.

Key Support Levels to Watch

The first level to watch sits around $360. This area, roughly midway between the 50- and 200-day moving averages, would likely attract buyers’ attention near a trendline that links a series of peaks on the chart between November and August.

Selling below this level could see the shares retreat toward $292. The price may find support in this location near the March countertrend high and a cluster of trading activity spanning from April to July.

A more-significant retracement may spark a decline to the $267 level. Investors could see this as a high probability buying area near three prominent peaks that formed on the chart in July, September, and October last year.

Zone of Resistance Worth Monitoring

During upswings in Tesla shares, investors should keep a close eye on a zone of resistance between $465 and $489. Those who have purchased at lower prices may seek exit points in this region near the top of the pennant pattern and the stock’s record high.

AAPL,US stocks open flat as poor earnings dampen investor mood,Technology,"Synopsis

Wall Street opened flat on Thursday as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM dampened investor mood, while brewing trade tensions between the U.S. and China threatened to deepen the market's unease.

Wall Street was largely muted on Thursday, as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM cast a shadow over risk appetite, while investors kept a close eye on simmering U.S.-China trade tensions.

Tesla's third-quarter profit missed expectations, dragging its shares down 5.3%. A revenue beat offered little relief, as Wall Street grappled with tempered optimism through the week.

The electric-vehicle maker kicked off earnings for the ""Magnificent Seven"" — a cohort that forms nearly 35% of S&P 500's weight, and could dictate the market's next move.

IBM dropped 5.4% after the company recorded a slowdown in growth in its key cloud software segment, eclipsing a third-quarter beat.

Amid a whirlwind of earnings reports, profit-taking and escalating trade tensions, the equity rally is showing signs of fatigue.

Live Events

While most companies have outpaced analyst estimates, cautious outlooks have cast a shadow as investors look for justification behind sky-high equity valuations.

""The numbers are not high profile enough and not rampant enough to really drive a market through these big milestones,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.

""The caution does feed in and big earnings are to come through next week and that might just be the wait and see approach.""

At 09:38 a.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 41.34 points, or 0.10%, to 46,631.75, the S&P 500 gained 11.93 points, or 0.18%, to 6,711.33 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 23.30 points, or 0.09%, to 22,760.43.

Quantum computing firms were a bright spot after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was in talks with several of them to take equity stakes in exchange for federal funding.

IonQ and D-Wave Quantum gained 5.7% and 15.6%, respectively, while Rigetti Computing added 8%.

Energy stocks added 1.2% following a jump in crude prices on fresh U.S. sanctions against Russia. Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Halliburton rose between 1% and 2.1%.

Health insurer Molina Healthcare plunged 20.9% after slashing its annual profit forecast. Peers Centene and UnitedHealth fell 6.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

S&P Industrials index rose 0.8% after a slew of earnings. Honeywell raised its annual profit forecast on strong aerospace demand, sending its shares up 5%.

American Airlines shares gained 3.6% after the carrier raised its profit forecast for the year, while Southwest Airlines slipped 3.7% despite a surprise quarterly profit.

T-Mobile dipped 2.3% despite adding more-than-expected wireless subscribers during the third quarter.

DATA DROUGHT DRAGS ON

With the U.S. government shutdown entering its twenty-third day, key economic releases, including Thursday's usual reading of weekly jobless claims data, remain frozen, leaving investors without crucial signals.

That puts Friday's core CPI print, expected to hold steady at 3.1%, in sharp focus as the Federal Reserve's only clear inflation guide ahead of next week's policy meeting.

Markets have already priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut, with traders betting the Fed will ease again in December.

Meanwhile, a Reuters report said the Trump administration was weighing sweeping curbs on high-tech exports to China in retaliation for Beijing's latest restrictions on rare-earth shipments. The report injected fresh uncertainty into the markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.66-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 32 new lows.

AAPL,"What’s up with… Nokia, Orange, mobile security",Technology,"In today’s industry news roundup: Nokia’s third-quarter financials surprise analysts, with booming demand for AI, cloud and 5G putting the company back on track following its profit warning in July; Orange CEO doubles down on consolidation hopes as she reports overall third-quarter revenue and EBITDal growth and claims 300 million customers worldwide; Verizon’s recent Mobile Security Index finds mobile attacks are on the rise, with the threat made worse by the growing use of AI by employees in the workplace; and much more!

Nokia remains on track to achieve its full-year outlook after reporting third-quarter results that certainly seem to have come as a pleasant surprise to analysts, with AI and cloud business providing a welcome boost.As noted by Reuters, the comparable operating profit in the quarter to the end of September reached €435m, while analysts polled by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) expected this metric to reach €342m. The Finland-based vendor appears to be back on a more even keel following a difficult first six months of the year. Indeed, the vendor hadissued a profit warning in July, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. Its outlook now remains unchanged for 2025 as a whole, although it has revised upwards the operating profit outlook by €0.1bn, to between €1.7bn and €2.2bn. This is owing to a change in venture fund reporting after Nokia decided to scale down its passive venture fund investments. In the third quarter, net sales rose 9% to €4.83bn on a comparable basis, said to be aided by strong growth in optical networks and cloud services. In a statement, Nokia president and CEO Justin Hotard said network infrastructure “delivered 11% net sales growth. Optical networks grew 19%, coming largely from AI and cloud customers”. Nokia noted that AI and cloud customers accounted for 6% of net sales at group level, and 14% of network infrastructure sales. According to the Reuters report, Hotard told journalists that AI and datacentre demand “continues to be robust. In fact, it continues to accelerate from our perspective”. Net sales from cloud and network services increased by 13% as “operator investments in 5G core remain strong”, said Hotard. “Our cloud-native 5G core offering continues to gain traction and we are gaining market share”, he added. Hotard highlighted, in particular,the recent deal with VodafoneThree that marked Nokia’s re-entry as a RAN supplier in the UK market for both Vodafone and Three’s combined network operations following their recent merger. For more details about Nokia’s results, seethis press release.

This week has also seen a smattering ofthird-quarter results from telcos, including Orange, which released its figures on Thursday. During the earnings call, Orange Group CEO Christel Heydemann wasted no time in addressing the France-based operator’s consolidation ambitions following its recent€17bn joint takeover offer for certain activities of Alice France, including SFR. The non-binding offer by Bouygues Telecom, Iliad (Free) and Orange was swiftly rejected by Altice, but the trio has indicated that it intends to continue negotiations to see if an agreement can be reached. According to Heydemann, “this deal would allow us to strengthen investments in France while maintaining a competitive ecosystem for the benefit of consumers”. She also stressed there is “no certainty that we will reach an agreement, and we are willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Altice group”. Turning to Orange’s financial performance, Heydemann painted a broadly positive picture for the third quarter, noting that both revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation after lease (EBITDAaL) expenses increased in the three months to 30 September 2025. In fact, EBITDAaL rose by a reasonably healthy 3.7% on a comparable basis to €3.44bn, prompting Orange to increase its annual guidance to at least 3.5%. Revenue rose by a somewhat lower rate of 0.8% to €9.99bn. Heydemann also pointed out that Orange has now passed the “symbolic threshold of 300 million customers worldwide”. In terms of group segments, Africa and the Middle East remained a growth driver, as has now been the case for several quarters. This region saw revenue rise by 12.2% owing to a 13.1% increase in retail revenues, marking 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Orange’s domestic market, France, saw revenue fall by 3.7% on a comparable basis to €4.34bn, blamed in part on the “anticipated decline” in wholesale. At the same time, Orange said mobile net additions in France have reached their highest level since 2022. Excluding France, the Europe segment saw a return to revenue growth with an increase of 4.7%, largely owing to retail services growth. Orange Business, however, remains a work in progress, reporting a 4.3% decline in revenue. The operator described the IT services market as “challenging”, whereas Orange Cyberdefense continued to shine, with a 6.3% revenue increase in the first nine months of the year. For more details about Orange’s results, see this press release.

The various flavours of AI may be good for business, as highlighted by Nokia above, but it also brings a growing level of risk for mobile devices, according to a new report from Verizon Business. TheVerizon 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) reveals that mobile devices are “under attack, now more than ever, with 85% of organisations reporting increasing mobile attacks”. Although 75% of organisations are said to have upped their mobile security spending over the past year, the increase in the number of employees using generative AI services for work purposes “is quickly expanding the attack surface”, the report warns. It notes that 34% of organisations “fear that more sophisticated and large-scale AI-powered attacks will significantly increase their risk, and 38% believe ransomware will become even more dangerous when powered by AI”. Chris Novak, VP of global cybersecurity solutions at Verizon Business, declared that this year’s Mobile Security Index “is a clear wake-up call: Mobile security is no longer a perimeter defence but a battle fought in the palm of every employee’s hand. We talk about the perfect storm: With the rise of AI, we’re witnessing a Category 5 hurricane in mobile security, where AI is the wind – and human error is the open window”. For more details about the report’s findings, seethis press release. The report can also be found using this link.

Alternative pan-European long-distance network operatorEXA Infrastructure is maintaining its recent busy streak. On Thursday, it announced it has signed an agreement to purchase all long-haul duct assets belonging to Conexio doo Beograd, a provider of dark fibre and colocation services across Serbia. No financial details of the transaction were provided, however. The operator noted that the transaction further strengthens its “strategic footprint in the Balkans”, and builds on its previous acquisitions of Unitel in Croatia and GCN in Bulgaria. Under the agreement, EXA Infrastructure will buy two high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ducts spanning 860km, existing cables, and 15 points of presence (PoP) locations. The transaction also includes the transfer of existing customer contracts. EXA’s latest move comes hot on the heels of a “major” but unspecified investment in the diversity and capacity of its network between Marseille and Paris. The company also recentlyissued a press release to announce it had “refinanced its existing facilities and raised new financing… to support continued growth ambitions and network expansion plans”. It noted that the combined value of the refinanced debt and new investment is €1.3bn, but didn’t provide many details.",TelecomTV,2025-10-23T14:18:40Z,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/5g/what-s-up-with-nokia-orange-mobile-security-54148/,0.6,2025-10-24 22:25:37.940244,0.9999999999999999,
AAPL,European markets rise after major earnings reports; Gucci-owner Kering surges 9%,Technology,"Brendan McDermid | Reuters

LONDON — European stocks ended Thursday in positive territory as investors looked to earnings reports for clues on business activity and confidence in the region.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the session up 0.4%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index added 0.7%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.2%, and Italy's FTSE MIB also saw gains of 0.4%. Germany's DAX also edged higher, ending up 0.3%.

It was a busy day for earnings in Europe with Kering , Roche Holding , Unilever , Vinci , Thales , LSEG , Dassault Systemes , Antofagasta , Swedbank, Nokia and Lloyds Banking Group among the big names reporting third-quarter figures.

Enterprise software firm SAP released earnings late on Wednesday, which missed analyst expectations. The German company reported a 7% increase in revenue for the third quarter of 9.08 billion euros ($10.53 billion), below expectations of 9.15 billion euros ($7.96 billion), according to consensus figures compiled by LSEG.

However, it saw gains of 22% in its cloud revenue, with CEO Christian Klein putting it down to increasing AI and data cloud market share.

""For Q4 we are executing against a strong pipeline - which gives us confidence in our accelerating total revenue growth ambition for 2026,"" he said in a statement. SAP's shares ended the session up 2.2%.

Gucci-owner Kering also reported after the bell on Wednesday. The group's revenue totaled 3.4 billion euros in the quarter, down 5% on a comparable basis but it beat expectations of 3.31 billion euros, per a consensus compiled by FactSet. Gucci sales — which typically make up close to half of Kering's total revenues — came in just shy of forecasts at 1.3 billion euros, down 14% on a comparable basis on the year before. Its shares closed 8.7% higher.

In financial services, Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday reported pre-tax profit of almost £1.2 billion, slightly higher than consensus estimates of about £1 billion, but down from the £1.8 billion of the same period last year. It comes after the British lender announced earlier this month an additional £800 million charge relating to customer compensation arising from the U.K. car finance misselling scandal. Its shares were up 1.2% at the closing bell.

Shares in Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) lost 0.1% as its net interest income reached 10.4 billion Swedish krona during the third quarter, beating the 10.2 Swedish krona predicted by analysts. The bank's quarterly-earnings report showed net profits of 7.68 billion Swedish krona for the three-month period, missing the 7.86 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts, according to LSEG estimates.

Swedbank reported pre-tax profits of 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above the 9.4 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts. Shares in the Stockholm-listed lender — which has a strong presence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — fell 0.2% on the day. The bank saw net interest income reach 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above analyst estimates of 10.7 billion Swedish krona.

Attention turns to energy

Oil prices were in focus Thursday after they jumped around 3% in the previous session when the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The commodity was up by more than 5% in afternoon trade.

The administration cited Moscow's ""lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.""

European Union member states also approved new sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, to be formally adopted today, including a ban on liquefied natural gas imports further as the bloc ramps up efforts to decouple its energy supply from Russian oil and gas.

""We really want to deprive Russia of the means to fund this war to end this war,"" Kaja Kallas, European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and vice president of the European Commission, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

The continent has made progress on this, Kallas noted, but ""not all the member states are there,"" she said. ""So the criticism that we have heard, also from the United States, regarding some of our member states still buying oil and gas, it's very relevant,"" she added.

Kallas spoke ahead of an EU leaders' summit on Thursday, where further measures will be discussed. Brussels will also discuss using frozen Russian assets as a reparations loan to support Ukraine.

Broader Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell, tracking Wall Street's declines on Wednesday on concerns about U.S.-China trade relations. Trade fears resurfaced after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering curbs on exports to China that are made with U.S. software, citing a U.S. official and three people briefed by U.S. authorities.

U.S. stock markets were in positive territory as investors digested quarterly earnings releases that came out after the previous market close, including from Tesla, IBM, Moderna and Lam Research.

AAPL,Should You Hold Booking Holdings (BKNG)?,Technology,"Wedgewood Partners, an investment management company, released its third-quarter 2025 investor letter. The letter is available for download here. AI stocks remain the favorite topic of Wall Street in the third quarter. In the third quarter, Wedgewood Composite’s net return was 5.9% compared to the Standard & Poor’s 8.1%, the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 10.5%, and the Russell 1000 Value Index’s 5.3% return for the same period. In addition, you can check the fund’s best 5 holdings to know its best picks in 2025.

In its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners highlighted stocks such as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). Headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides online travel and restaurant booking services. The one-month return of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was -5.34%, and its shares gained 21.27% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 22, 2025, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock closed at $5,230.59 per share, with a market capitalization of $169.523 billion.

Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:

""Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) also detracted from performance during the quarter. Revenues grew +16% and earnings per share were up +32% on strong room night growth in its ex-U.S. markets. The Company derives over +60% of its bookings from travelers who go directly to the booking.com app or website. This has freed up advertising cash low to reinvest in distribution across search engines, social media, and now agentic commerce through OpenAI's ""Operator."" Booking's focus on fragmented hotel suppliers in ex-U.S. markets is quite differentiated, so much so that it has allowed it to amass scale in areas that competitors simply have trouble reaching. The Company's obsessive focus on generating attractive returns from advertising has also been a key driver of its success, and that should continue to be beneficial to shareholders, regardless of the marketing channel consumers choose.""",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-23T13:46:29Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hold-booking-holdings-bkng-134629426.html,0.6,2025-10-24 22:26:20.244014,0.9999999999999999,

Tesla’s earnings report was largely disappointing, with profit missing estimates despite record vehicle deliveries. Operating income plunged 40% in the third quarter, reflecting ongoing strains on an electric-vehicle business that’s being buffeted by changing US policies.

Costs are rising sharply for Tesla, with tariffs taking a more than $400 million toll on last quarter’s results. Operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the period.

Tesla shares dropped as much as 5.7% shortly after the start of regular trading Thursday. The stock is up almost 9% for the year, trailing the 14% advance by the S&P 500 Index.

‘Unmitigated Concerns’

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the unprecedented payout to Musk, the value of which is dependent on Tesla reaching market value thresholds and operational milestones. ISS cited “unmitigated concerns” with the magnitude and design of the award, while Glass Lewis took issue with its potential to dilute other shareholders’ ownership.

Musk emphasized, as he has in the past, that sufficient voting control matters more to him than monetary compensation from Tesla.

“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” he said.

After Musk was finished, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja resumed his closing remarks, praising the “amazing job” the special board committee did in constructing the award.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-23T13:40:10Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-hijacks-tesla-earnings-call-134010146.html,0.6,2025-10-24 22:26:35.142775,0.9999999999999999,

AAPL,How To Earn $500 A Month From Ford Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings,Technology,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Oct. 23.

In the meantime, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. The carmaker currently offers an annual dividend yield of 4.83%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year).

So, how can investors capitalize on its dividend yield to earn a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $124,300 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $24,860 or around 2,000 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

Ford Price Action

Shares of Ford fell 1% to close at $12.43 on Wednesday.

Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at 36 cents per share. That’s down from 49 cents per share in the year-ago period.

The consensus estimate for Ford's quarterly revenue is $43.86 billion, compared to $43.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters. It also exceeded estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.

Oct 23 - IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock dipped about 6% in early Thursday trading after the company's third-quarter results, released late Wednesday, showed slower software growth despite beating overall estimates.

The tech giant reported adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share, surpassing analyst expectations of $2.45, while revenue climbed to $16.33 billion, above the $16.09 billion consensus.

Net income rose to $1.74 billion, reversing a loss from a year earlier. IBM also raised its full-year revenue growth target to more than 5% and lifted free cash flow guidance to $14 billion.

Still, investors appeared concerned about the pace of software expansion. Software sales grew 10% year over year to $7.2 billion, matching forecasts but falling short of more bullish hopes. The Red Hat unit, a key driver of IBM's AI and hybrid-cloud strategy, showed signs of slowing momentum, which analysts said could weigh on sentiment.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said Red Hat's deceleration may unsettle investors, while Jefferies' Brent Thill noted that IBM's software recovery now depends heavily on reigniting Red Hat growth.

AAPL,Elon Musk Begged For His $1 Trillion Pay Package During Tesla's Q3 Earnings Call,Technology,"With a net worth of over $487 billion, Elon Musk is already the richest guy in the world, but that immense wealth didn't stop him from panhandling during Tesla's third-quarter earnings meeting for the approval of his proposed $1 trillion pay package. He also took the time to blast the shareholders and advisory firms that have come out against the proposal.

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the massive payout to Musk. The value of the package is dependent on the automaker reaching a litany of market value goals and operational thresholds — most of which aren't really achievable. From Bloomberg:

""There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not not so much that I can't be fired if I go insane,"" Musk said, interrupting his chief financial officer as the more than hour-long call wrapped up.

It was classic Musk: a fiery end to what had otherwise been a ho-hum earnings call largely devoted to Tesla's artificial intelligence, humanoid robot and self-driving initiatives. Shareholders will vote on the pay package at Tesla's Nov. 6 annual meeting in Austin.

[...]

Musk emphasized, as he has in the past, that sufficient voting control matters more to him than monetary compensation from Tesla.

""I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,"" he said.

After Musk's little rant concluded, CFO Vaibhav Taneja resumed his closing remarks by praising the ""amazing job"" the special board committee did in constructing the pay package. He made it clear that nothing would get approved until shareholders ""made substantial returns,"" but he did kowtow to Musk by urging said shareholders two more times to vote in favor of the plan.

As we've previously reported, if the package is approved, Musk could still be in line for billions even if his misses nearly all of the goals laid out for him. It's a pretty sweet deal. I'd also be on my hands and knees begging for it.

Tesla had a very weird third quarter. Its net income fell 37% in the three months leading up to September 30 to $1.39 billion. However, revenue rose sharply as buyers in the U.S. flocked to dealers, looking to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit that Musk's old friend, President Donald Trump, personally killed.

The Austin, Texas-based automaker delivered a record 497,099 vehicles in Q3, raising Tesla's revenue 12% to $28.1 billion. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2 billion, and energy revenue rose 44% to $3.42 billion. Services and other revenues also rose $25% to $3.48 billion, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Tesla. From Automotive News:

Tesla said its total gross margin fell to 18 percent from 19.8 percent in the same quarter last year.

[...]

""While we face near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy, we are focused on long-term growth and value creation,"" Tesla said in its third-quarter earnings report.

Analysts had expected Tesla to report revenue of $26.2 billion in the July-September quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG cited by Reuters.

Musk didn't just use the forum to beg for money. He also talked about the lofty (and fairly unattainable) autonomy goals he has set for the company.

CEO Elon Musk on the Oct. 22 earnings call said that vehicle production will expand once Tesla can offer customers a fully autonomous option that no longer requires the driver to pay attention to the road. That will happen shortly with its still-incomplete Full Self-Driving software, he said.

""Really what it comes down to is: can you text while in the car? And if you tell someone yes, that the car is now so good you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you're in the car, anyone who can buy the car, will buy the car,"" Musk said.

[...]

Musk said on the call that demand next year will also be bolstered by the launch of its dedicated CyberCab robotaxi, which won't have human controls. The CyberCab will be used in Tesla's ride-hailing fleet and go on sale to customers, Musk has said.

[...]

""We are expecting to have no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year,"" Musk said on the call. ""And then we do expect to be operating robotaxis in I think about eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year.""

Musk said in July that he expected fully autonomous Tesla robotaxis to serve half the U.S. population by the end of this year.

Musk says the robotaxi rollout is going to be dependent on regulatory approval. Yeah, bud. I'd certainly hope so.

He also talked about the Optimus robot, but it's such a pie-in-the-sky idea, I'm not going to waste your time going over it.

Tesla's deliveries for 2025 are expected to slip to about 1.6 million vehicles — down about 200,000 from 2024.

Volvo's cost-cutting measures seemed to have worked and then some. The automaker just smashed third-quarter profit forecasts despite tariff concerns and tough competition. Its new management — led by CEO Hakan Samuelsson, who returned earlier this year — has spent the past six months slashing costs at the company to counteract stumbling profits. From Reuters:

The company cut 3,000 jobs, pulled guidance and slowed investments to offset pressure from U.S. tariffs, fierce competition and an EV market slowdown.

""What we're now seeing is really, wow okay, this is delivering faster than we thought and faster than we planned,"" Samuelsson said of the cost reductions.

Volvo Cars, based in Sweden but majority-owned by China's Geely Holding, said it made an operating profit before one-off costs of 5.9 billion Swedish crowns ($627 million) in July-September, soaring above analysts' consensus forecast of 1.6 billion crowns, according to Bernstein.

This was despite a 7% drop in sales, with fully electric cars still accounting for less than a quarter of the total.

All in all, Volvo's gross margin rose 24.4% from the second quarter's 17.7% Samulsson said a facelift of the XC60 (which will soon be built in the U.S.) was a big reason for that, along with savings from cooperation with Geely's supply chain as well as the cost-cutting measures they put in place.

Not everybody is having as good a day as Volvo, though. Production at Volkswagen's main plant in Germany will proceed as planned next week, but after that, who the hell knows what'll happen? The issue stems from the risk of a microchip shortage due to a standoff between China and the Netherlands, having to do with chip supplier Nexperia. From Reuters:

The company has no current plans to launch a state-backed reduced working hours scheme at its main Wolfsburg plant near its headquarters due to the risk of microchip shortages, the person also said.

The company is, however, in precautionary discussions with the German labour agency over drawing on the option later, the source added.

As we reported yesterday, other automakers around the globe have urged the two sides to come to a quick resolution on the matter. I'm sure you remember what happened the last time there was an industry-wide microchip shortage. There were thousands of cars that were either not shipped from factories or shipped without key functions. It wasn't a good situation, and I'm sure everybody would like to avoid that scenario again

AAPL,"Tesla stock drops on Q3 earnings miss, robotaxi expansion plans leave investors wanting more",Technology,"Tesla (TSLA) reported a third quarter earnings miss after the bell on Wednesday, with operating profit dropping 40% from a year ago as the company forges ahead in a post-EV tax credit environment, and revealing robotaxi progress that left investors wanting more.

After noting it launched a ""ride-hailing service in the Bay Area using Robotaxi technology,"" CEO Elon Musk gave investors a few updates on Robotaxis.

“We are expecting to have no safety drivers in large parts of Austin by the end of this year … We are being very cautious about the deployment,"" Musk said on the earnings conference call following the report. Musk added that Tesla aims to launch Robotaxi tests in eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year, including in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona.

Tesla stock was down over 5% in early trade on Thursday.

""The company is hyper-aware of media sensitivity and potential regulatory backlash if anything goes wrong, so it is proceeding with extreme caution,"" Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note following the call. ""The Tesla story, and valuation multiple, rely on seamless execution rolling out revolutionary technology.""

""Real-world A.I. remains Tesla's ace in the hole, with the potential to unlock incalculably large markets (in Elon's words, the ""infinite money glitch""),"" Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note to investors.

Tesla launched its first Robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, over the summer and expanded its service area a few weeks later; however, a safety driver still remains in each Robotaxi.

Tesla has been testing a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the cars are driven by people. The tests and comments coming from Tesla have alarmed local officials in California.

For the quarter, Tesla reported Q3 revenue of $28.01 billion, compared to $26.27 billion expected, per Bloomberg, a 12% jump from the $25.18 billion reported a year ago. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50, compared to $0.54 estimated earnings, translating to EBITDA of $4.23 billion, versus expectations of $3.78 billion. Operating profit fell 40% from a year ago to $1.624 billion.

Tesla also said that lower regulatory emissions credit revenue weighed on its profitability.

Tesla’s Q3 earnings report comes as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) are within striking distance of new highs. The broader market has shaken off President Trump’s unpredictable tariff war, though fears of an economic slowdown in the US persist. Plus, auto sector tariffs of 25% on imported cars and parts are still in place, hurting domestic automakers.

Tesla noted on the conference call that its tariff hit in Q3 rose to $400 million; the company posted a $300 million tariff hit in Q2.

""Both deliveries and free cash flow were all-time records, but admittedly, this backdrop didn't translate into as much upside as we had expected. Headwinds included tariffs, mix, restructuring, and a higher tax rate,"" Piper Sandler's Potter added.

Earlier this month, Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company. The company also deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.

However, the sales surge came before the expiry of the US federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, the last day of the quarter. Even Tesla believes the company could be in for a tough time after expiration.

One of the moves Tesla made earlier in October to address affordability was the introduction of a stripped-down “standard” version of its Model Y and Model 3 sedans. Both models feature rear-wheel drive, smaller batteries, less powerful motors, and the deletion of some creature comforts. The two cars cost $39,990 and $36,990, respectively.

Musk also made an unusual plea at the end of the earnings call, urging shareholders to approve his package claiming he wouldn't be comfortable building ""a robot army"" without over 20% voting control.

Musk’s current pay package is embroiled in a lawsuit in Delaware, where shareholders alleged they didn’t have enough information to properly vet the compensation awarded by the board, and a trial judge agreed. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently weighing the merits of Tesla’s appeal.

Musk’s newer package faces criticism as well. Independent proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS have both recommended that shareholders reject Musk’s latest proposed pay package.

AAPL,"US Stock Markets Today: S&P 500, Dow Jones Open Flat After Tesla Earnings",Technology,"S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat on Thursday after Tesla and IBM announced their third quarter earnings. Minutes into the trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 29.96 points or 0.08%, S&P 500 also rose over 0.13%, while Nasdaq was up 0.01%.

Tesla and IBM were down over 5% after announcing their earnings. Tesla’s profit plunged as rising costs undercut a record quarter of vehicle sales, exposing strains on its operations. Adjusted earnings were 50 cents a share in the period, down 31% from a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Tesla’s operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and it now estimates the impact of US tariffs was $400 million in the period.

This comes after wall street closed in the negative on Wednesday with Dow Jones down 0.7% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite seeing a decline of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively.

With employment remaining the biggest fear, “we don’t think the CPI number tomorrow will carry much weight as the Fed meeting starts next Tuesday,” Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities told Bloomberg.

In the early minutes of trading, nine of the 11 sectoral indices were trading in green. Energy and Industrial sectors led the advance, while consumer discretionary and consumer staples were the sectors in red.

Nike Inc., Amazon.com, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Boeing Co. were amongst the gainers for the day. On the other hand, McDonald's Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and Microsoft Corp. were in the red.

AAPL,Elon Musk defends $1 trillion pay package: ‘I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted’,Technology,"“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,” Musk said Wednesday on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call, referring to the proxy advisory services who are urging investors to reject the pay plan.

The proposal would award Musk up to $1 trillion in stock if he meets key performance targets, including growing the company to an $8.5 trillion market cap, more than a 500% increase from today’s valuation. Musk insisted the package isn’t about personal gain—but rather about ensuring he retains enough influence to steer Tesla’s next chapter, focused on AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. If approved, Musk’s stake could rise from 13% to nearly 29%.

“It’s called compensation, but it’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk added. “It’s just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army, not current control, but a strong influence? That’s what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don’t feel comfortable wielding that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

Musk conceded that having voting control in the “mid-20s” per cent range would help secure a “strong influence,” but gives shareholders enough control to fire him if he goes “insane.”

Musk’s net worth is about $455 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.

Musk may soon be crowned the inaugural king of the trillionaires club

Tesla’s board announced the ambitious executive pay plan for Musk in September. If approved at the company’s annual meeting on Nov. 6, Musk will be incrementally paid out over 420 million shares of the EV company—that is, only if he can achieve the company’s growth plans, which include the delivery of 20 million Tesla vehicles and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation.

At the time of the announcement, Tesla stock price was down roughly 10% for the year, and the board felt the long-term CEO performance award would “retain and incentivize Elon to focus his energies.”

“While we believe Elon is the only person capable of leading Tesla at this critical inflection point, changing the world is neither an overnight process nor the work of a single person,” Tesla’s Board wrote in a letter to shareholders. “So, we also want your help in securing the team and strategy needed to achieve goals that others will perceive as impossible but that we know are possible for Tesla.”

Since then, Tesla’s stock has rebounded, now up more than 15% year-to-date.

Alternative assets and retirement

This is where alternative assets can step in. Unlike traditional stocks and bonds, alternative assets can be a powerful hedge against inflation — which can erode the value of your money over the long term.

Gold is a traditional safe-haven asset, meaning it’s an investment many flock to during times of market uncertainty. The precious yellow metal has also been on a historic bull run, breaching $4,000 per ounce in September. (4)

Plus, with a gold IRA, you can take advantage of significant tax benefits for your retirement. Thor Metals offers a gold IRA that allows investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold. This combination can make it an attractive option for those looking to hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

To learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases. Just keep in mind that gold is typically just one part of a well-diversified portfolio.

Another inflation-resistant alternative investment you could consider is commercial real estate.

Traditionally, direct access to the $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector was limited to a select group of elite investors, but that’s changed with First National Realty Partners (FNRP). FNRP helps accredited investors diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without needing to take on the responsibilities of being a landlord.

With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to triple net leases, accredited investors can invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.

Simply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.

FNRP also has a self-directed IRA (SDIRA), which allows you to invest for your retirement through tangible, income-producing assets that can offer predictable cash flows and long-term growth. With FNRP, your rental income and investment gains can grow tax-deferred in a SDIRA – maximizing your savings and diminishing your reliance on public markets.

How much should you have saved by age 61?

With $1.5 million saved, Jim and Helen are ahead of many Americans. The median retirement savings for Americans between 55 and 64 was around $185,000, according to the Federal Reserve. (5)

However, financial planners often suggest that by the time you reach your early sixties, you should have between eight and ten times your annual income saved for retirement. For Jim and Helen, that would equate to a nest egg between $2.4 million and $3 million, meaning they’re far below target even if they’re doing well for their cohort.

There is no single “golden number” for retirement savings, because spending habits, health and lifestyle choices vary. That said, $1.5 million can provide a comfortable retirement for some, especially if at least one spouse continues to earn income and delays withdrawals from savings accounts.

The real question is whether Jim and Helen can maintain their current quality of life in retirement.

Estimating retirement income at 61

If both Jim and Helen retire this year, they could begin drawing from their retirement accounts without penalty.

Based on the commonly cited 4% withdrawal rule, a $1.5 million nest egg could give them about $60,000 annually, before taxes. That’s 80% less than the couple’s current level of annual income.

While it seems unlikely they would be able to comfortably live at a substantially lower level of income, there might be ways they can cut costs to live on a somewhat smaller nest egg. They could use Monarch Money’s all-in-one budgeting app to see where they’re over-spending and under-investing, to make the most of their money.

Monarch Money puts all your finances under one roof, from your banking statements to your investments. You can also add separate or joint accounts to your dashboard, which can be great for tracking anything from grocery runs to gas station fill-ups for couples. The app is also well reviewed. Forbes ranked Monarch Money as their best budgeting app for 2025, as did the Wall Street Journal.

And the best part? Monarch Money offers a seven-day free trial so you can see if it’s right for you. If you like what you see, you could then snag 50% off with code WISE50.

The earlier they retire, the more seriously they’ll need to take their budgeting.

For instance, if they claim Social Security at 62, the first year Americans are eligible for benefits, they would receive about 30% less per month than if they wait until full retirement age, at 67. They would earn less than half of what they could get if they delayed retirement until 70.

If Helen were to put off her retirement until 67, her Social Security benefits could significantly boost their income. If she delays claiming benefits until then, she will receive a higher payout for life. Jim could claim his benefit earlier, wait until full retirement age or even 70 to maximize his payout.

By combining withdrawals from their savings, Social Security and Helen's continued earnings for the next six years, they could maintain their current standard of living until both are retired.

But, again, this would depend primarily on Helen’s plans and whether she’s hoping to retire now, alongside her husband.

Actionable steps before retiring

Before deciding to retire, there are a few things that Jim and Helen should consider:

Creating a detailed retirement budget that includes health care, housing, travel and discretionary spending.

Working part-time or as consultants for extra income, so that Jim and/or Helen can reduce their withdrawals from savings in the early years. If Jim finds part-time work, this could give them not only a small financial bump but also a social connection.

Meeting with a financial planner to run simulations based on different retirement ages and market conditions.

One option would be to work with Advisor.com to find a financial advisor that suits their goals. All of Advisor.com’s financial experts are pre-vetted fiduciaries, meaning they have a legal obligation to act in your best interest.

After inputting your ZIP code to find a nearby advisor, you can set up a free call with no obligation to hire, so you can make sure they’re the right fit for your needs.

From here, Jim and Helen could revisit their investment allocation to balance income needs with long-term growth potential.

The bottom line

Retiring at 61 with $1.5 million and no debt is possible, especially with one spouse continuing to work for several more years.

However, if Helen and Jim retire together, they may need to change their lifestyle to adapt to their new annual income.

They should remember that the key to retirement success is understanding how long your money needs to last, and what lifestyle you want to maintain. In Jim and Helen’s case, Helen’s continued income could provide a cushion if she decides to keep working. But her decision should be grounded in careful planning, realistic spending expectations and an awareness of longevity risk — not to mention a conversation with a financial planner.

With the right strategy, Jim and Helen could transition into retirement with both financial security and peace of mind.

Blue Jays, MLSE stake drive Rogers revenue growth amid World Series run Back to video

The leap accounted for the vast majority of growth in total revenue, which increased four per cent to $5.35 billion, despite the media segment comprising the smallest of Rogers’ three main areas. Wireless and cable make up the other two.

“In media, revenue growth was up 26 per cent, driven by a strong Blue Jays regular season and the consolidation of MLSE results,” chief executive Tony Staffieri told analysts on a conference call Thursday.

Article content

Total profits in the third quarter rose by an order of magnitude to $5.75 billion, mainly due to a one-time non-cash gain linked to Rogers’ acquisition of BCE Inc.’s stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The deal made Rogers the majority owner of the country’s largest sports company, whose assets include the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors.

Meanwhile, the Blue Jays’ “very strong regular season performance” garnered higher attendance levels and growing interest from fans countrywide, particularly in September when the team clinched a return to the post-season, said chief financial officer Glenn Brandt.

Regardless of the outcome of the championship contest that kicks off Friday, Rogers will see higher media revenue this month thanks to its baseball franchise.

“The Blue Jays’ very successful MLB playoffs and World Series run will provide further added growth in the fourth quarter,” Brandt said.

“In the highly competitive wireless market, we saw some pressure on service revenue and ARPU (average revenue per user),” Staffieri said. Executives also pointed to lower immigration levels as a reason for the slight downturn.

Cable revenue climbed to $1.98 billion from $1.97 billion the year before.

On an adjusted basis, which excluded a $5-billion gain related to the MLSE deal, Rogers said it earned $740 million attributable to shareholders or $1.37 per share in the third quarter, down from $762 million or $1.42 per share a year ago.

AAPL,Apollo considers sale of Hispanic grocer Heritage Grocers Group,Technology,"US private equity company Apollo Global Management is exploring the sale of its Hispanic grocery chain, Heritage Grocers Group.

The move comes as concerns over mass deportations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted Heritage’s core Hispanic customers to exercise greater caution over their shopping habits, dampening consumer demand within Latino communities across the US, as reported by Reuters.

Apollo could secure $1.5bn from the potential sale and has engaged investment bank UBS to manage the process.

Heritage Grocers generates $150m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and records more than $2bn in annual revenue.

Apollo and UBS declined to comment on Reuters’ inquiries, while Heritage Grocers also did not respond to requests for comment.

The company operates several Hispanic-focused grocery banners, including El Rancho Supermercado, Cardenas Markets and Tony’s Fresh Market.

Apollo acquired Tony’s from its founding family and Cardenas from private equity firm KKR in 2022, merging the two.

It purchased El Rancho in 2023.

Heritage Grocers currently operates 115 stores across Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Nevada and Texas.

AAPL,"Stocks Rise, Shaking Off Early Jitters After Tesla Earnings",Technology,"Wall Street bought the dip in riskier assets on Thursday ahead of the first trickle of government data since the start of the shutdown.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 144 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 was up 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%. The major indexes approached their highest closing levels on record before paring some of their gains in the final hour of trading.

The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 3.48% to snap a three-day streak of falling yields. The 10-year yield was up to 3.99%.

The consumer price index for September is due out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report was slated to come out just over a week ago, but the shutdown has suspended most government data releases. Heading into the report, some traders appeared to trim bets on two rate cuts through the end of the year: Odds of a half-point in cuts through December dipped to 91.9% from 95.5% on Wednesday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said earlier this month it would publish the report to allow the Social Security Administration to meet a deadline related to inflation-adjusted benefit payments. It said no other releases will be rescheduled or produced until regular government services resume.

After falling sharply on Wednesday, more speculative parts of the market like quantum computing, crypto, and nuclear were on the rebound.

“What a difference a day makes,” writes Mizuho’s Daniel O’Regan. “We are seeing the exact opposite price action of the last few days with crowded longs, high beta fliers and meme stocks regaining lost momentum.”

O’Regan writes that based on client conversations, he feels like many of the moves are driven by quantitative traders, commodity trading advisors, and rebalancing, rather than active managers.

AAPL,"Once a Tesla fan, Trump is now hobbling its profits",Technology,"Synopsis

Elon Musk's initial closeness to President Trump in early 2025 has soured, with Trump's policies now negatively impacting Tesla's profits. The end of EV tax credits, increased tariffs on imported components, and dwindling regulatory credit sales have significantly eroded Tesla's profitability despite record revenues.

When Donald Trump returned to the White House in early 2025, few corporate leaders appeared closer to him than Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO had not only advised Trump but even shared public displays of camaraderie. Investors assumed that Musk’s closeness to the US President would translate into policy advantages for Tesla, the world’s most valuable electric-vehicle company.

In March 2025, Trump turned the South Lawn of the White House into a temporary Tesla showroom in a conspicuous favour to his then adviser Musk. Tesla delivered five of its vehicles to the White House and parked them on a driveway for Trump to personally inspect. As a show of support for Tesla, Trump also bought a Tesla Model S outside the White House in the presence of Musk. Months later, when Musk has distanced himself from Trump after a bitter fallout, Trump's policies are adversely affecting the profits of Tesla

Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings showed record revenues yet sharply lower profits, as the very policies of the Trump administration now weigh on the company’s performance. Instead of benefiting from political friendship, Tesla finds itself caught in a tightening web of tariff costs, shrinking incentives and evaporating regulatory credits.

The end of incentives and the demand squeeze

Live Events

For more than a decade, federal tax credits have been the engine behind America’s electric-vehicle boom. Buyers of new EVs could claim up to $7,500 in credits, keeping Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y among the country’s top-selling cars. That incentive, first passed in 2008 and extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was crucial to maintaining steady consumer demand.

Trump’s tax-cut and spending law, signed in July 2025, abruptly ended that support by setting a September 30 expiration for the credit. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, Tesla enjoyed a rush of orders as consumers raced to secure the subsidy. But that was a one-time surge. With the incentive gone, sales momentum is already softening, and analysts expect electric-vehicle registrations to drop sharply through the end of the year.

Tesla’s third-quarter results tell the story in numbers. Revenue climbed 12 percent to $28.1 billion but profits fell 37 percent to $1.4 billion. The surge in revenue reflected the final burst of subsidised sales, while the profit decline reflected the higher costs of doing business in Trump’s America.

How tariffs and trade wars weigh on Tesla

Although Tesla builds all its U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, its supply chain stretches across continents. The company depends on imported components, including battery minerals and electronic systems sourced from Asia and South America. Trump’s aggressive trade policies, reviving tariffs on auto parts and raw materials, have driven up those costs substantially.

Tesla’s chief financial officer revealed that tariffs added more than $400 million in expenses during the third quarter alone. These import levies hit at every level of Tesla’s production, from nickel and lithium shipments to specialised semiconductors. Even as Tesla accelerates its efforts to localise production, the sudden increase in input costs has eroded margins and dented profitability.

Trump’s trade war has also disrupted global logistics. Tesla’s factories in Germany and China, which supply vehicles and components to various markets, are facing bottlenecks and higher transport costs due to retaliatory tariffs and supply restrictions. The administration’s insistence on reshoring production may appeal politically, but for a company like Tesla with an international manufacturing footprint, it has translated into an expensive logistical puzzle.

Fading regulatory credits

For years, Tesla relied on the sale of environmental and fuel-efficiency credits to other automakers as a lucrative source. Those credits, essentially payments from polluting rivals, often turned unprofitable quarters into profitable ones. But under Trump, the government has relaxed enforcement of fuel-efficiency penalties, allowing legacy automakers to pollute more without paying steep fines. That means fewer companies now need to buy Tesla’s credits and that once-reliable income stream is dwindling fast.

The fall in credit revenue, combined with rising costs and the end of the consumer tax break, has transformed Tesla’s financial profile. What investors once viewed as a politically sheltered company now looks increasingly exposed to Trump's policy swings. The public fallout between Musk and Trump over the summer, after Musk distanced himself from the administration, only intensified the perception that Tesla is now on the wrong side of the White House.

Tesla's future hinges on innovation

Tesla’s experience in 2025 is a sharp reminder that political proximity can be a double-edged sword. The early belief that Musk’s relationship with Trump would bring regulatory advantages has proved misplaced. Instead, the administration’s broader agenda, whcih includes cutting EV incentives, easing fuel-efficiency rules, and waging trade wars, has struck directly at Tesla’s core business model.

Musk, once eager to align himself with the president, now faces the consequences of that gamble. The company’s record revenues mask deepening vulnerabilities such as a fading policy cushion, rising production costs and an uncertain demand outlook. Going forward, investors will expect Tesla's success to stem from company’s ability to innovate, adapt and operate profitably in a far less forgiving atmosphere.

AAPL,“You Gotta Love It When Life Comes Full Circle.” A MAJOR Celebrity Announces NEW Deal With Six Flags Theme Parks,Technology,"Some partnerships just make perfect sense. Disney X LEGO? That’s a match made in toy heaven. Benson Boone X Crumbl Cookies? We see the vision. But the latest pop culture partnership — Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs X Six Flags theme parks — is quite the surprise.

On October 21st, the JANA Partners investment firm announced it is partnering with Travis Kelce (who is currently engaged to Taylor Swift, by the way) to “enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience” at Six Flags theme parks.

Kelce released a statement on social media, reading, “To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families! Excited to partner with JANA Partners as an investor in Six Flags. So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.”

As it turns out, Kelce has been a fan of theme parks — specifically Six Flags — for a long time. In a new press release, he stated, “I am a lifelong Six Flags fan and grew up going to these parks with my family and friends,” adding, “The chance to help make Six Flags special for the next generation is one I couldn’t pass up.”

In a New Heights podcast episode, Kelce further detailed his love of theme parks. Kelce was raised in Ohio and grew up going to Cedar Point amusement park. Cedar Point’s parent company is Cedar Fair, which merged with Six Flags in 2024. Kelce’s brother, Jason, explains on the New Heights podcast that “Cedar Point is rollercoaster U.S.A.,” adding, “It is the premier roller coaster amusement park in the country.”

@traviskelce

To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families! Excited to partner with JANA Partners as an investor in Six Flags. So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.

♬ original sound – Travis Kelce

This news comes amid a flurry of headlines about Six Flags theme parks closing around the U.S.

Several Six Flags locations have announced closures, including Six Flags America in Maryland and Six Flags Great America in California (unless they extend their lease). Four other theme parks have been closed by the company in the past:

Six Flags AstroWorld was located in Houston, Texas

Six Flags AutoWorld theme park in Flint, Michigan

Six Flags New Orleans

Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom

Six Flags CEO Richard Zimmerman announced plans to step down by the end of the year following low second-quarter earnings; the company reported a $100 million loss within three months.

Why Six Flags Had To Close 7 Theme Parks

Could this new partnership boost profits for Six Flags? Kelce has not revealed how he plans to work with the company going forward. Kelce and the JANA Partners investment firm collectively own about 9% of the economic interest in the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation.

Well, we didn’t see this news coming! We’ll be curious to see how this new partnership changes things for Six Flags. In the meantime, we’re always on the lookout for the latest theme park news, so stay tuned for more.

JPM,"Some marketers are proudly touting anti-AI campaigns, but those promises could put them in a tricky spot down the road",Financial Services,"I'm closing my eyes and letting AI take the wheel. That's the proposed future for GM, where executives are touting a new ""eyes-off"" self-driving feature launching in 2028. Nothing like a little cat nap when you're hitting 80 mph on the highway.

In today's big story, a portion of Corporate America is proud to tell you how it's avoiding AI. But executives' deep buy-in of the tech might make its arrival inevitable.

What's on deck:

Markets: Steve Cohen's Point72 shook up its top quant unit. Here's how it all went down.

Tech: The great flattening just came for Google's ad division.

Business: If you haven't secured a ""KPop Demon Hunter"" Halloween costume yet, you might be out of luck. (Please don't tell my three-year-old.)

But first, all in on not going all-in.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.

The big story

OnlyHumans

A human wrote the sentence you are currently reading. Is that a good enough reason for you to stick around?

That's the strategy behind some big-name corporate brands. While a good chunk of businesses tout their use of AI, another cohort is proudly declaring they're against it.

(Side note: If you'd actually prefer a robot wrote this newsletter, please don't share that opinion with my bosses.)

Aerie, Heineken, and DC Comics are some of the brands shouting from the rooftops (or massive billboards) about their anti-AI stance, writes BI's Lara O'Reilly and Jordan Hart.

For these companies, it's a bet that promoting human authenticity will resonate with people who are growing tired of AI infiltrating all aspects of life.

Finding that human-AI balance was a key theme at Advertising Week New York, Lara previously reported. And even those on the cutting edge of AI seem to recognize the need to tap into the human element.

Just look at this ad from OpenAI of a guy trying to do pull-ups. How very relatable and human!

Of course, there's no guarantee people are buying it.

""Would you like me to go ahead and do the workout for you?"" reads one of the top comments on YouTube.

The anti-AI companies are toeing a fine line.

While most people have some level of AI fatigue — I'm sick of getting tricked by those fake, AI-generated post-game press conferences — it also seems foolish to disregard the technology altogether.

The benefits of leveraging AI to some degree are undeniable, and dismissing that could be a grave mistake. Some might argue that a purely human approach in a world full of AI is a differentiator, like a restaurant sourcing all its ingredients from a local farm.

But while that business model might work on a small scale, the bigger you are the harder it becomes. That's especially true if your rivals are willing to dive into the AI pool headfirst.

Marketers could also be doing a bit of self-preservation. The more you proclaim the importance of marketing your company as human-first, the more job security you give yourself.

However, one study hints at the inevitability of AI adoption. The survey found 87% of executives use AI on the job, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman. That's compared to just 57% usage among managers and 27% of employees using it.

The split shows how those at the top of orgs are the biggest proponents of the tech. But that doesn't make the adoption any easier, as Sarah covered in the deep divide taking place at video-game giant Electronic Arts.

3 things in markets

1. Behind the shocking shakeup at Steve Cohen's top quant unit. The surprising ouster of Cubist president Denis Dancanet followed months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top leader, people familiar with the matter said. Cubist is the roughly $7 billion quant division of Cohen's hedge fund Point72. Here's how it all unfolded.

2. Beyond Meat's meme-stock craze might be starting to spoil. Shares in the buzzy plant-based meat company finished down 1% on Wednesday and fell a further 20% in early trading on Thursday. Two options trading data points — and even the retail trader driving Beyond Meat's rally — suggest investors should be cautious.

3. Why gold's record-breaking rally has stalled out. After repeatedly hitting all-time highs over the course of a month, the precious metal has recently retreated. Market experts say gold's decline is likely driven by technical factors.

3 things in tech

1. Google is stripping back management layers (again). In a memo sent to staff last month, the search giant said it was eliminating a middle-management layer in its US ads business. The move is part of Google's larger efforts to speed up decisions and cut bureaucracy, and it reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech.

2. Meta's AI layoffs, in its own words. Chief AI officer Alexandr Wang said the cuts, which affect 600 Superintelligence Labs employees, will help the company make decisions more quickly. Read the full memo.

3. Amazon is taking the L in AI, but can it bounce back? Bernstein's Mark Shmulik — a top Wall Street tech analyst — said in a note that while AWS might be last in the AI race, it's not dead yet. Shmulik said AWS is showing early signs of progress, and its partnership with Anthropic is promising.

3 things in business

1. Tesla's record quarterly revenue wasn't enough for Wall Street. The EV giant's profit came in below analyst expectations, causing the stock to decline in after-hours trading. Elon Musk also railed against the major proxy firms opposing his proposed pay package, calling them ""corporate terrorists.""

2. Good luck finding a ""KPop Demon Hunters"" Halloween costume. Looks like Netflix really underestimated demand: The officially licensed costumes by Spirit Halloween are sold out online and in most stores. However, unlicensed dupes abound on sites like Etsy and Amazon.

3. It may be the toughest season ever for 'Shark Tank' contestants. Why? Because Tariffs are screwing up the show's usual playbook, BI's Katherine Li writes. For businesses that rely on global supply chains, the cost of production and projected profits may have collapsed between their on-camera pitch and the time their episode airs.

JPM,Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Skids After Earnings Miss,Financial Services,"Tesla (TSLA) shares fell Thursday morning after the company's quarterly profit came in short of analysts' estimates, even as it returned to revenue growth following two quarters of declines.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share in the period, missing the average Wall Street estimate of 54 cents a share. Lower EV prices and higher operating costs tied to restructuring and AI investments dented the bottom line. CEO Elon Musk told analysts that Tesla is at a ""critical inflection point"" as it focuses on its next phase of growth, which will center on “real-world” applications of AI, including self-driving cars and smart robots.

Tesla shares were down 5% at around $418 in the opening minutes of Thursday's session. The stock, which was the top performer among Magnificent Seven stocks in the third quarter, was up 9% for the year through Wednesday's close.

Below, we break down the technicals on Tesla’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for.

Pennant Pattern Breakdown

After hitting their 2025 high earlier this month, Tesla shares have consolidated within a pennant, a chart pattern signaling a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend.

However, the price looks set to break down below the pattern in Thursday’s trading session following the weaker-than-expected earnings, suggesting waning bullish momentum and the potential for a near-term pullback.

It’s also worth noting that volume has declined during the pennant pattern, indicating a lack of conviction among buyers and sellers ahead of the company’s quarterly results.

Let’s identify three key support levels to watch on Tesla’s chart if the shares lose ground and also point out a zone of resistance worth monitoring during potential upswings in the stock.

Key Support Levels to Watch

The first level to watch sits around $360. This area, roughly midway between the 50- and 200-day moving averages, would likely attract buyers’ attention near a trendline that links a series of peaks on the chart between November and August.

Selling below this level could see the shares retreat toward $292. The price may find support in this location near the March countertrend high and a cluster of trading activity spanning from April to July.

A more-significant retracement may spark a decline to the $267 level. Investors could see this as a high probability buying area near three prominent peaks that formed on the chart in July, September, and October last year.

Zone of Resistance Worth Monitoring

During upswings in Tesla shares, investors should keep a close eye on a zone of resistance between $465 and $489. Those who have purchased at lower prices may seek exit points in this region near the top of the pennant pattern and the stock’s record high.

JPM,US stocks open flat as poor earnings dampen investor mood,Financial Services,"Synopsis

Wall Street opened flat on Thursday as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM dampened investor mood, while brewing trade tensions between the U.S. and China threatened to deepen the market's unease.

Wall Street was largely muted on Thursday, as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM cast a shadow over risk appetite, while investors kept a close eye on simmering U.S.-China trade tensions.

Tesla's third-quarter profit missed expectations, dragging its shares down 5.3%. A revenue beat offered little relief, as Wall Street grappled with tempered optimism through the week.

The electric-vehicle maker kicked off earnings for the ""Magnificent Seven"" — a cohort that forms nearly 35% of S&P 500's weight, and could dictate the market's next move.

IBM dropped 5.4% after the company recorded a slowdown in growth in its key cloud software segment, eclipsing a third-quarter beat.

Amid a whirlwind of earnings reports, profit-taking and escalating trade tensions, the equity rally is showing signs of fatigue.

Live Events

While most companies have outpaced analyst estimates, cautious outlooks have cast a shadow as investors look for justification behind sky-high equity valuations.

""The numbers are not high profile enough and not rampant enough to really drive a market through these big milestones,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.

""The caution does feed in and big earnings are to come through next week and that might just be the wait and see approach.""

At 09:38 a.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 41.34 points, or 0.10%, to 46,631.75, the S&P 500 gained 11.93 points, or 0.18%, to 6,711.33 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 23.30 points, or 0.09%, to 22,760.43.

Quantum computing firms were a bright spot after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was in talks with several of them to take equity stakes in exchange for federal funding.

IonQ and D-Wave Quantum gained 5.7% and 15.6%, respectively, while Rigetti Computing added 8%.

Energy stocks added 1.2% following a jump in crude prices on fresh U.S. sanctions against Russia. Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Halliburton rose between 1% and 2.1%.

Health insurer Molina Healthcare plunged 20.9% after slashing its annual profit forecast. Peers Centene and UnitedHealth fell 6.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

S&P Industrials index rose 0.8% after a slew of earnings. Honeywell raised its annual profit forecast on strong aerospace demand, sending its shares up 5%.

American Airlines shares gained 3.6% after the carrier raised its profit forecast for the year, while Southwest Airlines slipped 3.7% despite a surprise quarterly profit.

T-Mobile dipped 2.3% despite adding more-than-expected wireless subscribers during the third quarter.

DATA DROUGHT DRAGS ON

With the U.S. government shutdown entering its twenty-third day, key economic releases, including Thursday's usual reading of weekly jobless claims data, remain frozen, leaving investors without crucial signals.

That puts Friday's core CPI print, expected to hold steady at 3.1%, in sharp focus as the Federal Reserve's only clear inflation guide ahead of next week's policy meeting.

Markets have already priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut, with traders betting the Fed will ease again in December.

Meanwhile, a Reuters report said the Trump administration was weighing sweeping curbs on high-tech exports to China in retaliation for Beijing's latest restrictions on rare-earth shipments. The report injected fresh uncertainty into the markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.66-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 32 new lows.

JPM,"What’s up with… Nokia, Orange, mobile security",Financial Services,"In today’s industry news roundup: Nokia’s third-quarter financials surprise analysts, with booming demand for AI, cloud and 5G putting the company back on track following its profit warning in July; Orange CEO doubles down on consolidation hopes as she reports overall third-quarter revenue and EBITDal growth and claims 300 million customers worldwide; Verizon’s recent Mobile Security Index finds mobile attacks are on the rise, with the threat made worse by the growing use of AI by employees in the workplace; and much more!

Nokia remains on track to achieve its full-year outlook after reporting third-quarter results that certainly seem to have come as a pleasant surprise to analysts, with AI and cloud business providing a welcome boost.As noted by Reuters, the comparable operating profit in the quarter to the end of September reached €435m, while analysts polled by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) expected this metric to reach €342m. The Finland-based vendor appears to be back on a more even keel following a difficult first six months of the year. Indeed, the vendor hadissued a profit warning in July, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. Its outlook now remains unchanged for 2025 as a whole, although it has revised upwards the operating profit outlook by €0.1bn, to between €1.7bn and €2.2bn. This is owing to a change in venture fund reporting after Nokia decided to scale down its passive venture fund investments. In the third quarter, net sales rose 9% to €4.83bn on a comparable basis, said to be aided by strong growth in optical networks and cloud services. In a statement, Nokia president and CEO Justin Hotard said network infrastructure “delivered 11% net sales growth. Optical networks grew 19%, coming largely from AI and cloud customers”. Nokia noted that AI and cloud customers accounted for 6% of net sales at group level, and 14% of network infrastructure sales. According to the Reuters report, Hotard told journalists that AI and datacentre demand “continues to be robust. In fact, it continues to accelerate from our perspective”. Net sales from cloud and network services increased by 13% as “operator investments in 5G core remain strong”, said Hotard. “Our cloud-native 5G core offering continues to gain traction and we are gaining market share”, he added. Hotard highlighted, in particular,the recent deal with VodafoneThree that marked Nokia’s re-entry as a RAN supplier in the UK market for both Vodafone and Three’s combined network operations following their recent merger. For more details about Nokia’s results, seethis press release.

This week has also seen a smattering ofthird-quarter results from telcos, including Orange, which released its figures on Thursday. During the earnings call, Orange Group CEO Christel Heydemann wasted no time in addressing the France-based operator’s consolidation ambitions following its recent€17bn joint takeover offer for certain activities of Alice France, including SFR. The non-binding offer by Bouygues Telecom, Iliad (Free) and Orange was swiftly rejected by Altice, but the trio has indicated that it intends to continue negotiations to see if an agreement can be reached. According to Heydemann, “this deal would allow us to strengthen investments in France while maintaining a competitive ecosystem for the benefit of consumers”. She also stressed there is “no certainty that we will reach an agreement, and we are willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Altice group”. Turning to Orange’s financial performance, Heydemann painted a broadly positive picture for the third quarter, noting that both revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation after lease (EBITDAaL) expenses increased in the three months to 30 September 2025. In fact, EBITDAaL rose by a reasonably healthy 3.7% on a comparable basis to €3.44bn, prompting Orange to increase its annual guidance to at least 3.5%. Revenue rose by a somewhat lower rate of 0.8% to €9.99bn. Heydemann also pointed out that Orange has now passed the “symbolic threshold of 300 million customers worldwide”. In terms of group segments, Africa and the Middle East remained a growth driver, as has now been the case for several quarters. This region saw revenue rise by 12.2% owing to a 13.1% increase in retail revenues, marking 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Orange’s domestic market, France, saw revenue fall by 3.7% on a comparable basis to €4.34bn, blamed in part on the “anticipated decline” in wholesale. At the same time, Orange said mobile net additions in France have reached their highest level since 2022. Excluding France, the Europe segment saw a return to revenue growth with an increase of 4.7%, largely owing to retail services growth. Orange Business, however, remains a work in progress, reporting a 4.3% decline in revenue. The operator described the IT services market as “challenging”, whereas Orange Cyberdefense continued to shine, with a 6.3% revenue increase in the first nine months of the year. For more details about Orange’s results, see this press release.

The various flavours of AI may be good for business, as highlighted by Nokia above, but it also brings a growing level of risk for mobile devices, according to a new report from Verizon Business. TheVerizon 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) reveals that mobile devices are “under attack, now more than ever, with 85% of organisations reporting increasing mobile attacks”. Although 75% of organisations are said to have upped their mobile security spending over the past year, the increase in the number of employees using generative AI services for work purposes “is quickly expanding the attack surface”, the report warns. It notes that 34% of organisations “fear that more sophisticated and large-scale AI-powered attacks will significantly increase their risk, and 38% believe ransomware will become even more dangerous when powered by AI”. Chris Novak, VP of global cybersecurity solutions at Verizon Business, declared that this year’s Mobile Security Index “is a clear wake-up call: Mobile security is no longer a perimeter defence but a battle fought in the palm of every employee’s hand. We talk about the perfect storm: With the rise of AI, we’re witnessing a Category 5 hurricane in mobile security, where AI is the wind – and human error is the open window”.

Alternative pan-European long-distance network operatorEXA Infrastructure is maintaining its recent busy streak. On Thursday, it announced it has signed an agreement to purchase all long-haul duct assets belonging to Conexio doo Beograd, a provider of dark fibre and colocation services across Serbia. No financial details of the transaction were provided, however. The operator noted that the transaction further strengthens its “strategic footprint in the Balkans”, and builds on its previous acquisitions of Unitel in Croatia and GCN in Bulgaria. Under the agreement, EXA Infrastructure will buy two high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ducts spanning 860km, existing cables, and 15 points of presence (PoP) locations. The transaction also includes the transfer of existing customer contracts. EXA’s latest move comes hot on the heels of a “major” but unspecified investment in the diversity and capacity of its network between Marseille and Paris. The company also recentlyissued a press release to announce it had “refinanced its existing facilities and raised new financing… to support continued growth ambitions and network expansion plans”. It noted that the combined value of the refinanced debt and new investment is €1.3bn, but didn’t provide many details.",TelecomTV,2025-10-23T14:18:40Z,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/5g/what-s-up-with-nokia-orange-mobile-security-54148/,0.6,2025-10-24 22:27:37.343994,0.9999999999999999,
JPM,European markets rise after major earnings reports; Gucci-owner Kering surges 9%,Financial Services,"Brendan McDermid | Reuters

LONDON — European stocks ended Thursday in positive territory as investors looked to earnings reports for clues on business activity and confidence in the region.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the session up 0.4%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index added 0.7%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.2%, and Italy's FTSE MIB also saw gains of 0.4%. Germany's DAX also edged higher, ending up 0.3%.

It was a busy day for earnings in Europe with Kering , Roche Holding , Unilever , Vinci , Thales , LSEG , Dassault Systemes , Antofagasta , Swedbank, Nokia and Lloyds Banking Group among the big names reporting third-quarter figures.

Enterprise software firm SAP released earnings late on Wednesday, which missed analyst expectations. The German company reported a 7% increase in revenue for the third quarter of 9.08 billion euros ($10.53 billion), below expectations of 9.15 billion euros ($7.96 billion), according to consensus figures compiled by LSEG.

However, it saw gains of 22% in its cloud revenue, with CEO Christian Klein putting it down to increasing AI and data cloud market share.

""For Q4 we are executing against a strong pipeline - which gives us confidence in our accelerating total revenue growth ambition for 2026,"" he said in a statement. SAP's shares ended the session up 2.2%.

Gucci-owner Kering also reported after the bell on Wednesday. The group's revenue totaled 3.4 billion euros in the quarter, down 5% on a comparable basis but it beat expectations of 3.31 billion euros, per a consensus compiled by FactSet. Gucci sales — which typically make up close to half of Kering's total revenues — came in just shy of forecasts at 1.3 billion euros, down 14% on a comparable basis on the year before. Its shares closed 8.7% higher.

In financial services, Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday reported pre-tax profit of almost £1.2 billion, slightly higher than consensus estimates of about £1 billion, but down from the £1.8 billion of the same period last year. It comes after the British lender announced earlier this month an additional £800 million charge relating to customer compensation arising from the U.K. car finance misselling scandal. Its shares were up 1.2% at the closing bell.

Shares in Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) lost 0.1% as its net interest income reached 10.4 billion Swedish krona during the third quarter, beating the 10.2 Swedish krona predicted by analysts. The bank's quarterly-earnings report showed net profits of 7.68 billion Swedish krona for the three-month period, missing the 7.86 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts, according to LSEG estimates.

Swedbank reported pre-tax profits of 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above the 9.4 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts. Shares in the Stockholm-listed lender — which has a strong presence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — fell 0.2% on the day. The bank saw net interest income reach 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above analyst estimates of 10.7 billion Swedish krona.

Attention turns to energy

Oil prices were in focus Thursday after they jumped around 3% in the previous session when the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The commodity was up by more than 5% in afternoon trade.

The administration cited Moscow's ""lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.""

European Union member states also approved new sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, to be formally adopted today, including a ban on liquefied natural gas imports further as the bloc ramps up efforts to decouple its energy supply from Russian oil and gas.

""We really want to deprive Russia of the means to fund this war to end this war,"" Kaja Kallas, European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and vice president of the European Commission, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

The continent has made progress on this, Kallas noted, but ""not all the member states are there,"" she said. ""So the criticism that we have heard, also from the United States, regarding some of our member states still buying oil and gas, it's very relevant,"" she added.

Kallas spoke ahead of an EU leaders' summit on Thursday, where further measures will be discussed. Brussels will also discuss using frozen Russian assets as a reparations loan to support Ukraine.

Broader Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell, tracking Wall Street's declines on Wednesday on concerns about U.S.-China trade relations. Trade fears resurfaced after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering curbs on exports to China that are made with U.S. software, citing a U.S. official and three people briefed by U.S. authorities.

U.S. stock markets were in positive territory as investors digested quarterly earnings releases that came out after the previous market close, including from Tesla, IBM, Moderna and Lam Research.

JPM,Should You Hold Booking Holdings (BKNG)?,Financial Services,"Wedgewood Partners, an investment management company, released its third-quarter 2025 investor letter. The letter is available for download here. AI stocks remain the favorite topic of Wall Street in the third quarter. In the third quarter, Wedgewood Composite’s net return was 5.9% compared to the Standard & Poor’s 8.1%, the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 10.5%, and the Russell 1000 Value Index’s 5.3% return for the same period. In addition, you can check the fund’s best 5 holdings to know its best picks in 2025.

In its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners highlighted stocks such as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). Headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides online travel and restaurant booking services. The one-month return of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was -5.34%, and its shares gained 21.27% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 22, 2025, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock closed at $5,230.59 per share, with a market capitalization of $169.523 billion.

Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:

""Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) also detracted from performance during the quarter. Revenues grew +16% and earnings per share were up +32% on strong room night growth in its ex-U.S. markets. The Company derives over +60% of its bookings from travelers who go directly to the booking.com app or website. This has freed up advertising cash low to reinvest in distribution across search engines, social media, and now agentic commerce through OpenAI's ""Operator."" Booking's focus on fragmented hotel suppliers in ex-U.S. markets is quite differentiated, so much so that it has allowed it to amass scale in areas that competitors simply have trouble reaching. The Company's obsessive focus on generating attractive returns from advertising has also been a key driver of its success, and that should continue to be beneficial to shareholders, regardless of the marketing channel consumers choose.""",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-23T13:46:29Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hold-booking-holdings-bkng-134629426.html,0.6,2025-10-24 22:27:38.463392,0.9999999999999999,
JPM,Musk Hijacks Tesla Earnings Call to Vouch for $1 Trillion Pay Plan,Financial Services,"Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, spent the end of Tesla Inc.’s earnings call pleading with investors to approve his $1 trillion pay package and blasting the shareholder advisory firms that have come out against the proposal.

“There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane,” Musk said, interrupting his chief financial officer as the more than hour-long call wrapped up.

It was classic Musk: a fiery end to what had otherwise been a ho-hum call largely devoted to Tesla’s artificial intelligence, humanoid robot and self-driving initiatives. Shareholders will vote on the pay package at Tesla’s Nov. 6 annual meeting in Austin.

Tesla’s earnings report was largely disappointing, with profit missing estimates despite record vehicle deliveries. Operating income plunged 40% in the third quarter, reflecting ongoing strains on an electric-vehicle business that’s being buffeted by changing US policies.

Costs are rising sharply for Tesla, with tariffs taking a more than $400 million toll on last quarter’s results. Operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the period.

Tesla shares dropped as much as 5.7% shortly after the start of regular trading Thursday. The stock is up almost 9% for the year, trailing the 14% advance by the S&P 500 Index.

‘Unmitigated Concerns’

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the unprecedented payout to Musk, the value of which is dependent on Tesla reaching market value thresholds and operational milestones. ISS cited “unmitigated concerns” with the magnitude and design of the award, while Glass Lewis took issue with its potential to dilute other shareholders’ ownership.

Musk emphasized, as he has in the past, that sufficient voting control matters more to him than monetary compensation from Tesla.

“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” he said.

JPM,How To Earn $500 A Month From Ford Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings,Financial Services,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Oct. 23.

In the meantime, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. The carmaker currently offers an annual dividend yield of 4.83%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year).

So, how can investors capitalize on its dividend yield to earn a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $124,300 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $24,860 or around 2,000 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

Ford Price Action

Shares of Ford fell 1% to close at $12.43 on Wednesday.

Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at 36 cents per share. That’s down from 49 cents per share in the year-ago period.

The consensus estimate for Ford's quarterly revenue is $43.86 billion, compared to $43.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters. It also exceeded estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.

Net income rose to $1.74 billion, reversing a loss from a year earlier. IBM also raised its full-year revenue growth target to more than 5% and lifted free cash flow guidance to $14 billion.

Still, investors appeared concerned about the pace of software expansion. Software sales grew 10% year over year to $7.2 billion, matching forecasts but falling short of more bullish hopes. The Red Hat unit, a key driver of IBM's AI and hybrid-cloud strategy, showed signs of slowing momentum, which analysts said could weigh on sentiment.

JPM,Elon Musk Begged For His $1 Trillion Pay Package During Tesla's Q3 Earnings Call,Financial Services,"With a net worth of over $487 billion, Elon Musk is already the richest guy in the world, but that immense wealth didn't stop him from panhandling during Tesla's third-quarter earnings meeting for the approval of his proposed $1 trillion pay package. He also took the time to blast the shareholders and advisory firms that have come out against the proposal.

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the massive payout to Musk. The value of the package is dependent on the automaker reaching a litany of market value goals and operational thresholds — most of which aren't really achievable. From Bloomberg:

""There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not not so much that I can't be fired if I go insane,"" Musk said, interrupting his chief financial officer as the more than hour-long call wrapped up.

It was classic Musk: a fiery end to what had otherwise been a ho-hum earnings call largely devoted to Tesla's artificial intelligence, humanoid robot and self-driving initiatives. Shareholders will vote on the pay package at Tesla's Nov. 6 annual meeting in Austin.

[...]

Musk emphasized, as he has in the past, that sufficient voting control matters more to him than monetary compensation from Tesla.

""I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,"" he said.

After Musk's little rant concluded, CFO Vaibhav Taneja resumed his closing remarks by praising the ""amazing job"" the special board committee did in constructing the pay package. He made it clear that nothing would get approved until shareholders ""made substantial returns,"" but he did kowtow to Musk by urging said shareholders two more times to vote in favor of the plan.

As we've previously reported, if the package is approved, Musk could still be in line for billions even if his misses nearly all of the goals laid out for him. It's a pretty sweet deal. I'd also be on my hands and knees begging for it.

Tesla had a very weird third quarter. Its net income fell 37% in the three months leading up to September 30 to $1.39 billion. However, revenue rose sharply as buyers in the U.S. flocked to dealers, looking to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit that Musk's old friend, President Donald Trump, personally killed.

The Austin, Texas-based automaker delivered a record 497,099 vehicles in Q3, raising Tesla's revenue 12% to $28.1 billion. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2 billion, and energy revenue rose 44% to $3.42 billion. Services and other revenues also rose $25% to $3.48 billion, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Tesla. From Automotive News:

Tesla said its total gross margin fell to 18 percent from 19.8 percent in the same quarter last year.

[...]

""While we face near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy, we are focused on long-term growth and value creation,"" Tesla said in its third-quarter earnings report.

Analysts had expected Tesla to report revenue of $26.2 billion in the July-September quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG cited by Reuters.

Musk didn't just use the forum to beg for money. He also talked about the lofty (and fairly unattainable) autonomy goals he has set for the company.

CEO Elon Musk on the Oct. 22 earnings call said that vehicle production will expand once Tesla can offer customers a fully autonomous option that no longer requires the driver to pay attention to the road. That will happen shortly with its still-incomplete Full Self-Driving software, he said.

""Really what it comes down to is: can you text while in the car? And if you tell someone yes, that the car is now so good you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you're in the car, anyone who can buy the car, will buy the car,"" Musk said.

[...]

Musk said on the call that demand next year will also be bolstered by the launch of its dedicated CyberCab robotaxi, which won't have human controls. The CyberCab will be used in Tesla's ride-hailing fleet and go on sale to customers, Musk has said.

[...]

""We are expecting to have no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year,"" Musk said on the call. ""And then we do expect to be operating robotaxis in I think about eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year.""

Musk said in July that he expected fully autonomous Tesla robotaxis to serve half the U.S. population by the end of this year.

Musk says the robotaxi rollout is going to be dependent on regulatory approval. Yeah, bud. I'd certainly hope so.

He also talked about the Optimus robot, but it's such a pie-in-the-sky idea, I'm not going to waste your time going over it.

Tesla's deliveries for 2025 are expected to slip to about 1.6 million vehicles — down about 200,000 from 2024.

Volvo's cost-cutting measures seemed to have worked and then some. The automaker just smashed third-quarter profit forecasts despite tariff concerns and tough competition. Its new management — led by CEO Hakan Samuelsson, who returned earlier this year — has spent the past six months slashing costs at the company to counteract stumbling profits. From Reuters:

The company cut 3,000 jobs, pulled guidance and slowed investments to offset pressure from U.S. tariffs, fierce competition and an EV market slowdown.

""What we're now seeing is really, wow okay, this is delivering faster than we thought and faster than we planned,"" Samuelsson said of the cost reductions.

Volvo Cars, based in Sweden but majority-owned by China's Geely Holding, said it made an operating profit before one-off costs of 5.9 billion Swedish crowns ($627 million) in July-September, soaring above analysts' consensus forecast of 1.6 billion crowns, according to Bernstein.

This was despite a 7% drop in sales, with fully electric cars still accounting for less than a quarter of the total.

All in all, Volvo's gross margin rose 24.4% from the second quarter's 17.7% Samulsson said a facelift of the XC60 (which will soon be built in the U.S.) was a big reason for that, along with savings from cooperation with Geely's supply chain as well as the cost-cutting measures they put in place.

Not everybody is having as good a day as Volvo, though. Production at Volkswagen's main plant in Germany will proceed as planned next week, but after that, who the hell knows what'll happen? The issue stems from the risk of a microchip shortage due to a standoff between China and the Netherlands, having to do with chip supplier Nexperia. From Reuters:

The company has no current plans to launch a state-backed reduced working hours scheme at its main Wolfsburg plant near its headquarters due to the risk of microchip shortages, the person also said.

The company is, however, in precautionary discussions with the German labour agency over drawing on the option later, the source added.

As we reported yesterday, other automakers around the globe have urged the two sides to come to a quick resolution on the matter. I'm sure you remember what happened the last time there was an industry-wide microchip shortage. There were thousands of cars that were either not shipped from factories or shipped without key functions. It wasn't a good situation, and I'm sure everybody would like to avoid that scenario again

JPM,"Tesla stock drops on Q3 earnings miss, robotaxi expansion plans leave investors wanting more",Financial Services,"Tesla (TSLA) reported a third quarter earnings miss after the bell on Wednesday, with operating profit dropping 40% from a year ago as the company forges ahead in a post-EV tax credit environment, and revealing robotaxi progress that left investors wanting more.

After noting it launched a ""ride-hailing service in the Bay Area using Robotaxi technology,"" CEO Elon Musk gave investors a few updates on Robotaxis.

“We are expecting to have no safety drivers in large parts of Austin by the end of this year … We are being very cautious about the deployment,"" Musk said on the earnings conference call following the report. Musk added that Tesla aims to launch Robotaxi tests in eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year, including in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona.

Tesla stock was down over 5% in early trade on Thursday.

""The company is hyper-aware of media sensitivity and potential regulatory backlash if anything goes wrong, so it is proceeding with extreme caution,"" Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note following the call. ""The Tesla story, and valuation multiple, rely on seamless execution rolling out revolutionary technology.""

""Real-world A.I. remains Tesla's ace in the hole, with the potential to unlock incalculably large markets (in Elon's words, the ""infinite money glitch""),"" Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note to investors.

Tesla launched its first Robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, over the summer and expanded its service area a few weeks later; however, a safety driver still remains in each Robotaxi.

Tesla has been testing a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the cars are driven by people. The tests and comments coming from Tesla have alarmed local officials in California.

For the quarter, Tesla reported Q3 revenue of $28.01 billion, compared to $26.27 billion expected, per Bloomberg, a 12% jump from the $25.18 billion reported a year ago. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50, compared to $0.54 estimated earnings, translating to EBITDA of $4.23 billion, versus expectations of $3.78 billion. Operating profit fell 40% from a year ago to $1.624 billion.

Tesla also said that lower regulatory emissions credit revenue weighed on its profitability.

Tesla’s Q3 earnings report comes as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) are within striking distance of new highs. The broader market has shaken off President Trump’s unpredictable tariff war, though fears of an economic slowdown in the US persist. Plus, auto sector tariffs of 25% on imported cars and parts are still in place, hurting domestic automakers.

Tesla noted on the conference call that its tariff hit in Q3 rose to $400 million; the company posted a $300 million tariff hit in Q2.

""Both deliveries and free cash flow were all-time records, but admittedly, this backdrop didn't translate into as much upside as we had expected. Headwinds included tariffs, mix, restructuring, and a higher tax rate,"" Piper Sandler's Potter added.

Earlier this month, Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company. The company also deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.

However, the sales surge came before the expiry of the US federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, the last day of the quarter. Even Tesla believes the company could be in for a tough time after expiration.

One of the moves Tesla made earlier in October to address affordability was the introduction of a stripped-down “standard” version of its Model Y and Model 3 sedans. Both models feature rear-wheel drive, smaller batteries, less powerful motors, and the deletion of some creature comforts. The two cars cost $39,990 and $36,990, respectively.

Musk also made an unusual plea at the end of the earnings call, urging shareholders to approve his package claiming he wouldn't be comfortable building ""a robot army"" without over 20% voting control.

Musk’s current pay package is embroiled in a lawsuit in Delaware, where shareholders alleged they didn’t have enough information to properly vet the compensation awarded by the board, and a trial judge agreed. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently weighing the merits of Tesla’s appeal.

Musk’s newer package faces criticism as well. Independent proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS have both recommended that shareholders reject Musk’s latest proposed pay package.

JPM,"US Stock Markets Today: S&P 500, Dow Jones Open Flat After Tesla Earnings",Financial Services,"S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat on Thursday after Tesla and IBM announced their third quarter earnings. Minutes into the trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 29.96 points or 0.08%, S&P 500 also rose over 0.13%, while Nasdaq was up 0.01%.

Tesla and IBM were down over 5% after announcing their earnings. Tesla’s profit plunged as rising costs undercut a record quarter of vehicle sales, exposing strains on its operations. Adjusted earnings were 50 cents a share in the period, down 31% from a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Tesla’s operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and it now estimates the impact of US tariffs was $400 million in the period.

This comes after wall street closed in the negative on Wednesday with Dow Jones down 0.7% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite seeing a decline of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively.

With employment remaining the biggest fear, “we don’t think the CPI number tomorrow will carry much weight as the Fed meeting starts next Tuesday,” Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities told Bloomberg.

In the early minutes of trading, nine of the 11 sectoral indices were trading in green. Energy and Industrial sectors led the advance, while consumer discretionary and consumer staples were the sectors in red.

Nike Inc., Amazon.com, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Boeing Co. were amongst the gainers for the day. On the other hand, McDonald's Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and Microsoft Corp. were in the red.

As the US market opened, spot gold rose 1% to $4,140.10 an ounce. Crude oil prices rose, with the West Texas trading 5.1% higher at $61.47 per barrel.

The Bloomberg Dollar Index was little changed, with the British Pound at $1.3345 and the Japanese yen fell 0.4% at 152.54 per dollar.

JPM,Rivian Announces Second Round of Layoffs in a Month as EV Industry Woes Deepen,Financial Services,"Electric truck maker Rivian is conducting another round of layoffs, cutting over 600 jobs, which amounts to four percent of its headcount, as the company tries to reduce costs amidst a pullback in the EV industry. This is the EV company’s second round of layoffs in a month.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Rivian, the electric vehicle manufacturer known for its pickup trucks and SUVs, is laying off more than 600 employees, representing around four percent of its total workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. The company had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year. This marks the second round of job cuts in a month, following a smaller layoff affecting 1.5 percent of its staff, which Rivian said was aimed at reducing costs ahead of launching a more affordable SUV in 2026.

The electric vehicle industry is facing significant challenges due to the rollback of policies that supported EV adoption. The expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers is expected to significantly impact sales. Furthermore, these policy changes have disrupted the market for compliance credits, which have been a crucial source of profitability for Rivian and other EV manufacturers. Rivian has estimated that the changes could result in approximately $100 million in revenue being delayed.

Despite a 32 percent increase in vehicle sales to 13,201 units in the third quarter, Rivian has lowered its full-year delivery guidance to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles, down from its previous forecast of up to 46,000 deliveries. The company is set to report its full quarterly earnings on November 4.

As a publicly-traded company since 2021, Rivian has been under pressure to reduce expenses while preparing for the launch of its next model, the R2 SUV. The R2 is expected to have a starting price of around $45,000, making it more affordable than the company’s current R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which start at $70,990 and $76,900, respectively. Rivian anticipates higher demand for the R2 compared to its current models.

Despite losing $1.1 billion in the second quarter, Rivian has stated that it has sufficient funds to launch the R2. However, the company recognizes the need to streamline its operations and reduce costs to navigate the challenging market conditions and ensure long-term success in the competitive electric vehicle industry.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe taunted proponents of gas-powered cars in 2023, when the Democrat plan to force EVs on Americans was in full swing:

Rivian CEO, RJ Scaringe, recently compared the purchase of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to “building a horse barn in 1910.”

Rivian exceeded market expectations by delivering 12,640 EVs in the second quarter of this year. The company is on track to meet its annual production guidance of 50,000 vehicles. “The performance and drivability of an EV makes it so much more desirable than an alternative,” Scaringe said. He added, “Buying a non-EV just feels very old,” adding that while the environmental responsibility is a factor, he also feels that regular ICE cars are boring.

JPM,Elon Musk defends $1 trillion pay package: ‘I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted’,Financial Services,"“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,” Musk said Wednesday on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call, referring to the proxy advisory services who are urging investors to reject the pay plan.

The proposal would award Musk up to $1 trillion in stock if he meets key performance targets, including growing the company to an $8.5 trillion market cap, more than a 500% increase from today’s valuation. Musk insisted the package isn’t about personal gain—but rather about ensuring he retains enough influence to steer Tesla’s next chapter, focused on AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. If approved, Musk’s stake could rise from 13% to nearly 29%.

“It’s called compensation, but it’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk added. “It’s just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army, not current control, but a strong influence? That’s what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don’t feel comfortable wielding that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

Musk conceded that having voting control in the “mid-20s” per cent range would help secure a “strong influence,” but gives shareholders enough control to fire him if he goes “insane.”

Musk’s net worth is about $455 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.

Musk may soon be crowned the inaugural king of the trillionaires club

Tesla’s board announced the ambitious executive pay plan for Musk in September. If approved at the company’s annual meeting on Nov. 6, Musk will be incrementally paid out over 420 million shares of the EV company—that is, only if he can achieve the company’s growth plans, which include the delivery of 20 million Tesla vehicles and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation.

At the time of the announcement, Tesla stock price was down roughly 10% for the year, and the board felt the long-term CEO performance award would “retain and incentivize Elon to focus his energies.”

“While we believe Elon is the only person capable of leading Tesla at this critical inflection point, changing the world is neither an overnight process nor the work of a single person,” Tesla’s Board wrote in a letter to shareholders. “So, we also want your help in securing the team and strategy needed to achieve goals that others will perceive as impossible but that we know are possible for Tesla.”

Since then, Tesla’s stock has rebounded, now up more than 15% year-to-date.

Alternative assets and retirement

This is where alternative assets can step in. Unlike traditional stocks and bonds, alternative assets can be a powerful hedge against inflation — which can erode the value of your money over the long term.

Gold is a traditional safe-haven asset, meaning it’s an investment many flock to during times of market uncertainty. The precious yellow metal has also been on a historic bull run, breaching $4,000 per ounce in September. (4)

Plus, with a gold IRA, you can take advantage of significant tax benefits for your retirement. Thor Metals offers a gold IRA that allows investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold. This combination can make it an attractive option for those looking to hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

To learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases. Just keep in mind that gold is typically just one part of a well-diversified portfolio.

Another inflation-resistant alternative investment you could consider is commercial real estate.

Traditionally, direct access to the $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector was limited to a select group of elite investors, but that’s changed with First National Realty Partners (FNRP). FNRP helps accredited investors diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without needing to take on the responsibilities of being a landlord.

With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to triple net leases, accredited investors can invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.

Simply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.

FNRP also has a self-directed IRA (SDIRA), which allows you to invest for your retirement through tangible, income-producing assets that can offer predictable cash flows and long-term growth. With FNRP, your rental income and investment gains can grow tax-deferred in a SDIRA – maximizing your savings and diminishing your reliance on public markets.

How much should you have saved by age 61?

With $1.5 million saved, Jim and Helen are ahead of many Americans. The median retirement savings for Americans between 55 and 64 was around $185,000, according to the Federal Reserve. (5)

However, financial planners often suggest that by the time you reach your early sixties, you should have between eight and ten times your annual income saved for retirement. For Jim and Helen, that would equate to a nest egg between $2.4 million and $3 million, meaning they’re far below target even if they’re doing well for their cohort.

There is no single “golden number” for retirement savings, because spending habits, health and lifestyle choices vary. That said, $1.5 million can provide a comfortable retirement for some, especially if at least one spouse continues to earn income and delays withdrawals from savings accounts.

The real question is whether Jim and Helen can maintain their current quality of life in retirement.

Estimating retirement income at 61

If both Jim and Helen retire this year, they could begin drawing from their retirement accounts without penalty.

Based on the commonly cited 4% withdrawal rule, a $1.5 million nest egg could give them about $60,000 annually, before taxes. That’s 80% less than the couple’s current level of annual income.

While it seems unlikely they would be able to comfortably live at a substantially lower level of income, there might be ways they can cut costs to live on a somewhat smaller nest egg. They could use Monarch Money’s all-in-one budgeting app to see where they’re over-spending and under-investing, to make the most of their money.

Monarch Money puts all your finances under one roof, from your banking statements to your investments. You can also add separate or joint accounts to your dashboard, which can be great for tracking anything from grocery runs to gas station fill-ups for couples. The app is also well reviewed. Forbes ranked Monarch Money as their best budgeting app for 2025, as did the Wall Street Journal.

And the best part? Monarch Money offers a seven-day free trial so you can see if it’s right for you. If you like what you see, you could then snag 50% off with code WISE50.

The earlier they retire, the more seriously they’ll need to take their budgeting.

For instance, if they claim Social Security at 62, the first year Americans are eligible for benefits, they would receive about 30% less per month than if they wait until full retirement age, at 67. They would earn less than half of what they could get if they delayed retirement until 70.

If Helen were to put off her retirement until 67, her Social Security benefits could significantly boost their income. If she delays claiming benefits until then, she will receive a higher payout for life. Jim could claim his benefit earlier, wait until full retirement age or even 70 to maximize his payout.

By combining withdrawals from their savings, Social Security and Helen's continued earnings for the next six years, they could maintain their current standard of living until both are retired.

But, again, this would depend primarily on Helen’s plans and whether she’s hoping to retire now, alongside her husband.

Actionable steps before retiring

Before deciding to retire, there are a few things that Jim and Helen should consider:

Creating a detailed retirement budget that includes health care, housing, travel and discretionary spending.

Working part-time or as consultants for extra income, so that Jim and/or Helen can reduce their withdrawals from savings in the early years. If Jim finds part-time work, this could give them not only a small financial bump but also a social connection.

From here, Jim and Helen could revisit their investment allocation to balance income needs with long-term growth potential.

The bottom line

Retiring at 61 with $1.5 million and no debt is possible, especially with one spouse continuing to work for several more years.

However, if Helen and Jim retire together, they may need to change their lifestyle to adapt to their new annual income.

They should remember that the key to retirement success is understanding how long your money needs to last, and what lifestyle you want to maintain. In Jim and Helen’s case, Helen’s continued income could provide a cushion if she decides to keep working. But her decision should be grounded in careful planning, realistic spending expectations and an awareness of longevity risk — not to mention a conversation with a financial planner.

With the right strategy, Jim and Helen could transition into retirement with both financial security and peace of mind.

Blue Jays, MLSE stake drive Rogers revenue growth amid World Series run Back to video

Article content

The leap accounted for the vast majority of growth in total revenue, which increased four per cent to $5.35 billion, despite the media segment comprising the smallest of Rogers’ three main areas. Wireless and cable make up the other two.

Article content

Article content

“In media, revenue growth was up 26 per cent, driven by a strong Blue Jays regular season and the consolidation of MLSE results,” chief executive Tony Staffieri told analysts on a conference call Thursday.

Article content

Total profits in the third quarter rose by an order of magnitude to $5.75 billion, mainly due to a one-time non-cash gain linked to Rogers’ acquisition of BCE Inc.’s stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The deal made Rogers the majority owner of the country’s largest sports company, whose assets include the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors.

Article content

Meanwhile, the Blue Jays’ “very strong regular season performance” garnered higher attendance levels and growing interest from fans countrywide, particularly in September when the team clinched a return to the post-season, said chief financial officer Glenn Brandt.

Article content

Regardless of the outcome of the championship contest that kicks off Friday, Rogers will see higher media revenue this month thanks to its baseball franchise.

Article content

“The Blue Jays’ very successful MLB playoffs and World Series run will provide further added growth in the fourth quarter,” Brandt said.

Rogers’ wireless service — its biggest income source — saw revenue dip to $2.06 billion in its latest quarter from $2.07 billion a year earlier.

Article content

“In the highly competitive wireless market, we saw some pressure on service revenue and ARPU (average revenue per user),” Staffieri said. Executives also pointed to lower immigration levels as a reason for the slight downturn.

Article content

Cable revenue climbed to $1.98 billion from $1.97 billion the year before.

Article content

On an adjusted basis, which excluded a $5-billion gain related to the MLSE deal, Rogers said it earned $740 million attributable to shareholders or $1.37 per share in the third quarter, down from $762 million or $1.42 per share a year ago.

JPM,Apollo considers sale of Hispanic grocer Heritage Grocers Group,Financial Services,"US private equity company Apollo Global Management is exploring the sale of its Hispanic grocery chain, Heritage Grocers Group.

The move comes as concerns over mass deportations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted Heritage’s core Hispanic customers to exercise greater caution over their shopping habits, dampening consumer demand within Latino communities across the US, as reported by Reuters.

Apollo could secure $1.5bn from the potential sale and has engaged investment bank UBS to manage the process.

Heritage Grocers generates $150m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and records more than $2bn in annual revenue.

Apollo and UBS declined to comment on Reuters’ inquiries, while Heritage Grocers also did not respond to requests for comment.

The company operates several Hispanic-focused grocery banners, including El Rancho Supermercado, Cardenas Markets and Tony’s Fresh Market.

Apollo acquired Tony’s from its founding family and Cardenas from private equity firm KKR in 2022, merging the two.

It purchased El Rancho in 2023.

Heritage Grocers currently operates 115 stores across Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Nevada and Texas.

Apollo has made various investments in the grocery sector, including The Fresh Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, Smart & Final and Albertsons.",Retail-insight-network.com,2025-10-23T14:03:53Z,https://www.retail-insight-network.com/news/apollo-sale-heritage-grocers-group/,0.4,2025-10-24 22:27:37.799905,0.9999999999999999,
JPM,"Stocks Rise, Shaking Off Early Jitters After Tesla Earnings",Financial Services,"Wall Street bought the dip in riskier assets on Thursday ahead of the first trickle of government data since the start of the shutdown.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 144 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 was up 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%. The major indexes approached their highest closing levels on record before paring some of their gains in the final hour of trading.

The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 3.48% to snap a three-day streak of falling yields. The 10-year yield was up to 3.99%.

The consumer price index for September is due out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report was slated to come out just over a week ago, but the shutdown has suspended most government data releases. Heading into the report, some traders appeared to trim bets on two rate cuts through the end of the year: Odds of a half-point in cuts through December dipped to 91.9% from 95.5% on Wednesday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said earlier this month it would publish the report to allow the Social Security Administration to meet a deadline related to inflation-adjusted benefit payments. It said no other releases will be rescheduled or produced until regular government services resume.

After falling sharply on Wednesday, more speculative parts of the market like quantum computing, crypto, and nuclear were on the rebound.

“What a difference a day makes,” writes Mizuho’s Daniel O’Regan. “We are seeing the exact opposite price action of the last few days with crowded longs, high beta fliers and meme stocks regaining lost momentum.”

O’Regan writes that based on client conversations, he feels like many of the moves are driven by quantitative traders, commodity trading advisors, and rebalancing, rather than active managers. He adds that most clients he talks to are waiting for pullbacks in high-quality stocks as we head into the heart of earnings season.

JPM,"Once a Tesla fan, Trump is now hobbling its profits",Financial Services,"Synopsis

Elon Musk's initial closeness to President Trump in early 2025 has soured, with Trump's policies now negatively impacting Tesla's profits. The end of EV tax credits, increased tariffs on imported components, and dwindling regulatory credit sales have significantly eroded Tesla's profitability despite record revenues.

When Donald Trump returned to the White House in early 2025, few corporate leaders appeared closer to him than Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO had not only advised Trump but even shared public displays of camaraderie. Investors assumed that Musk’s closeness to the US President would translate into policy advantages for Tesla, the world’s most valuable electric-vehicle company.

In March 2025, Trump turned the South Lawn of the White House into a temporary Tesla showroom in a conspicuous favour to his then adviser Musk. Tesla delivered five of its vehicles to the White House and parked them on a driveway for Trump to personally inspect. As a show of support for Tesla, Trump also bought a Tesla Model S outside the White House in the presence of Musk. Months later, when Musk has distanced himself from Trump after a bitter fallout, Trump's policies are adversely affecting the profits of Tesla

Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings showed record revenues yet sharply lower profits, as the very policies of the Trump administration now weigh on the company’s performance. Instead of benefiting from political friendship, Tesla finds itself caught in a tightening web of tariff costs, shrinking incentives and evaporating regulatory credits.

The end of incentives and the demand squeeze

Live Events

For more than a decade, federal tax credits have been the engine behind America’s electric-vehicle boom. Buyers of new EVs could claim up to $7,500 in credits, keeping Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y among the country’s top-selling cars. That incentive, first passed in 2008 and extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was crucial to maintaining steady consumer demand.

Trump’s tax-cut and spending law, signed in July 2025, abruptly ended that support by setting a September 30 expiration for the credit. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, Tesla enjoyed a rush of orders as consumers raced to secure the subsidy. But that was a one-time surge. With the incentive gone, sales momentum is already softening, and analysts expect electric-vehicle registrations to drop sharply through the end of the year.

Tesla’s third-quarter results tell the story in numbers. Revenue climbed 12 percent to $28.1 billion but profits fell 37 percent to $1.4 billion. The surge in revenue reflected the final burst of subsidised sales, while the profit decline reflected the higher costs of doing business in Trump’s America.

How tariffs and trade wars weigh on Tesla

Although Tesla builds all its U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, its supply chain stretches across continents. The company depends on imported components, including battery minerals and electronic systems sourced from Asia and South America. Trump’s aggressive trade policies, reviving tariffs on auto parts and raw materials, have driven up those costs substantially.

Tesla’s chief financial officer revealed that tariffs added more than $400 million in expenses during the third quarter alone. These import levies hit at every level of Tesla’s production, from nickel and lithium shipments to specialised semiconductors. Even as Tesla accelerates its efforts to localise production, the sudden increase in input costs has eroded margins and dented profitability.

Trump’s trade war has also disrupted global logistics. Tesla’s factories in Germany and China, which supply vehicles and components to various markets, are facing bottlenecks and higher transport costs due to retaliatory tariffs and supply restrictions. The administration’s insistence on reshoring production may appeal politically, but for a company like Tesla with an international manufacturing footprint, it has translated into an expensive logistical puzzle.

Fading regulatory credits

For years, Tesla relied on the sale of environmental and fuel-efficiency credits to other automakers as a lucrative source. Those credits, essentially payments from polluting rivals, often turned unprofitable quarters into profitable ones. But under Trump, the government has relaxed enforcement of fuel-efficiency penalties, allowing legacy automakers to pollute more without paying steep fines. That means fewer companies now need to buy Tesla’s credits and that once-reliable income stream is dwindling fast.

The fall in credit revenue, combined with rising costs and the end of the consumer tax break, has transformed Tesla’s financial profile. What investors once viewed as a politically sheltered company now looks increasingly exposed to Trump's policy swings. The public fallout between Musk and Trump over the summer, after Musk distanced himself from the administration, only intensified the perception that Tesla is now on the wrong side of the White House.

Tesla's future hinges on innovation

Tesla’s experience in 2025 is a sharp reminder that political proximity can be a double-edged sword. The early belief that Musk’s relationship with Trump would bring regulatory advantages has proved misplaced. Instead, the administration’s broader agenda, whcih includes cutting EV incentives, easing fuel-efficiency rules, and waging trade wars, has struck directly at Tesla’s core business model.

Musk, once eager to align himself with the president, now faces the consequences of that gamble. The company’s record revenues mask deepening vulnerabilities such as a fading policy cushion, rising production costs and an uncertain demand outlook. Going forward, investors will expect Tesla's success to stem from company’s ability to innovate, adapt and operate profitably in a far less forgiving atmosphere.

JPM,“You Gotta Love It When Life Comes Full Circle.” A MAJOR Celebrity Announces NEW Deal With Six Flags Theme Parks,Financial Services,"Some partnerships just make perfect sense. Disney X LEGO? That’s a match made in toy heaven. Benson Boone X Crumbl Cookies? We see the vision. But the latest pop culture partnership — Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs X Six Flags theme parks — is quite the surprise.

On October 21st, the JANA Partners investment firm announced it is partnering with Travis Kelce (who is currently engaged to Taylor Swift, by the way) to “enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience” at Six Flags theme parks.

Kelce released a statement on social media, reading, “To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families! Excited to partner with JANA Partners as an investor in Six Flags. So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.”

As it turns out, Kelce has been a fan of theme parks — specifically Six Flags — for a long time. In a new press release, he stated, “I am a lifelong Six Flags fan and grew up going to these parks with my family and friends,” adding, “The chance to help make Six Flags special for the next generation is one I couldn’t pass up.”

In a New Heights podcast episode, Kelce further detailed his love of theme parks. Kelce was raised in Ohio and grew up going to Cedar Point amusement park. Cedar Point’s parent company is Cedar Fair, which merged with Six Flags in 2024. Kelce’s brother, Jason, explains on the New Heights podcast that “Cedar Point is rollercoaster U.S.A.,” adding, “It is the premier roller coaster amusement park in the country.”

@traviskelce

To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families! Excited to partner with JANA Partners as an investor in Six Flags. So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.

This news comes amid a flurry of headlines about Six Flags theme parks closing around the U.S.

Several Six Flags locations have announced closures, including Six Flags America in Maryland and Six Flags Great America in California (unless they extend their lease). Four other theme parks have been closed by the company in the past:

Six Flags AstroWorld was located in Houston, Texas

Six Flags AutoWorld theme park in Flint, Michigan

Six Flags New Orleans

Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom

Six Flags CEO Richard Zimmerman announced plans to step down by the end of the year following low second-quarter earnings; the company reported a $100 million loss within three months.

Why Six Flags Had To Close 7 Theme Parks

Could this new partnership boost profits for Six Flags? Kelce has not revealed how he plans to work with the company going forward. Kelce and the JANA Partners investment firm collectively own about 9% of the economic interest in the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation.

Well, we didn’t see this news coming! We’ll be curious to see how this new partnership changes things for Six Flags. In the meantime, we’re always on the lookout for the latest theme park news, so stay tuned for more.

XOM,"Some marketers are proudly touting anti-AI campaigns, but those promises could put them in a tricky spot down the road",Energy,"I'm closing my eyes and letting AI take the wheel. That's the proposed future for GM, where executives are touting a new ""eyes-off"" self-driving feature launching in 2028. Nothing like a little cat nap when you're hitting 80 mph on the highway.

In today's big story, a portion of Corporate America is proud to tell you how it's avoiding AI. But executives' deep buy-in of the tech might make its arrival inevitable.

What's on deck:

Markets: Steve Cohen's Point72 shook up its top quant unit. Here's how it all went down.

Tech: The great flattening just came for Google's ad division.

Business: If you haven't secured a ""KPop Demon Hunter"" Halloween costume yet, you might be out of luck. (Please don't tell my three-year-old.)

But first, all in on not going all-in.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.

The big story

OnlyHumans

A human wrote the sentence you are currently reading. Is that a good enough reason for you to stick around?

That's the strategy behind some big-name corporate brands. While a good chunk of businesses tout their use of AI, another cohort is proudly declaring they're against it.

(Side note: If you'd actually prefer a robot wrote this newsletter, please don't share that opinion with my bosses.)

Aerie, Heineken, and DC Comics are some of the brands shouting from the rooftops (or massive billboards) about their anti-AI stance, writes BI's Lara O'Reilly and Jordan Hart.

For these companies, it's a bet that promoting human authenticity will resonate with people who are growing tired of AI infiltrating all aspects of life.

Finding that human-AI balance was a key theme at Advertising Week New York, Lara previously reported. And even those on the cutting edge of AI seem to recognize the need to tap into the human element.

Just look at this ad from OpenAI of a guy trying to do pull-ups. How very relatable and human!

Of course, there's no guarantee people are buying it.

""Would you like me to go ahead and do the workout for you?"" reads one of the top comments on YouTube.

The anti-AI companies are toeing a fine line.

While most people have some level of AI fatigue — I'm sick of getting tricked by those fake, AI-generated post-game press conferences — it also seems foolish to disregard the technology altogether.

The benefits of leveraging AI to some degree are undeniable, and dismissing that could be a grave mistake. Some might argue that a purely human approach in a world full of AI is a differentiator, like a restaurant sourcing all its ingredients from a local farm.

But while that business model might work on a small scale, the bigger you are the harder it becomes. That's especially true if your rivals are willing to dive into the AI pool headfirst.

Marketers could also be doing a bit of self-preservation. The more you proclaim the importance of marketing your company as human-first, the more job security you give yourself.

However, one study hints at the inevitability of AI adoption. The survey found 87% of executives use AI on the job, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman. That's compared to just 57% usage among managers and 27% of employees using it.

The split shows how those at the top of orgs are the biggest proponents of the tech. But that doesn't make the adoption any easier, as Sarah covered in the deep divide taking place at video-game giant Electronic Arts.

3 things in markets

1. Behind the shocking shakeup at Steve Cohen's top quant unit. The surprising ouster of Cubist president Denis Dancanet followed months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top leader, people familiar with the matter said. Cubist is the roughly $7 billion quant division of Cohen's hedge fund Point72. Here's how it all unfolded.

2. Beyond Meat's meme-stock craze might be starting to spoil. Shares in the buzzy plant-based meat company finished down 1% on Wednesday and fell a further 20% in early trading on Thursday. Two options trading data points — and even the retail trader driving Beyond Meat's rally — suggest investors should be cautious.

3. Why gold's record-breaking rally has stalled out. After repeatedly hitting all-time highs over the course of a month, the precious metal has recently retreated. Market experts say gold's decline is likely driven by technical factors.

3 things in tech

1. Google is stripping back management layers (again). In a memo sent to staff last month, the search giant said it was eliminating a middle-management layer in its US ads business. The move is part of Google's larger efforts to speed up decisions and cut bureaucracy, and it reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech.

2. Meta's AI layoffs, in its own words. Chief AI officer Alexandr Wang said the cuts, which affect 600 Superintelligence Labs employees, will help the company make decisions more quickly. Read the full memo.

3. Amazon is taking the L in AI, but can it bounce back? Bernstein's Mark Shmulik — a top Wall Street tech analyst — said in a note that while AWS might be last in the AI race, it's not dead yet. Shmulik said AWS is showing early signs of progress, and its partnership with Anthropic is promising.

3 things in business

1. Tesla's record quarterly revenue wasn't enough for Wall Street. The EV giant's profit came in below analyst expectations, causing the stock to decline in after-hours trading. Elon Musk also railed against the major proxy firms opposing his proposed pay package, calling them ""corporate terrorists.""

2. Good luck finding a ""KPop Demon Hunters"" Halloween costume. Looks like Netflix really underestimated demand: The officially licensed costumes by Spirit Halloween are sold out online and in most stores. However, unlicensed dupes abound on sites like Etsy and Amazon.

3. It may be the toughest season ever for 'Shark Tank' contestants. Why? Because Tariffs are screwing up the show's usual playbook, BI's Katherine Li writes. For businesses that rely on global supply chains, the cost of production and projected profits may have collapsed between their on-camera pitch and the time their episode airs.

XOM,Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Skids After Earnings Miss,Energy,"Tesla (TSLA) shares fell Thursday morning after the company's quarterly profit came in short of analysts' estimates, even as it returned to revenue growth following two quarters of declines.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share in the period, missing the average Wall Street estimate of 54 cents a share. Lower EV prices and higher operating costs tied to restructuring and AI investments dented the bottom line. CEO Elon Musk told analysts that Tesla is at a ""critical inflection point"" as it focuses on its next phase of growth, which will center on “real-world” applications of AI, including self-driving cars and smart robots.

Tesla shares were down 5% at around $418 in the opening minutes of Thursday's session. The stock, which was the top performer among Magnificent Seven stocks in the third quarter, was up 9% for the year through Wednesday's close.

Below, we break down the technicals on Tesla’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for.

Pennant Pattern Breakdown

After hitting their 2025 high earlier this month, Tesla shares have consolidated within a pennant, a chart pattern signaling a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend.

However, the price looks set to break down below the pattern in Thursday’s trading session following the weaker-than-expected earnings, suggesting waning bullish momentum and the potential for a near-term pullback.

It’s also worth noting that volume has declined during the pennant pattern, indicating a lack of conviction among buyers and sellers ahead of the company’s quarterly results.

Let’s identify three key support levels to watch on Tesla’s chart if the shares lose ground and also point out a zone of resistance worth monitoring during potential upswings in the stock.

Key Support Levels to Watch

The first level to watch sits around $360. This area, roughly midway between the 50- and 200-day moving averages, would likely attract buyers’ attention near a trendline that links a series of peaks on the chart between November and August.

Selling below this level could see the shares retreat toward $292. The price may find support in this location near the March countertrend high and a cluster of trading activity spanning from April to July.

A more-significant retracement may spark a decline to the $267 level. Investors could see this as a high probability buying area near three prominent peaks that formed on the chart in July, September, and October last year.

Zone of Resistance Worth Monitoring

During upswings in Tesla shares, investors should keep a close eye on a zone of resistance between $465 and $489. Those who have purchased at lower prices may seek exit points in this region near the top of the pennant pattern and the stock’s record high.

XOM,US stocks open flat as poor earnings dampen investor mood,Energy,"Synopsis

Wall Street opened flat on Thursday as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM dampened investor mood, while brewing trade tensions between the U.S. and China threatened to deepen the market's unease.

Wall Street was largely muted on Thursday, as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM cast a shadow over risk appetite, while investors kept a close eye on simmering U.S.-China trade tensions.

Tesla's third-quarter profit missed expectations, dragging its shares down 5.3%. A revenue beat offered little relief, as Wall Street grappled with tempered optimism through the week.

The electric-vehicle maker kicked off earnings for the ""Magnificent Seven"" — a cohort that forms nearly 35% of S&P 500's weight, and could dictate the market's next move.

IBM dropped 5.4% after the company recorded a slowdown in growth in its key cloud software segment, eclipsing a third-quarter beat.

Amid a whirlwind of earnings reports, profit-taking and escalating trade tensions, the equity rally is showing signs of fatigue.

Live Events

While most companies have outpaced analyst estimates, cautious outlooks have cast a shadow as investors look for justification behind sky-high equity valuations.

""The numbers are not high profile enough and not rampant enough to really drive a market through these big milestones,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.

""The caution does feed in and big earnings are to come through next week and that might just be the wait and see approach.""

At 09:38 a.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 41.34 points, or 0.10%, to 46,631.75, the S&P 500 gained 11.93 points, or 0.18%, to 6,711.33 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 23.30 points, or 0.09%, to 22,760.43.

Quantum computing firms were a bright spot after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was in talks with several of them to take equity stakes in exchange for federal funding.

IonQ and D-Wave Quantum gained 5.7% and 15.6%, respectively, while Rigetti Computing added 8%.

Energy stocks added 1.2% following a jump in crude prices on fresh U.S. sanctions against Russia. Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Halliburton rose between 1% and 2.1%.

Health insurer Molina Healthcare plunged 20.9% after slashing its annual profit forecast. Peers Centene and UnitedHealth fell 6.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

S&P Industrials index rose 0.8% after a slew of earnings. Honeywell raised its annual profit forecast on strong aerospace demand, sending its shares up 5%.

American Airlines shares gained 3.6% after the carrier raised its profit forecast for the year, while Southwest Airlines slipped 3.7% despite a surprise quarterly profit.

T-Mobile dipped 2.3% despite adding more-than-expected wireless subscribers during the third quarter.

DATA DROUGHT DRAGS ON

With the U.S. government shutdown entering its twenty-third day, key economic releases, including Thursday's usual reading of weekly jobless claims data, remain frozen, leaving investors without crucial signals.

That puts Friday's core CPI print, expected to hold steady at 3.1%, in sharp focus as the Federal Reserve's only clear inflation guide ahead of next week's policy meeting.

Markets have already priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut, with traders betting the Fed will ease again in December.

Meanwhile, a Reuters report said the Trump administration was weighing sweeping curbs on high-tech exports to China in retaliation for Beijing's latest restrictions on rare-earth shipments. The report injected fresh uncertainty into the markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.66-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 32 new lows.

XOM,"What’s up with… Nokia, Orange, mobile security",Energy,"In today’s industry news roundup: Nokia’s third-quarter financials surprise analysts, with booming demand for AI, cloud and 5G putting the company back on track following its profit warning in July; Orange CEO doubles down on consolidation hopes as she reports overall third-quarter revenue and EBITDal growth and claims 300 million customers worldwide; Verizon’s recent Mobile Security Index finds mobile attacks are on the rise, with the threat made worse by the growing use of AI by employees in the workplace; and much more!

Nokia remains on track to achieve its full-year outlook after reporting third-quarter results that certainly seem to have come as a pleasant surprise to analysts, with AI and cloud business providing a welcome boost.As noted by Reuters, the comparable operating profit in the quarter to the end of September reached €435m, while analysts polled by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) expected this metric to reach €342m. The Finland-based vendor appears to be back on a more even keel following a difficult first six months of the year. Indeed, the vendor hadissued a profit warning in July, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. Its outlook now remains unchanged for 2025 as a whole, although it has revised upwards the operating profit outlook by €0.1bn, to between €1.7bn and €2.2bn. This is owing to a change in venture fund reporting after Nokia decided to scale down its passive venture fund investments. In the third quarter, net sales rose 9% to €4.83bn on a comparable basis, said to be aided by strong growth in optical networks and cloud services. In a statement, Nokia president and CEO Justin Hotard said network infrastructure “delivered 11% net sales growth. Optical networks grew 19%, coming largely from AI and cloud customers”. Nokia noted that AI and cloud customers accounted for 6% of net sales at group level, and 14% of network infrastructure sales. According to the Reuters report, Hotard told journalists that AI and datacentre demand “continues to be robust. In fact, it continues to accelerate from our perspective”. Net sales from cloud and network services increased by 13% as “operator investments in 5G core remain strong”, said Hotard. “Our cloud-native 5G core offering continues to gain traction and we are gaining market share”, he added. Hotard highlighted, in particular,the recent deal with VodafoneThree that marked Nokia’s re-entry as a RAN supplier in the UK market for both Vodafone and Three’s combined network operations following their recent merger. For more details about Nokia’s results, seethis press release.

This week has also seen a smattering ofthird-quarter results from telcos, including Orange, which released its figures on Thursday. During the earnings call, Orange Group CEO Christel Heydemann wasted no time in addressing the France-based operator’s consolidation ambitions following its recent€17bn joint takeover offer for certain activities of Alice France, including SFR. The non-binding offer by Bouygues Telecom, Iliad (Free) and Orange was swiftly rejected by Altice, but the trio has indicated that it intends to continue negotiations to see if an agreement can be reached. According to Heydemann, “this deal would allow us to strengthen investments in France while maintaining a competitive ecosystem for the benefit of consumers”. She also stressed there is “no certainty that we will reach an agreement, and we are willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Altice group”. Turning to Orange’s financial performance, Heydemann painted a broadly positive picture for the third quarter, noting that both revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation after lease (EBITDAaL) expenses increased in the three months to 30 September 2025. In fact, EBITDAaL rose by a reasonably healthy 3.7% on a comparable basis to €3.44bn, prompting Orange to increase its annual guidance to at least 3.5%. Revenue rose by a somewhat lower rate of 0.8% to €9.99bn. Heydemann also pointed out that Orange has now passed the “symbolic threshold of 300 million customers worldwide”. In terms of group segments, Africa and the Middle East remained a growth driver, as has now been the case for several quarters. This region saw revenue rise by 12.2% owing to a 13.1% increase in retail revenues, marking 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Orange’s domestic market, France, saw revenue fall by 3.7% on a comparable basis to €4.34bn, blamed in part on the “anticipated decline” in wholesale. At the same time, Orange said mobile net additions in France have reached their highest level since 2022. Excluding France, the Europe segment saw a return to revenue growth with an increase of 4.7%, largely owing to retail services growth. Orange Business, however, remains a work in progress, reporting a 4.3% decline in revenue. The operator described the IT services market as “challenging”, whereas Orange Cyberdefense continued to shine, with a 6.3% revenue increase in the first nine months of the year. For more details about Orange’s results, see this press release.

The various flavours of AI may be good for business, as highlighted by Nokia above, but it also brings a growing level of risk for mobile devices, according to a new report from Verizon Business. TheVerizon 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) reveals that mobile devices are “under attack, now more than ever, with 85% of organisations reporting increasing mobile attacks”. Although 75% of organisations are said to have upped their mobile security spending over the past year, the increase in the number of employees using generative AI services for work purposes “is quickly expanding the attack surface”, the report warns. It notes that 34% of organisations “fear that more sophisticated and large-scale AI-powered attacks will significantly increase their risk, and 38% believe ransomware will become even more dangerous when powered by AI”. Chris Novak, VP of global cybersecurity solutions at Verizon Business, declared that this year’s Mobile Security Index “is a clear wake-up call: Mobile security is no longer a perimeter defence but a battle fought in the palm of every employee’s hand. We talk about the perfect storm: With the rise of AI, we’re witnessing a Category 5 hurricane in mobile security, where AI is the wind – and human error is the open window”. For more details about the report’s findings, seethis press release. The report can also be found using this link.

Alternative pan-European long-distance network operatorEXA Infrastructure is maintaining its recent busy streak.

XOM,European markets rise after major earnings reports; Gucci-owner Kering surges 9%,Energy,"Brendan McDermid | Reuters

LONDON — European stocks ended Thursday in positive territory as investors looked to earnings reports for clues on business activity and confidence in the region.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the session up 0.4%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index added 0.7%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.2%, and Italy's FTSE MIB also saw gains of 0.4%. Germany's DAX also edged higher, ending up 0.3%.

It was a busy day for earnings in Europe with Kering , Roche Holding , Unilever , Vinci , Thales , LSEG , Dassault Systemes , Antofagasta , Swedbank, Nokia and Lloyds Banking Group among the big names reporting third-quarter figures.

Enterprise software firm SAP released earnings late on Wednesday, which missed analyst expectations. The German company reported a 7% increase in revenue for the third quarter of 9.08 billion euros ($10.53 billion), below expectations of 9.15 billion euros ($7.96 billion), according to consensus figures compiled by LSEG.

However, it saw gains of 22% in its cloud revenue, with CEO Christian Klein putting it down to increasing AI and data cloud market share.

""For Q4 we are executing against a strong pipeline - which gives us confidence in our accelerating total revenue growth ambition for 2026,"" he said in a statement. SAP's shares ended the session up 2.2%.

Gucci-owner Kering also reported after the bell on Wednesday. The group's revenue totaled 3.4 billion euros in the quarter, down 5% on a comparable basis but it beat expectations of 3.31 billion euros, per a consensus compiled by FactSet. Gucci sales — which typically make up close to half of Kering's total revenues — came in just shy of forecasts at 1.3 billion euros, down 14% on a comparable basis on the year before. Its shares closed 8.7% higher.

In financial services, Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday reported pre-tax profit of almost £1.2 billion, slightly higher than consensus estimates of about £1 billion, but down from the £1.8 billion of the same period last year. It comes after the British lender announced earlier this month an additional £800 million charge relating to customer compensation arising from the U.K. car finance misselling scandal. Its shares were up 1.2% at the closing bell.

Shares in Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) lost 0.1% as its net interest income reached 10.4 billion Swedish krona during the third quarter, beating the 10.2 Swedish krona predicted by analysts. The bank's quarterly-earnings report showed net profits of 7.68 billion Swedish krona for the three-month period, missing the 7.86 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts, according to LSEG estimates.

The bank saw net interest income reach 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above analyst estimates of 10.7 billion Swedish krona.

Attention turns to energy

Oil prices were in focus Thursday after they jumped around 3% in the previous session when the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The commodity was up by more than 5% in afternoon trade.

The administration cited Moscow's ""lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.""

European Union member states also approved new sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, to be formally adopted today, including a ban on liquefied natural gas imports further as the bloc ramps up efforts to decouple its energy supply from Russian oil and gas.

""We really want to deprive Russia of the means to fund this war to end this war,"" Kaja Kallas, European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and vice president of the European Commission, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

The continent has made progress on this, Kallas noted, but ""not all the member states are there,"" she said. ""So the criticism that we have heard, also from the United States, regarding some of our member states still buying oil and gas, it's very relevant,"" she added.

Kallas spoke ahead of an EU leaders' summit on Thursday, where further measures will be discussed. Brussels will also discuss using frozen Russian assets as a reparations loan to support Ukraine.

Broader Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell, tracking Wall Street's declines on Wednesday on concerns about U.S.-China trade relations. Trade fears resurfaced after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering curbs on exports to China that are made with U.S. software, citing a U.S. official and three people briefed by U.S. authorities.

U.S. stock markets were in positive territory as investors digested quarterly earnings releases that came out after the previous market close, including from Tesla, IBM, Moderna and Lam Research.

XOM,Should You Hold Booking Holdings (BKNG)?,Energy,"Wedgewood Partners, an investment management company, released its third-quarter 2025 investor letter. The letter is available for download here. AI stocks remain the favorite topic of Wall Street in the third quarter. In the third quarter, Wedgewood Composite’s net return was 5.9% compared to the Standard & Poor’s 8.1%, the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 10.5%, and the Russell 1000 Value Index’s 5.3% return for the same period.

In its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners highlighted stocks such as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). Headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides online travel and restaurant booking services. The one-month return of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was -5.34%, and its shares gained 21.27% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 22, 2025, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock closed at $5,230.59 per share, with a market capitalization of $169.523 billion.

Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:

""Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) also detracted from performance during the quarter. Revenues grew +16% and earnings per share were up +32% on strong room night growth in its ex-U.S. markets. The Company derives over +60% of its bookings from travelers who go directly to the booking.com app or website. This has freed up advertising cash low to reinvest in distribution across search engines, social media, and now agentic commerce through OpenAI's ""Operator."" Booking's focus on fragmented hotel suppliers in ex-U.S. markets is quite differentiated, so much so that it has allowed it to amass scale in areas that competitors simply have trouble reaching. The Company's obsessive focus on generating attractive returns from advertising has also been a key driver of its success, and that should continue to be beneficial to shareholders, regardless of the marketing channel consumers choose.""",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-23T13:46:29Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hold-booking-holdings-bkng-134629426.html,0.6,2025-10-24 22:27:41.868547,0.9999999999999999,

“There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane,” Musk said, interrupting his chief financial officer as the more than hour-long call wrapped up.

It was classic Musk: a fiery end to what had otherwise been a ho-hum call largely devoted to Tesla’s artificial intelligence, humanoid robot and self-driving initiatives. Shareholders will vote on the pay package at Tesla’s Nov. 6 annual meeting in Austin.

Tesla’s earnings report was largely disappointing, with profit missing estimates despite record vehicle deliveries. Operating income plunged 40% in the third quarter, reflecting ongoing strains on an electric-vehicle business that’s being buffeted by changing US policies.

Costs are rising sharply for Tesla, with tariffs taking a more than $400 million toll on last quarter’s results. Operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the period.

Tesla shares dropped as much as 5.7% shortly after the start of regular trading Thursday. The stock is up almost 9% for the year, trailing the 14% advance by the S&P 500 Index.

‘Unmitigated Concerns’

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the unprecedented payout to Musk, the value of which is dependent on Tesla reaching market value thresholds and operational milestones. ISS cited “unmitigated concerns” with the magnitude and design of the award, while Glass Lewis took issue with its potential to dilute other shareholders’ ownership.

Musk emphasized, as he has in the past, that sufficient voting control matters more to him than monetary compensation from Tesla.

“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” he said.

XOM,How To Earn $500 A Month From Ford Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings,Energy,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Oct. 23.

In the meantime, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. The carmaker currently offers an annual dividend yield of 4.83%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year).

So, how can investors capitalize on its dividend yield to earn a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $124,300 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $24,860 or around 2,000 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

Ford Price Action

Shares of Ford fell 1% to close at $12.43 on Wednesday.

Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at 36 cents per share. That’s down from 49 cents per share in the year-ago period.

The consensus estimate for Ford's quarterly revenue is $43.86 billion, compared to $43.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters. It also exceeded estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.

Net income rose to $1.74 billion, reversing a loss from a year earlier. IBM also raised its full-year revenue growth target to more than 5% and lifted free cash flow guidance to $14 billion.

Still, investors appeared concerned about the pace of software expansion. Software sales grew 10% year over year to $7.2 billion, matching forecasts but falling short of more bullish hopes. The Red Hat unit, a key driver of IBM's AI and hybrid-cloud strategy, showed signs of slowing momentum, which analysts said could weigh on sentiment.

XOM,Elon Musk Begged For His $1 Trillion Pay Package During Tesla's Q3 Earnings Call,Energy,"With a net worth of over $487 billion, Elon Musk is already the richest guy in the world, but that immense wealth didn't stop him from panhandling during Tesla's third-quarter earnings meeting for the approval of his proposed $1 trillion pay package. He also took the time to blast the shareholders and advisory firms that have come out against the proposal.

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the massive payout to Musk. The value of the package is dependent on the automaker reaching a litany of market value goals and operational thresholds — most of which aren't really achievable. From Bloomberg:

""There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not not so much that I can't be fired if I go insane,"" Musk said, interrupting his chief financial officer as the more than hour-long call wrapped up.

It was classic Musk: a fiery end to what had otherwise been a ho-hum earnings call largely devoted to Tesla's artificial intelligence, humanoid robot and self-driving initiatives. Shareholders will vote on the pay package at Tesla's Nov. 6 annual meeting in Austin.

Musk emphasized, as he has in the past, that sufficient voting control matters more to him than monetary compensation from Tesla.

""I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,"" he said.

After Musk's little rant concluded, CFO Vaibhav Taneja resumed his closing remarks by praising the ""amazing job"" the special board committee did in constructing the pay package. He made it clear that nothing would get approved until shareholders ""made substantial returns,"" but he did kowtow to Musk by urging said shareholders two more times to vote in favor of the plan.

As we've previously reported, if the package is approved, Musk could still be in line for billions even if his misses nearly all of the goals laid out for him. It's a pretty sweet deal. I'd also be on my hands and knees begging for it.

Tesla had a very weird third quarter. Its net income fell 37% in the three months leading up to September 30 to $1.39 billion. However, revenue rose sharply as buyers in the U.S. flocked to dealers, looking to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit that Musk's old friend, President Donald Trump, personally killed.

The Austin, Texas-based automaker delivered a record 497,099 vehicles in Q3, raising Tesla's revenue 12% to $28.1 billion. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2 billion, and energy revenue rose 44% to $3.42 billion. Services and other revenues also rose $25% to $3.48 billion, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Tesla. From Automotive News:

Tesla said its total gross margin fell to 18 percent from 19.8 percent in the same quarter last year.

[...]

""While we face near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy, we are focused on long-term growth and value creation,"" Tesla said in its third-quarter earnings report.

Analysts had expected Tesla to report revenue of $26.2 billion in the July-September quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG cited by Reuters.

Musk didn't just use the forum to beg for money. He also talked about the lofty (and fairly unattainable) autonomy goals he has set for the company.

CEO Elon Musk on the Oct. 22 earnings call said that vehicle production will expand once Tesla can offer customers a fully autonomous option that no longer requires the driver to pay attention to the road. That will happen shortly with its still-incomplete Full Self-Driving software, he said.

""Really what it comes down to is: can you text while in the car? And if you tell someone yes, that the car is now so good you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you're in the car, anyone who can buy the car, will buy the car,"" Musk said.

[...]

Musk said on the call that demand next year will also be bolstered by the launch of its dedicated CyberCab robotaxi, which won't have human controls. The CyberCab will be used in Tesla's ride-hailing fleet and go on sale to customers, Musk has said.

[...]

""We are expecting to have no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year,"" Musk said on the call. ""And then we do expect to be operating robotaxis in I think about eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year.""

Musk said in July that he expected fully autonomous Tesla robotaxis to serve half the U.S. population by the end of this year.

Musk says the robotaxi rollout is going to be dependent on regulatory approval. Yeah, bud. I'd certainly hope so.

He also talked about the Optimus robot, but it's such a pie-in-the-sky idea, I'm not going to waste your time going over it.

Tesla's deliveries for 2025 are expected to slip to about 1.6 million vehicles — down about 200,000 from 2024.

Volvo's cost-cutting measures seemed to have worked and then some. The automaker just smashed third-quarter profit forecasts despite tariff concerns and tough competition. Its new management — led by CEO Hakan Samuelsson, who returned earlier this year — has spent the past six months slashing costs at the company to counteract stumbling profits. From Reuters:

The company cut 3,000 jobs, pulled guidance and slowed investments to offset pressure from U.S. tariffs, fierce competition and an EV market slowdown.

""What we're now seeing is really, wow okay, this is delivering faster than we thought and faster than we planned,"" Samuelsson said of the cost reductions.

Volvo Cars, based in Sweden but majority-owned by China's Geely Holding, said it made an operating profit before one-off costs of 5.9 billion Swedish crowns ($627 million) in July-September, soaring above analysts' consensus forecast of 1.6 billion crowns, according to Bernstein.

This was despite a 7% drop in sales, with fully electric cars still accounting for less than a quarter of the total.

All in all, Volvo's gross margin rose 24.4% from the second quarter's 17.7% Samulsson said a facelift of the XC60 (which will soon be built in the U.S.) was a big reason for that, along with savings from cooperation with Geely's supply chain as well as the cost-cutting measures they put in place.

Not everybody is having as good a day as Volvo, though. Production at Volkswagen's main plant in Germany will proceed as planned next week, but after that, who the hell knows what'll happen? The issue stems from the risk of a microchip shortage due to a standoff between China and the Netherlands, having to do with chip supplier Nexperia. From Reuters:

The company has no current plans to launch a state-backed reduced working hours scheme at its main Wolfsburg plant near its headquarters due to the risk of microchip shortages, the person also said.

The company is, however, in precautionary discussions with the German labour agency over drawing on the option later, the source added.

As we reported yesterday, other automakers around the globe have urged the two sides to come to a quick resolution on the matter. I'm sure you remember what happened the last time there was an industry-wide microchip shortage. There were thousands of cars that were either not shipped from factories or shipped without key functions. It wasn't a good situation, and I'm sure everybody would like to avoid that scenario again

After noting it launched a ""ride-hailing service in the Bay Area using Robotaxi technology,"" CEO Elon Musk gave investors a few updates on Robotaxis.

“We are expecting to have no safety drivers in large parts of Austin by the end of this year … We are being very cautious about the deployment,"" Musk said on the earnings conference call following the report. Musk added that Tesla aims to launch Robotaxi tests in eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year, including in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona.

Tesla stock was down over 5% in early trade on Thursday.

""The company is hyper-aware of media sensitivity and potential regulatory backlash if anything goes wrong, so it is proceeding with extreme caution,"" Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note following the call. ""The Tesla story, and valuation multiple, rely on seamless execution rolling out revolutionary technology.""

""Real-world A.I. remains Tesla's ace in the hole, with the potential to unlock incalculably large markets (in Elon's words, the ""infinite money glitch""),"" Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note to investors.

Tesla launched its first Robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, over the summer and expanded its service area a few weeks later; however, a safety driver still remains in each Robotaxi.

Tesla has been testing a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the cars are driven by people. The tests and comments coming from Tesla have alarmed local officials in California.

For the quarter, Tesla reported Q3 revenue of $28.01 billion, compared to $26.27 billion expected, per Bloomberg, a 12% jump from the $25.18 billion reported a year ago. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50, compared to $0.54 estimated earnings, translating to EBITDA of $4.23 billion, versus expectations of $3.78 billion. Operating profit fell 40% from a year ago to $1.624 billion.

Tesla also said that lower regulatory emissions credit revenue weighed on its profitability.

Tesla’s Q3 earnings report comes as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) are within striking distance of new highs. The broader market has shaken off President Trump’s unpredictable tariff war, though fears of an economic slowdown in the US persist. Plus, auto sector tariffs of 25% on imported cars and parts are still in place, hurting domestic automakers.

Tesla noted on the conference call that its tariff hit in Q3 rose to $400 million; the company posted a $300 million tariff hit in Q2.

""Both deliveries and free cash flow were all-time records, but admittedly, this backdrop didn't translate into as much upside as we had expected. Headwinds included tariffs, mix, restructuring, and a higher tax rate,"" Piper Sandler's Potter added.

Earlier this month, Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company. The company also deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.

However, the sales surge came before the expiry of the US federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, the last day of the quarter. Even Tesla believes the company could be in for a tough time after expiration.

One of the moves Tesla made earlier in October to address affordability was the introduction of a stripped-down “standard” version of its Model Y and Model 3 sedans. Both models feature rear-wheel drive, smaller batteries, less powerful motors, and the deletion of some creature comforts. The two cars cost $39,990 and $36,990, respectively.

Musk also made an unusual plea at the end of the earnings call, urging shareholders to approve his package claiming he wouldn't be comfortable building ""a robot army"" without over 20% voting control.

Musk’s current pay package is embroiled in a lawsuit in Delaware, where shareholders alleged they didn’t have enough information to properly vet the compensation awarded by the board, and a trial judge agreed. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently weighing the merits of Tesla’s appeal.

Musk’s newer package faces criticism as well. Independent proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS have both recommended that shareholders reject Musk’s latest proposed pay package.

XOM,"Tesla Q3 earnings miss analyst expectations, stock drops despite robotaxi expansion plans",Energy,"Tesla (TSLA) reported a third quarter earnings miss after the bell on Wednesday, with operating profit dropping 40% from a year ago as the company forges ahead in a post-EV tax credit environment, and revealing robotaxi progress that left investors wanting more.

After noting it launched a ""ride-hailing service in the Bay Area using Robotaxi technology,"" CEO Elon Musk gave investors a few updates on Robotaxis.

“We are expecting to have no safety drivers in large parts of Austin by the end of this year … We are being very cautious about the deployment,"" Musk said on the earnings conference call following the report. Musk added that Tesla aims to launch Robotaxi tests in eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year, including in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona.

Tesla stock was down over 5% in early trade on Thursday.

""The company is hyper-aware of media sensitivity and potential regulatory backlash if anything goes wrong, so it is proceeding with extreme caution,"" Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note following the call. ""The Tesla story, and valuation multiple, rely on seamless execution rolling out revolutionary technology.""

""Real-world A.I. remains Tesla's ace in the hole, with the potential to unlock incalculably large markets (in Elon's words, the ""infinite money glitch""),"" Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note to investors.

Tesla launched its first Robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, over the summer and expanded its service area a few weeks later; however, a safety driver still remains in each Robotaxi.

Tesla has been testing a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the cars are driven by people. The tests and comments coming from Tesla have alarmed local officials in California.

For the quarter, Tesla reported Q3 revenue of $28.01 billion, compared to $26.27 billion expected, per Bloomberg, a 12% jump from the $25.18 billion reported a year ago. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50, compared to $0.54 estimated earnings, translating to EBITDA of $4.23 billion, versus expectations of $3.78 billion. Operating profit fell 40% from a year ago to $1.624 billion.

Tesla also said that lower regulatory emissions credit revenue weighed on its profitability.

XOM,"US Stock Markets Today: S&P 500, Dow Jones Open Flat After Tesla Earnings",Energy,"S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat on Thursday after Tesla and IBM announced their third quarter earnings. Minutes into the trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 29.96 points or 0.08%, S&P 500 also rose over 0.13%, while Nasdaq was up 0.01%.

Tesla and IBM were down over 5% after announcing their earnings. Tesla’s profit plunged as rising costs undercut a record quarter of vehicle sales, exposing strains on its operations. Adjusted earnings were 50 cents a share in the period, down 31% from a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Tesla’s operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and it now estimates the impact of US tariffs was $400 million in the period.

This comes after wall street closed in the negative on Wednesday with Dow Jones down 0.7% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite seeing a decline of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively.

With employment remaining the biggest fear, “we don’t think the CPI number tomorrow will carry much weight as the Fed meeting starts next Tuesday,” Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities told Bloomberg.

In the early minutes of trading, nine of the 11 sectoral indices were trading in green. Energy and Industrial sectors led the advance, while consumer discretionary and consumer staples were the sectors in red.

Nike Inc., Amazon.com, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Boeing Co. were amongst the gainers for the day. On the other hand, McDonald's Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and Microsoft Corp. were in the red.

As the US market opened, spot gold rose 1% to $4,140.10 an ounce. Crude oil prices rose, with the West Texas trading 5.1% higher at $61.47 per barrel.

The Bloomberg Dollar Index was little changed, with the British Pound at $1.3345 and the Japanese yen fell 0.4% at 152.54 per dollar.

XOM,Rivian Announces Second Round of Layoffs in a Month as EV Industry Woes Deepen,Energy,"Electric truck maker Rivian is conducting another round of layoffs, cutting over 600 jobs, which amounts to four percent of its headcount, as the company tries to reduce costs amidst a pullback in the EV industry. This is the EV company’s second round of layoffs in a month.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Rivian, the electric vehicle manufacturer known for its pickup trucks and SUVs, is laying off more than 600 employees, representing around four percent of its total workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. The company had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year. This marks the second round of job cuts in a month, following a smaller layoff affecting 1.5 percent of its staff, which Rivian said was aimed at reducing costs ahead of launching a more affordable SUV in 2026.

The electric vehicle industry is facing significant challenges due to the rollback of policies that supported EV adoption. The expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers is expected to significantly impact sales. Furthermore, these policy changes have disrupted the market for compliance credits, which have been a crucial source of profitability for Rivian and other EV manufacturers. Rivian has estimated that the changes could result in approximately $100 million in revenue being delayed.

Despite a 32 percent increase in vehicle sales to 13,201 units in the third quarter, Rivian has lowered its full-year delivery guidance to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles, down from its previous forecast of up to 46,000 deliveries. The company is set to report its full quarterly earnings on November 4.

As a publicly-traded company since 2021, Rivian has been under pressure to reduce expenses while preparing for the launch of its next model, the R2 SUV. The R2 is expected to have a starting price of around $45,000, making it more affordable than the company’s current R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which start at $70,990 and $76,900, respectively. Rivian anticipates higher demand for the R2 compared to its current models.

Despite losing $1.1 billion in the second quarter, Rivian has stated that it has sufficient funds to launch the R2. However, the company recognizes the need to streamline its operations and reduce costs to navigate the challenging market conditions and ensure long-term success in the competitive electric vehicle industry.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe taunted proponents of gas-powered cars in 2023, when the Democrat plan to force EVs on Americans was in full swing:

Rivian CEO, RJ Scaringe, recently compared the purchase of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to “building a horse barn in 1910.”

Rivian exceeded market expectations by delivering 12,640 EVs in the second quarter of this year. The company is on track to meet its annual production guidance of 50,000 vehicles. “The performance and drivability of an EV makes it so much more desirable than an alternative,” Scaringe said. He added, “Buying a non-EV just feels very old,” adding that while the environmental responsibility is a factor, he also feels that regular ICE cars are boring.

XOM,Elon Musk defends $1 trillion pay package: ‘I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted’,Energy,"“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,” Musk said Wednesday on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call, referring to the proxy advisory services who are urging investors to reject the pay plan.

The proposal would award Musk up to $1 trillion in stock if he meets key performance targets, including growing the company to an $8.5 trillion market cap, more than a 500% increase from today’s valuation. Musk insisted the package isn’t about personal gain—but rather about ensuring he retains enough influence to steer Tesla’s next chapter, focused on AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. If approved, Musk’s stake could rise from 13% to nearly 29%.

“It’s called compensation, but it’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk added. “It’s just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army, not current control, but a strong influence? That’s what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don’t feel comfortable wielding that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

Musk conceded that having voting control in the “mid-20s” per cent range would help secure a “strong influence,” but gives shareholders enough control to fire him if he goes “insane.”

Musk’s net worth is about $455 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.

Musk may soon be crowned the inaugural king of the trillionaires club

Tesla’s board announced the ambitious executive pay plan for Musk in September. If approved at the company’s annual meeting on Nov. 6, Musk will be incrementally paid out over 420 million shares of the EV company—that is, only if he can achieve the company’s growth plans, which include the delivery of 20 million Tesla vehicles and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation.

At the time of the announcement, Tesla stock price was down roughly 10% for the year, and the board felt the long-term CEO performance award would “retain and incentivize Elon to focus his energies.”

“While we believe Elon is the only person capable of leading Tesla at this critical inflection point, changing the world is neither an overnight process nor the work of a single person,” Tesla’s Board wrote in a letter to shareholders. “So, we also want your help in securing the team and strategy needed to achieve goals that others will perceive as impossible but that we know are possible for Tesla.”

Since then, Tesla’s stock has rebounded, now up more than 15% year-to-date.

Alternative assets and retirement

This is where alternative assets can step in. Unlike traditional stocks and bonds, alternative assets can be a powerful hedge against inflation — which can erode the value of your money over the long term.

Gold is a traditional safe-haven asset, meaning it’s an investment many flock to during times of market uncertainty. The precious yellow metal has also been on a historic bull run, breaching $4,000 per ounce in September. (4)

Plus, with a gold IRA, you can take advantage of significant tax benefits for your retirement. Thor Metals offers a gold IRA that allows investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold. This combination can make it an attractive option for those looking to hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

To learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases. Just keep in mind that gold is typically just one part of a well-diversified portfolio.

Another inflation-resistant alternative investment you could consider is commercial real estate.

Traditionally, direct access to the $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector was limited to a select group of elite investors, but that’s changed with First National Realty Partners (FNRP). FNRP helps accredited investors diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without needing to take on the responsibilities of being a landlord.

With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to triple net leases, accredited investors can invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.

Simply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.

FNRP also has a self-directed IRA (SDIRA), which allows you to invest for your retirement through tangible, income-producing assets that can offer predictable cash flows and long-term growth. With FNRP, your rental income and investment gains can grow tax-deferred in a SDIRA – maximizing your savings and diminishing your reliance on public markets.

How much should you have saved by age 61?

With $1.5 million saved, Jim and Helen are ahead of many Americans. The median retirement savings for Americans between 55 and 64 was around $185,000, according to the Federal Reserve. (5)

However, financial planners often suggest that by the time you reach your early sixties, you should have between eight and ten times your annual income saved for retirement. For Jim and Helen, that would equate to a nest egg between $2.4 million and $3 million, meaning they’re far below target even if they’re doing well for their cohort.

There is no single “golden number” for retirement savings, because spending habits, health and lifestyle choices vary. That said, $1.5 million can provide a comfortable retirement for some, especially if at least one spouse continues to earn income and delays withdrawals from savings accounts.

The real question is whether Jim and Helen can maintain their current quality of life in retirement.

Estimating retirement income at 61

If both Jim and Helen retire this year, they could begin drawing from their retirement accounts without penalty.

Based on the commonly cited 4% withdrawal rule, a $1.5 million nest egg could give them about $60,000 annually, before taxes. That’s 80% less than the couple’s current level of annual income.

While it seems unlikely they would be able to comfortably live at a substantially lower level of income, there might be ways they can cut costs to live on a somewhat smaller nest egg. They could use Monarch Money’s all-in-one budgeting app to see where they’re over-spending and under-investing, to make the most of their money.

Monarch Money puts all your finances under one roof, from your banking statements to your investments. You can also add separate or joint accounts to your dashboard, which can be great for tracking anything from grocery runs to gas station fill-ups for couples. The app is also well reviewed. Forbes ranked Monarch Money as their best budgeting app for 2025, as did the Wall Street Journal.

And the best part? Monarch Money offers a seven-day free trial so you can see if it’s right for you. If you like what you see, you could then snag 50% off with code WISE50.

The earlier they retire, the more seriously they’ll need to take their budgeting.

For instance, if they claim Social Security at 62, the first year Americans are eligible for benefits, they would receive about 30% less per month than if they wait until full retirement age, at 67. They would earn less than half of what they could get if they delayed retirement until 70.

If Helen were to put off her retirement until 67, her Social Security benefits could significantly boost their income. If she delays claiming benefits until then, she will receive a higher payout for life. Jim could claim his benefit earlier, wait until full retirement age or even 70 to maximize his payout.

By combining withdrawals from their savings, Social Security and Helen's continued earnings for the next six years, they could maintain their current standard of living until both are retired.

But, again, this would depend primarily on Helen’s plans and whether she’s hoping to retire now, alongside her husband.

Actionable steps before retiring

Before deciding to retire, there are a few things that Jim and Helen should consider:

Creating a detailed retirement budget that includes health care, housing, travel and discretionary spending.

Working part-time or as consultants for extra income, so that Jim and/or Helen can reduce their withdrawals from savings in the early years. If Jim finds part-time work, this could give them not only a small financial bump but also a social connection.

Meeting with a financial planner to run simulations based on different retirement ages and market conditions.

One option would be to work with Advisor.com to find a financial advisor that suits their goals. All of Advisor.com’s financial experts are pre-vetted fiduciaries, meaning they have a legal obligation to act in your best interest.

After inputting your ZIP code to find a nearby advisor, you can set up a free call with no obligation to hire, so you can make sure they’re the right fit for your needs.

From here, Jim and Helen could revisit their investment allocation to balance income needs with long-term growth potential.

The bottom line

Retiring at 61 with $1.5 million and no debt is possible, especially with one spouse continuing to work for several more years.

However, if Helen and Jim retire together, they may need to change their lifestyle to adapt to their new annual income.

They should remember that the key to retirement success is understanding how long your money needs to last, and what lifestyle you want to maintain. In Jim and Helen’s case, Helen’s continued income could provide a cushion if she decides to keep working. But her decision should be grounded in careful planning, realistic spending expectations and an awareness of longevity risk — not to mention a conversation with a financial planner.

With the right strategy, Jim and Helen could transition into retirement with both financial security and peace of mind.

Blue Jays, MLSE stake drive Rogers revenue growth amid World Series run Back to video

The leap accounted for the vast majority of growth in total revenue, which increased four per cent to $5.35 billion, despite the media segment comprising the smallest of Rogers’ three main areas. Wireless and cable make up the other two.

“In media, revenue growth was up 26 per cent, driven by a strong Blue Jays regular season and the consolidation of MLSE results,” chief executive Tony Staffieri told analysts on a conference call Thursday.

Article content

Total profits in the third quarter rose by an order of magnitude to $5.75 billion, mainly due to a one-time non-cash gain linked to Rogers’ acquisition of BCE Inc.’s stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The deal made Rogers the majority owner of the country’s largest sports company, whose assets include the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors.

Meanwhile, the Blue Jays’ “very strong regular season performance” garnered higher attendance levels and growing interest from fans countrywide, particularly in September when the team clinched a return to the post-season, said chief financial officer Glenn Brandt.

Article content

Regardless of the outcome of the championship contest that kicks off Friday, Rogers will see higher media revenue this month thanks to its baseball franchise.

“The Blue Jays’ very successful MLB playoffs and World Series run will provide further added growth in the fourth quarter,” Brandt said.

Rogers’ wireless service — its biggest income source — saw revenue dip to $2.06 billion in its latest quarter from $2.07 billion a year earlier.

“In the highly competitive wireless market, we saw some pressure on service revenue and ARPU (average revenue per user),” Staffieri said. Executives also pointed to lower immigration levels as a reason for the slight downturn.

Cable revenue climbed to $1.98 billion from $1.97 billion the year before.

On an adjusted basis, which excluded a $5-billion gain related to the MLSE deal, Rogers said it earned $740 million attributable to shareholders or $1.37 per share in the third quarter, down from $762 million or $1.42 per share a year ago.

XOM,Apollo considers sale of Hispanic grocer Heritage Grocers Group,Energy,"US private equity company Apollo Global Management is exploring the sale of its Hispanic grocery chain, Heritage Grocers Group.

The move comes as concerns over mass deportations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted Heritage’s core Hispanic customers to exercise greater caution over their shopping habits, dampening consumer demand within Latino communities across the US, as reported by Reuters.

Apollo could secure $1.5bn from the potential sale and has engaged investment bank UBS to manage the process.

Heritage Grocers generates $150m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and records more than $2bn in annual revenue.

Apollo and UBS declined to comment on Reuters’ inquiries, while Heritage Grocers also did not respond to requests for comment.

The company operates several Hispanic-focused grocery banners, including El Rancho Supermercado, Cardenas Markets and Tony’s Fresh Market.

Apollo acquired Tony’s from its founding family and Cardenas from private equity firm KKR in 2022, merging the two.

It purchased El Rancho in 2023.

Heritage Grocers currently operates 115 stores across Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Nevada and Texas.

Apollo has made various investments in the grocery sector, including The Fresh Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, Smart & Final and Albertsons.",Retail-insight-network.com,2025-10-23T14:03:53Z,https://www.retail-insight-network.com/news/apollo-sale-heritage-grocers-group/,0.4,2025-10-24 22:27:40.534378,0.9999999999999999,
XOM,"Stocks Rise, Shaking Off Early Jitters After Tesla Earnings",Energy,"Wall Street bought the dip in riskier assets on Thursday ahead of the first trickle of government data since the start of the shutdown.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 144 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 was up 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9%. The major indexes approached their highest closing levels on record before paring some of their gains in the final hour of trading.

The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 3.48% to snap a three-day streak of falling yields. The 10-year yield was up to 3.99%.

The consumer price index for September is due out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report was slated to come out just over a week ago, but the shutdown has suspended most government data releases. Heading into the report, some traders appeared to trim bets on two rate cuts through the end of the year: Odds of a half-point in cuts through December dipped to 91.9% from 95.5% on Wednesday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said earlier this month it would publish the report to allow the Social Security Administration to meet a deadline related to inflation-adjusted benefit payments. It said no other releases will be rescheduled or produced until regular government services resume.

After falling sharply on Wednesday, more speculative parts of the market like quantum computing, crypto, and nuclear were on the rebound.

“What a difference a day makes,” writes Mizuho’s Daniel O’Regan. “We are seeing the exact opposite price action of the last few days with crowded longs, high beta fliers and meme stocks regaining lost momentum.”

O’Regan writes that based on client conversations, he feels like many of the moves are driven by quantitative traders, commodity trading advisors, and rebalancing, rather than active managers. He adds that most clients he talks to are waiting for pullbacks in high-quality stocks as we head into the heart of earnings season.

XOM,"Once a Tesla fan, Trump is now hobbling its profits",Energy,"Synopsis

Elon Musk's initial closeness to President Trump in early 2025 has soured, with Trump's policies now negatively impacting Tesla's profits. The end of EV tax credits, increased tariffs on imported components, and dwindling regulatory credit sales have significantly eroded Tesla's profitability despite record revenues.

When Donald Trump returned to the White House in early 2025, few corporate leaders appeared closer to him than Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO had not only advised Trump but even shared public displays of camaraderie. Investors assumed that Musk’s closeness to the US President would translate into policy advantages for Tesla, the world’s most valuable electric-vehicle company.

In March 2025, Trump turned the South Lawn of the White House into a temporary Tesla showroom in a conspicuous favour to his then adviser Musk. Tesla delivered five of its vehicles to the White House and parked them on a driveway for Trump to personally inspect. As a show of support for Tesla, Trump also bought a Tesla Model S outside the White House in the presence of Musk. Months later, when Musk has distanced himself from Trump after a bitter fallout, Trump's policies are adversely affecting the profits of Tesla

Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings showed record revenues yet sharply lower profits, as the very policies of the Trump administration now weigh on the company’s performance. Instead of benefiting from political friendship, Tesla finds itself caught in a tightening web of tariff costs, shrinking incentives and evaporating regulatory credits.

The end of incentives and the demand squeeze

Live Events

For more than a decade, federal tax credits have been the engine behind America’s electric-vehicle boom. Buyers of new EVs could claim up to $7,500 in credits, keeping Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y among the country’s top-selling cars. That incentive, first passed in 2008 and extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was crucial to maintaining steady consumer demand.

Trump’s tax-cut and spending law, signed in July 2025, abruptly ended that support by setting a September 30 expiration for the credit. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, Tesla enjoyed a rush of orders as consumers raced to secure the subsidy. But that was a one-time surge. With the incentive gone, sales momentum is already softening, and analysts expect electric-vehicle registrations to drop sharply through the end of the year.

Tesla’s third-quarter results tell the story in numbers. Revenue climbed 12 percent to $28.1 billion but profits fell 37 percent to $1.4 billion. The surge in revenue reflected the final burst of subsidised sales, while the profit decline reflected the higher costs of doing business in Trump’s America.

How tariffs and trade wars weigh on Tesla

Although Tesla builds all its U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, its supply chain stretches across continents. The company depends on imported components, including battery minerals and electronic systems sourced from Asia and South America. Trump’s aggressive trade policies, reviving tariffs on auto parts and raw materials, have driven up those costs substantially.

Tesla’s chief financial officer revealed that tariffs added more than $400 million in expenses during the third quarter alone. These import levies hit at every level of Tesla’s production, from nickel and lithium shipments to specialised semiconductors. Even as Tesla accelerates its efforts to localise production, the sudden increase in input costs has eroded margins and dented profitability.

Trump’s trade war has also disrupted global logistics. Tesla’s factories in Germany and China, which supply vehicles and components to various markets, are facing bottlenecks and higher transport costs due to retaliatory tariffs and supply restrictions. The administration’s insistence on reshoring production may appeal politically, but for a company like Tesla with an international manufacturing footprint, it has translated into an expensive logistical puzzle.

Fading regulatory credits

For years, Tesla relied on the sale of environmental and fuel-efficiency credits to other automakers as a lucrative source. Those credits, essentially payments from polluting rivals, often turned unprofitable quarters into profitable ones. But under Trump, the government has relaxed enforcement of fuel-efficiency penalties, allowing legacy automakers to pollute more without paying steep fines. That means fewer companies now need to buy Tesla’s credits and that once-reliable income stream is dwindling fast.

The fall in credit revenue, combined with rising costs and the end of the consumer tax break, has transformed Tesla’s financial profile. What investors once viewed as a politically sheltered company now looks increasingly exposed to Trump's policy swings. The public fallout between Musk and Trump over the summer, after Musk distanced himself from the administration, only intensified the perception that Tesla is now on the wrong side of the White House.

Tesla's future hinges on innovation

Tesla’s experience in 2025 is a sharp reminder that political proximity can be a double-edged sword. The early belief that Musk’s relationship with Trump would bring regulatory advantages has proved misplaced. Instead, the administration’s broader agenda, whcih includes cutting EV incentives, easing fuel-efficiency rules, and waging trade wars, has struck directly at Tesla’s core business model.

Musk, once eager to align himself with the president, now faces the consequences of that gamble. The company’s record revenues mask deepening vulnerabilities such as a fading policy cushion, rising production costs and an uncertain demand outlook. Going forward, investors will expect Tesla's success to stem from company’s ability to innovate, adapt and operate profitably in a far less forgiving atmosphere.

XOM,“You Gotta Love It When Life Comes Full Circle.” A MAJOR Celebrity Announces NEW Deal With Six Flags Theme Parks,Energy,"Some partnerships just make perfect sense. Disney X LEGO? That’s a match made in toy heaven. Benson Boone X Crumbl Cookies? We see the vision. But the latest pop culture partnership — Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs X Six Flags theme parks — is quite the surprise.

On October 21st, the JANA Partners investment firm announced it is partnering with Travis Kelce (who is currently engaged to Taylor Swift, by the way) to “enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience” at Six Flags theme parks.

Kelce released a statement on social media, reading, “To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families! Excited to partner with JANA Partners as an investor in Six Flags. So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.”

As it turns out, Kelce has been a fan of theme parks — specifically Six Flags — for a long time. In a new press release, he stated, “I am a lifelong Six Flags fan and grew up going to these parks with my family and friends,” adding, “The chance to help make Six Flags special for the next generation is one I couldn’t pass up.”

In a New Heights podcast episode, Kelce further detailed his love of theme parks. Kelce was raised in Ohio and grew up going to Cedar Point amusement park. Cedar Point’s parent company is Cedar Fair, which merged with Six Flags in 2024. Kelce’s brother, Jason, explains on the New Heights podcast that “Cedar Point is rollercoaster U.S.A.,” adding, “It is the premier roller coaster amusement park in the country.”

This news comes amid a flurry of headlines about Six Flags theme parks closing around the U.S.

Several Six Flags locations have announced closures, including Six Flags America in Maryland and Six Flags Great America in California (unless they extend their lease). Four other theme parks have been closed by the company in the past:

Six Flags AstroWorld was located in Houston, Texas

Six Flags AutoWorld theme park in Flint, Michigan

Six Flags New Orleans

Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom

Six Flags CEO Richard Zimmerman announced plans to step down by the end of the year following low second-quarter earnings; the company reported a $100 million loss within three months.

Why Six Flags Had To Close 7 Theme Parks

Could this new partnership boost profits for Six Flags? Kelce has not revealed how he plans to work with the company going forward. Kelce and the JANA Partners investment firm collectively own about 9% of the economic interest in the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation.

Well, we didn’t see this news coming! We’ll be curious to see how this new partnership changes things for Six Flags. In the meantime, we’re always on the lookout for the latest theme park news, so stay tuned for more.

(Side note: If you'd actually prefer a robot wrote this newsletter, please don't share that opinion with my bosses.)

Aerie, Heineken, and DC Comics are some of the brands shouting from the rooftops (or massive billboards) about their anti-AI stance, writes BI's Lara O'Reilly and Jordan Hart.

For these companies, it's a bet that promoting human authenticity will resonate with people who are growing tired of AI infiltrating all aspects of life.

Finding that human-AI balance was a key theme at Advertising Week New York, Lara previously reported. And even those on the cutting edge of AI seem to recognize the need to tap into the human element.

Just look at this ad from OpenAI of a guy trying to do pull-ups. How very relatable and human!

Of course, there's no guarantee people are buying it.

""Would you like me to go ahead and do the workout for you?"" reads one of the top comments on YouTube.

The anti-AI companies are toeing a fine line.

While most people have some level of AI fatigue — I'm sick of getting tricked by those fake, AI-generated post-game press conferences — it also seems foolish to disregard the technology altogether.

The benefits of leveraging AI to some degree are undeniable, and dismissing that could be a grave mistake. Some might argue that a purely human approach in a world full of AI is a differentiator, like a restaurant sourcing all its ingredients from a local farm.

But while that business model might work on a small scale, the bigger you are the harder it becomes. That's especially true if your rivals are willing to dive into the AI pool headfirst.

Marketers could also be doing a bit of self-preservation. The more you proclaim the importance of marketing your company as human-first, the more job security you give yourself.

However, one study hints at the inevitability of AI adoption. The survey found 87% of executives use AI on the job, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman. That's compared to just 57% usage among managers and 27% of employees using it.

The split shows how those at the top of orgs are the biggest proponents of the tech. But that doesn't make the adoption any easier, as Sarah covered in the deep divide taking place at video-game giant Electronic Arts.

1. Google is stripping back management layers (again). In a memo sent to staff last month, the search giant said it was eliminating a middle-management layer in its US ads business. The move is part of Google's larger efforts to speed up decisions and cut bureaucracy, and it reflects a wider trend happening across Big Tech.

JNJ,Watch These Tesla Price Levels as Stock Skids After Earnings Miss,Healthcare,"Tesla (TSLA) shares fell Thursday morning after the company's quarterly profit came in short of analysts' estimates, even as it returned to revenue growth following two quarters of declines.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share in the period, missing the average Wall Street estimate of 54 cents a share. Lower EV prices and higher operating costs tied to restructuring and AI investments dented the bottom line. CEO Elon Musk told analysts that Tesla is at a ""critical inflection point"" as it focuses on its next phase of growth, which will center on “real-world” applications of AI, including self-driving cars and smart robots.

Tesla shares were down 5% at around $418 in the opening minutes of Thursday's session. The stock, which was the top performer among Magnificent Seven stocks in the third quarter, was up 9% for the year through Wednesday's close.

Below, we break down the technicals on Tesla’s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for.

Pennant Pattern Breakdown

After hitting their 2025 high earlier this month, Tesla shares have consolidated within a pennant, a chart pattern signaling a continuation of the stock’s recent uptrend.

However, the price looks set to break down below the pattern in Thursday’s trading session following the weaker-than-expected earnings, suggesting waning bullish momentum and the potential for a near-term pullback.

It’s also worth noting that volume has declined during the pennant pattern, indicating a lack of conviction among buyers and sellers ahead of the company’s quarterly results.

Let’s identify three key support levels to watch on Tesla’s chart if the shares lose ground and also point out a zone of resistance worth monitoring during potential upswings in the stock.

Key Support Levels to Watch

The first level to watch sits around $360. This area, roughly midway between the 50- and 200-day moving averages, would likely attract buyers’ attention near a trendline that links a series of peaks on the chart between November and August.

Selling below this level could see the shares retreat toward $292. The price may find support in this location near the March countertrend high and a cluster of trading activity spanning from April to July.

A more-significant retracement may spark a decline to the $267 level. Investors could see this as a high probability buying area near three prominent peaks that formed on the chart in July, September, and October last year.

Zone of Resistance Worth Monitoring

During upswings in Tesla shares, investors should keep a close eye on a zone of resistance between $465 and $489. Those who have purchased at lower prices may seek exit points in this region near the top of the pennant pattern and the stock’s record high.

JNJ,US stocks open flat as poor earnings dampen investor mood,Healthcare,"Synopsis

Wall Street opened flat on Thursday as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM dampened investor mood, while brewing trade tensions between the U.S. and China threatened to deepen the market's unease.

Wall Street was largely muted on Thursday, as lackluster earnings from Tesla and IBM cast a shadow over risk appetite, while investors kept a close eye on simmering U.S.-China trade tensions.

Tesla's third-quarter profit missed expectations, dragging its shares down 5.3%. A revenue beat offered little relief, as Wall Street grappled with tempered optimism through the week.

The electric-vehicle maker kicked off earnings for the ""Magnificent Seven"" — a cohort that forms nearly 35% of S&P 500's weight, and could dictate the market's next move.

IBM dropped 5.4% after the company recorded a slowdown in growth in its key cloud software segment, eclipsing a third-quarter beat.

Amid a whirlwind of earnings reports, profit-taking and escalating trade tensions, the equity rally is showing signs of fatigue.

Live Events

While most companies have outpaced analyst estimates, cautious outlooks have cast a shadow as investors look for justification behind sky-high equity valuations.

""The numbers are not high profile enough and not rampant enough to really drive a market through these big milestones,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group.

""The caution does feed in and big earnings are to come through next week and that might just be the wait and see approach.""

At 09:38 a.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 41.34 points, or 0.10%, to 46,631.75, the S&P 500 gained 11.93 points, or 0.18%, to 6,711.33 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 23.30 points, or 0.09%, to 22,760.43.

Quantum computing firms were a bright spot after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was in talks with several of them to take equity stakes in exchange for federal funding.

IonQ and D-Wave Quantum gained 5.7% and 15.6%, respectively, while Rigetti Computing added 8%.

Energy stocks added 1.2% following a jump in crude prices on fresh U.S. sanctions against Russia. Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Halliburton rose between 1% and 2.1%.

Health insurer Molina Healthcare plunged 20.9% after slashing its annual profit forecast. Peers Centene and UnitedHealth fell 6.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

S&P Industrials index rose 0.8% after a slew of earnings. Honeywell raised its annual profit forecast on strong aerospace demand, sending its shares up 5%.

American Airlines shares gained 3.6% after the carrier raised its profit forecast for the year, while Southwest Airlines slipped 3.7% despite a surprise quarterly profit.

T-Mobile dipped 2.3% despite adding more-than-expected wireless subscribers during the third quarter.

DATA DROUGHT DRAGS ON

With the U.S. government shutdown entering its twenty-third day, key economic releases, including Thursday's usual reading of weekly jobless claims data, remain frozen, leaving investors without crucial signals.

That puts Friday's core CPI print, expected to hold steady at 3.1%, in sharp focus as the Federal Reserve's only clear inflation guide ahead of next week's policy meeting.

Markets have already priced in a 25-basis-point rate cut, with traders betting the Fed will ease again in December.

Meanwhile, a Reuters report said the Trump administration was weighing sweeping curbs on high-tech exports to China in retaliation for Beijing's latest restrictions on rare-earth shipments. The report injected fresh uncertainty into the markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.07-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.66-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 32 new lows.

JNJ,"What’s up with… Nokia, Orange, mobile security",Healthcare,"In today’s industry news roundup: Nokia’s third-quarter financials surprise analysts, with booming demand for AI, cloud and 5G putting the company back on track following its profit warning in July; Orange CEO doubles down on consolidation hopes as she reports overall third-quarter revenue and EBITDal growth and claims 300 million customers worldwide; Verizon’s recent Mobile Security Index finds mobile attacks are on the rise, with the threat made worse by the growing use of AI by employees in the workplace; and much more!

Nokia remains on track to achieve its full-year outlook after reporting third-quarter results that certainly seem to have come as a pleasant surprise to analysts, with AI and cloud business providing a welcome boost.As noted by Reuters, the comparable operating profit in the quarter to the end of September reached €435m, while analysts polled by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) expected this metric to reach €342m. The Finland-based vendor appears to be back on a more even keel following a difficult first six months of the year. Indeed, the vendor hadissued a profit warning in July, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. Its outlook now remains unchanged for 2025 as a whole, although it has revised upwards the operating profit outlook by €0.1bn, to between €1.7bn and €2.2bn. This is owing to a change in venture fund reporting after Nokia decided to scale down its passive venture fund investments. In the third quarter, net sales rose 9% to €4.83bn on a comparable basis, said to be aided by strong growth in optical networks and cloud services. In a statement, Nokia president and CEO Justin Hotard said network infrastructure “delivered 11% net sales growth. Optical networks grew 19%, coming largely from AI and cloud customers”. Nokia noted that AI and cloud customers accounted for 6% of net sales at group level, and 14% of network infrastructure sales. According to the Reuters report, Hotard told journalists that AI and datacentre demand “continues to be robust. In fact, it continues to accelerate from our perspective”. Net sales from cloud and network services increased by 13% as “operator investments in 5G core remain strong”, said Hotard. “Our cloud-native 5G core offering continues to gain traction and we are gaining market share”, he added. Hotard highlighted, in particular,the recent deal with VodafoneThree that marked Nokia’s re-entry as a RAN supplier in the UK market for both Vodafone and Three’s combined network operations following their recent merger. For more details about Nokia’s results, seethis press release.

This week has also seen a smattering ofthird-quarter results from telcos, including Orange, which released its figures on Thursday. During the earnings call, Orange Group CEO Christel Heydemann wasted no time in addressing the France-based operator’s consolidation ambitions following its recent€17bn joint takeover offer for certain activities of Alice France, including SFR. The non-binding offer by Bouygues Telecom, Iliad (Free) and Orange was swiftly rejected by Altice, but the trio has indicated that it intends to continue negotiations to see if an agreement can be reached. According to Heydemann, “this deal would allow us to strengthen investments in France while maintaining a competitive ecosystem for the benefit of consumers”. She also stressed there is “no certainty that we will reach an agreement, and we are willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Altice group”. Turning to Orange’s financial performance, Heydemann painted a broadly positive picture for the third quarter, noting that both revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation after lease (EBITDAaL) expenses increased in the three months to 30 September 2025. In fact, EBITDAaL rose by a reasonably healthy 3.7% on a comparable basis to €3.44bn, prompting Orange to increase its annual guidance to at least 3.5%. Revenue rose by a somewhat lower rate of 0.8% to €9.99bn. Heydemann also pointed out that Orange has now passed the “symbolic threshold of 300 million customers worldwide”. In terms of group segments, Africa and the Middle East remained a growth driver, as has now been the case for several quarters. This region saw revenue rise by 12.2% owing to a 13.1% increase in retail revenues, marking 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Orange’s domestic market, France, saw revenue fall by 3.7% on a comparable basis to €4.34bn, blamed in part on the “anticipated decline” in wholesale. At the same time, Orange said mobile net additions in France have reached their highest level since 2022. Excluding France, the Europe segment saw a return to revenue growth with an increase of 4.7%, largely owing to retail services growth. Orange Business, however, remains a work in progress, reporting a 4.3% decline in revenue. The operator described the IT services market as “challenging”, whereas Orange Cyberdefense continued to shine, with a 6.3% revenue increase in the first nine months of the year. For more details about Orange’s results, see this press release.

The various flavours of AI may be good for business, as highlighted by Nokia above, but it also brings a growing level of risk for mobile devices, according to a new report from Verizon Business. TheVerizon 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) reveals that mobile devices are “under attack, now more than ever, with 85% of organisations reporting increasing mobile attacks”. Although 75% of organisations are said to have upped their mobile security spending over the past year, the increase in the number of employees using generative AI services for work purposes “is quickly expanding the attack surface”, the report warns. It notes that 34% of organisations “fear that more sophisticated and large-scale AI-powered attacks will significantly increase their risk, and 38% believe ransomware will become even more dangerous when powered by AI”. Chris Novak, VP of global cybersecurity solutions at Verizon Business, declared that this year’s Mobile Security Index “is a clear wake-up call: Mobile security is no longer a perimeter defence but a battle fought in the palm of every employee’s hand. We talk about the perfect storm: With the rise of AI, we’re witnessing a Category 5 hurricane in mobile security, where AI is the wind – and human error is the open window”. For more details about the report’s findings, seethis press release. The report can also be found using this link.

Alternative pan-European long-distance network operatorEXA Infrastructure is maintaining its recent busy streak. On Thursday, it announced it has signed an agreement to purchase all long-haul duct assets belonging to Conexio doo Beograd, a provider of dark fibre and colocation services across Serbia. No financial details of the transaction were provided, however. The operator noted that the transaction further strengthens its “strategic footprint in the Balkans”, and builds on its previous acquisitions of Unitel in Croatia and GCN in Bulgaria. Under the agreement, EXA Infrastructure will buy two high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ducts spanning 860km, existing cables, and 15 points of presence (PoP) locations. The transaction also includes the transfer of existing customer contracts. EXA’s latest move comes hot on the heels of a “major” but unspecified investment in the diversity and capacity of its network between Marseille and Paris. The company also recentlyissued a press release to announce it had “refinanced its existing facilities and raised new financing… to support continued growth ambitions and network expansion plans”. It noted that the combined value of the refinanced debt and new investment is €1.3bn, but didn’t provide many details.",TelecomTV,2025-10-23T14:18:40Z,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/5g/what-s-up-with-nokia-orange-mobile-security-54148/,0.6,2025-10-24 22:27:43.589302,0.9999999999999999,
JNJ,European markets rise after major earnings reports; Gucci-owner Kering surges 9%,Healthcare,"Brendan McDermid | Reuters

LONDON — European stocks ended Thursday in positive territory as investors looked to earnings reports for clues on business activity and confidence in the region.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the session up 0.4%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index added 0.7%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.2%, and Italy's FTSE MIB also saw gains of 0.4%. Germany's DAX also edged higher, ending up 0.3%.

It was a busy day for earnings in Europe with Kering , Roche Holding , Unilever , Vinci , Thales , LSEG , Dassault Systemes , Antofagasta , Swedbank, Nokia and Lloyds Banking Group among the big names reporting third-quarter figures.

Enterprise software firm SAP released earnings late on Wednesday, which missed analyst expectations. The German company reported a 7% increase in revenue for the third quarter of 9.08 billion euros ($10.53 billion), below expectations of 9.15 billion euros ($7.96 billion), according to consensus figures compiled by LSEG.

However, it saw gains of 22% in its cloud revenue, with CEO Christian Klein putting it down to increasing AI and data cloud market share.

""For Q4 we are executing against a strong pipeline - which gives us confidence in our accelerating total revenue growth ambition for 2026,"" he said in a statement. SAP's shares ended the session up 2.2%.

Gucci-owner Kering also reported after the bell on Wednesday. The group's revenue totaled 3.4 billion euros in the quarter, down 5% on a comparable basis but it beat expectations of 3.31 billion euros, per a consensus compiled by FactSet. Gucci sales — which typically make up close to half of Kering's total revenues — came in just shy of forecasts at 1.3 billion euros, down 14% on a comparable basis on the year before. Its shares closed 8.7% higher.

In financial services, Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday reported pre-tax profit of almost £1.2 billion, slightly higher than consensus estimates of about £1 billion, but down from the £1.8 billion of the same period last year. It comes after the British lender announced earlier this month an additional £800 million charge relating to customer compensation arising from the U.K. car finance misselling scandal. Its shares were up 1.2% at the closing bell.

Shares in Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) lost 0.1% as its net interest income reached 10.4 billion Swedish krona during the third quarter, beating the 10.2 Swedish krona predicted by analysts. The bank's quarterly-earnings report showed net profits of 7.68 billion Swedish krona for the three-month period, missing the 7.86 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts, according to LSEG estimates.

Swedbank reported pre-tax profits of 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above the 9.4 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts. Shares in the Stockholm-listed lender — which has a strong presence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — fell 0.2% on the day. The bank saw net interest income reach 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above analyst estimates of 10.7 billion Swedish krona.

Attention turns to energy

Oil prices were in focus Thursday after they jumped around 3% in the previous session when the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The commodity was up by more than 5% in afternoon trade.

The administration cited Moscow's ""lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.""

European Union member states also approved new sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, to be formally adopted today, including a ban on liquefied natural gas imports further as the bloc ramps up efforts to decouple its energy supply from Russian oil and gas.

""We really want to deprive Russia of the means to fund this war to end this war,"" Kaja Kallas, European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and vice president of the European Commission, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

The continent has made progress on this, Kallas noted, but ""not all the member states are there,"" she said. ""So the criticism that we have heard, also from the United States, regarding some of our member states still buying oil and gas, it's very relevant,"" she added.

Kallas spoke ahead of an EU leaders' summit on Thursday, where further measures will be discussed. Brussels will also discuss using frozen Russian assets as a reparations loan to support Ukraine.

Broader Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell, tracking Wall Street's declines on Wednesday on concerns about U.S.-China trade relations. Trade fears resurfaced after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering curbs on exports to China that are made with U.S. software, citing a U.S. official and three people briefed by U.S. authorities.

U.S. stock markets were in positive territory as investors digested quarterly earnings releases that came out after the previous market close, including from Tesla, IBM, Moderna and Lam Research.

JNJ,Should You Hold Booking Holdings (BKNG)?,Healthcare,"Wedgewood Partners, an investment management company, released its third-quarter 2025 investor letter. The letter is available for download here. AI stocks remain the favorite topic of Wall Street in the third quarter. In the third quarter, Wedgewood Composite’s net return was 5.9% compared to the Standard & Poor’s 8.1%, the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 10.5%, and the Russell 1000 Value Index’s 5.3% return for the same period. In addition, you can check the fund’s best 5 holdings to know its best picks in 2025.

In its third-quarter 2025 investor letter, Wedgewood Partners highlighted stocks such as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG). Headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) provides online travel and restaurant booking services. The one-month return of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was -5.34%, and its shares gained 21.27% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 22, 2025, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock closed at $5,230.59 per share, with a market capitalization of $169.523 billion.

Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its third quarter 2025 investor letter:

""Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) also detracted from performance during the quarter. Revenues grew +16% and earnings per share were up +32% on strong room night growth in its ex-U.S. markets. The Company derives over +60% of its bookings from travelers who go directly to the booking.com app or website. This has freed up advertising cash low to reinvest in distribution across search engines, social media, and now agentic commerce through OpenAI's ""Operator."" Booking's focus on fragmented hotel suppliers in ex-U.S. markets is quite differentiated, so much so that it has allowed it to amass scale in areas that competitors simply have trouble reaching. The Company's obsessive focus on generating attractive returns from advertising has also been a key driver of its success, and that should continue to be beneficial to shareholders, regardless of the marketing channel consumers choose.""",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-23T13:46:29Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hold-booking-holdings-bkng-134629426.html,0.6,2025-10-24 22:27:45.561007,0.9999999999999999,
JNJ,Musk Hijacks Tesla Earnings Call to Vouch for $1 Trillion Pay Plan,Healthcare,"Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, spent the end of Tesla Inc.’s earnings call pleading with investors to approve his $1 trillion pay package and blasting the shareholder advisory firms that have come out against the proposal.

“There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane,” Musk said, interrupting his chief financial officer as the more than hour-long call wrapped up.

It was classic Musk: a fiery end to what had otherwise been a ho-hum call largely devoted to Tesla’s artificial intelligence, humanoid robot and self-driving initiatives. Shareholders will vote on the pay package at Tesla’s Nov. 6 annual meeting in Austin.

Tesla’s earnings report was largely disappointing, with profit missing estimates despite record vehicle deliveries. Operating income plunged 40% in the third quarter, reflecting ongoing strains on an electric-vehicle business that’s being buffeted by changing US policies.

Costs are rising sharply for Tesla, with tariffs taking a more than $400 million toll on last quarter’s results. Operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the period.

Tesla shares dropped as much as 5.7% shortly after the start of regular trading Thursday. The stock is up almost 9% for the year, trailing the 14% advance by the S&P 500 Index.

‘Unmitigated Concerns’

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the unprecedented payout to Musk, the value of which is dependent on Tesla reaching market value thresholds and operational milestones. ISS cited “unmitigated concerns” with the magnitude and design of the award, while Glass Lewis took issue with its potential to dilute other shareholders’ ownership.

JNJ,How To Earn $500 A Month From Ford Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings,Healthcare,"Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Oct. 23.

In the meantime, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. The carmaker currently offers an annual dividend yield of 4.83%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 15 cents per share (60 cents a year).

So, how can investors capitalize on its dividend yield to earn a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $124,300 or around 10,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $24,860 or around 2,000 shares.

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.60 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.60 = 10,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.60 = 2,000 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.

For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.

Ford Price Action

Shares of Ford fell 1% to close at $12.43 on Wednesday.

Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at 36 cents per share. That’s down from 49 cents per share in the year-ago period.

The consensus estimate for Ford's quarterly revenue is $43.86 billion, compared to $43.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters. It also exceeded estimates in seven of the last 10 quarters overall.

Oct 23 - IBM (NYSE:IBM) stock dipped about 6% in early Thursday trading after the company's third-quarter results, released late Wednesday, showed slower software growth despite beating overall estimates.

The tech giant reported adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share, surpassing analyst expectations of $2.45, while revenue climbed to $16.33 billion, above the $16.09 billion consensus.

Net income rose to $1.74 billion, reversing a loss from a year earlier. IBM also raised its full-year revenue growth target to more than 5% and lifted free cash flow guidance to $14 billion.

Still, investors appeared concerned about the pace of software expansion. Software sales grew 10% year over year to $7.2 billion, matching forecasts but falling short of more bullish hopes. The Red Hat unit, a key driver of IBM's AI and hybrid-cloud strategy, showed signs of slowing momentum, which analysts said could weigh on sentiment.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said Red Hat's deceleration may unsettle investors, while Jefferies' Brent Thill noted that IBM's software recovery now depends heavily on reigniting Red Hat growth.

JNJ,Elon Musk Begged For His $1 Trillion Pay Package During Tesla's Q3 Earnings Call,Healthcare,"With a net worth of over $487 billion, Elon Musk is already the richest guy in the world, but that immense wealth didn't stop him from panhandling during Tesla's third-quarter earnings meeting for the approval of his proposed $1 trillion pay package. He also took the time to blast the shareholders and advisory firms that have come out against the proposal.

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended that investors reject the massive payout to Musk. The value of the package is dependent on the automaker reaching a litany of market value goals and operational thresholds — most of which aren't really achievable. From Bloomberg:

""There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not not so much that I can't be fired if I go insane,"" Musk said, interrupting his chief financial officer as the more than hour-long call wrapped up.

It was classic Musk: a fiery end to what had otherwise been a ho-hum earnings call largely devoted to Tesla's artificial intelligence, humanoid robot and self-driving initiatives. Shareholders will vote on the pay package at Tesla's Nov. 6 annual meeting in Austin.

[...]

Musk emphasized, as he has in the past, that sufficient voting control matters more to him than monetary compensation from Tesla.

""I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here, and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,"" he said.

After Musk's little rant concluded, CFO Vaibhav Taneja resumed his closing remarks by praising the ""amazing job"" the special board committee did in constructing the pay package. He made it clear that nothing would get approved until shareholders ""made substantial returns,"" but he did kowtow to Musk by urging said shareholders two more times to vote in favor of the plan.

As we've previously reported, if the package is approved, Musk could still be in line for billions even if his misses nearly all of the goals laid out for him. It's a pretty sweet deal. I'd also be on my hands and knees begging for it.

Tesla had a very weird third quarter. Its net income fell 37% in the three months leading up to September 30 to $1.39 billion. However, revenue rose sharply as buyers in the U.S. flocked to dealers, looking to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 EV tax credit that Musk's old friend, President Donald Trump, personally killed.

The Austin, Texas-based automaker delivered a record 497,099 vehicles in Q3, raising Tesla's revenue 12% to $28.1 billion. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2 billion, and energy revenue rose 44% to $3.42 billion. Services and other revenues also rose $25% to $3.48 billion, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Tesla. From Automotive News:

Tesla said its total gross margin fell to 18 percent from 19.8 percent in the same quarter last year.

[...]

""While we face near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy, we are focused on long-term growth and value creation,"" Tesla said in its third-quarter earnings report.

Analysts had expected Tesla to report revenue of $26.2 billion in the July-September quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG cited by Reuters.

Musk didn't just use the forum to beg for money. He also talked about the lofty (and fairly unattainable) autonomy goals he has set for the company.

CEO Elon Musk on the Oct. 22 earnings call said that vehicle production will expand once Tesla can offer customers a fully autonomous option that no longer requires the driver to pay attention to the road. That will happen shortly with its still-incomplete Full Self-Driving software, he said.

""Really what it comes down to is: can you text while in the car? And if you tell someone yes, that the car is now so good you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you're in the car, anyone who can buy the car, will buy the car,"" Musk said.

[...]

Musk said on the call that demand next year will also be bolstered by the launch of its dedicated CyberCab robotaxi, which won't have human controls. The CyberCab will be used in Tesla's ride-hailing fleet and go on sale to customers, Musk has said.

[...]

""We are expecting to have no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year,"" Musk said on the call. ""And then we do expect to be operating robotaxis in I think about eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year.""

Musk said in July that he expected fully autonomous Tesla robotaxis to serve half the U.S. population by the end of this year.

Musk says the robotaxi rollout is going to be dependent on regulatory approval. Yeah, bud. I'd certainly hope so.

He also talked about the Optimus robot, but it's such a pie-in-the-sky idea, I'm not going to waste your time going over it.

Tesla's deliveries for 2025 are expected to slip to about 1.6 million vehicles — down about 200,000 from 2024.

Volvo's cost-cutting measures seemed to have worked and then some. The automaker just smashed third-quarter profit forecasts despite tariff concerns and tough competition. Its new management — led by CEO Hakan Samuelsson, who returned earlier this year — has spent the past six months slashing costs at the company to counteract stumbling profits. From Reuters:

The company cut 3,000 jobs, pulled guidance and slowed investments to offset pressure from U.S. tariffs, fierce competition and an EV market slowdown.

""What we're now seeing is really, wow okay, this is delivering faster than we thought and faster than we planned,"" Samuelsson said of the cost reductions.

Volvo Cars, based in Sweden but majority-owned by China's Geely Holding, said it made an operating profit before one-off costs of 5.9 billion Swedish crowns ($627 million) in July-September, soaring above analysts' consensus forecast of 1.6 billion crowns, according to Bernstein.

This was despite a 7% drop in sales, with fully electric cars still accounting for less than a quarter of the total.

All in all, Volvo's gross margin rose 24.4% from the second quarter's 17.7% Samulsson said a facelift of the XC60 (which will soon be built in the U.S.) was a big reason for that, along with savings from cooperation with Geely's supply chain as well as the cost-cutting measures they put in place.

Not everybody is having as good a day as Volvo, though. Production at Volkswagen's main plant in Germany will proceed as planned next week, but after that, who the hell knows what'll happen? The issue stems from the risk of a microchip shortage due to a standoff between China and the Netherlands, having to do with chip supplier Nexperia. From Reuters:

The company has no current plans to launch a state-backed reduced working hours scheme at its main Wolfsburg plant near its headquarters due to the risk of microchip shortages, the person also said.

The company is, however, in precautionary discussions with the German labour agency over drawing on the option later, the source added.

As we reported yesterday, other automakers around the globe have urged the two sides to come to a quick resolution on the matter. I'm sure you remember what happened the last time there was an industry-wide microchip shortage. There were thousands of cars that were either not shipped from factories or shipped without key functions. It wasn't a good situation, and I'm sure everybody would like to avoid that scenario again

After noting it launched a ""ride-hailing service in the Bay Area using Robotaxi technology,"" CEO Elon Musk gave investors a few updates on Robotaxis.

“We are expecting to have no safety drivers in large parts of Austin by the end of this year … We are being very cautious about the deployment,"" Musk said on the earnings conference call following the report. Musk added that Tesla aims to launch Robotaxi tests in eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year, including in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona.

Tesla stock was down over 5% in early trade on Thursday.

""The company is hyper-aware of media sensitivity and potential regulatory backlash if anything goes wrong, so it is proceeding with extreme caution,"" Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer said in a note following the call. ""The Tesla story, and valuation multiple, rely on seamless execution rolling out revolutionary technology.""

""Real-world A.I. remains Tesla's ace in the hole, with the potential to unlock incalculably large markets (in Elon's words, the ""infinite money glitch""),"" Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note to investors.

Tesla launched its first Robotaxi test in Austin, Texas, over the summer and expanded its service area a few weeks later; however, a safety driver still remains in each Robotaxi.

Tesla has been testing a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, but the cars are driven by people. The tests and comments coming from Tesla have alarmed local officials in California.

For the quarter, Tesla reported Q3 revenue of $28.01 billion, compared to $26.27 billion expected, per Bloomberg, a 12% jump from the $25.18 billion reported a year ago. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50, compared to $0.54 estimated earnings, translating to EBITDA of $4.23 billion, versus expectations of $3.78 billion. Operating profit fell 40% from a year ago to $1.624 billion.

Tesla also said that lower regulatory emissions credit revenue weighed on its profitability.

Tesla’s Q3 earnings report comes as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) are within striking distance of new highs. The broader market has shaken off President Trump’s unpredictable tariff war, though fears of an economic slowdown in the US persist. Plus, auto sector tariffs of 25% on imported cars and parts are still in place, hurting domestic automakers.

Tesla noted on the conference call that its tariff hit in Q3 rose to $400 million; the company posted a $300 million tariff hit in Q2.

""Both deliveries and free cash flow were all-time records, but admittedly, this backdrop didn't translate into as much upside as we had expected. Headwinds included tariffs, mix, restructuring, and a higher tax rate,"" Piper Sandler's Potter added.

Earlier this month, Tesla said Q3 deliveries came in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company. The company also deployed a record 12.5 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products.

However, the sales surge came before the expiry of the US federal EV tax credit on Sept. 30, the last day of the quarter. Even Tesla believes the company could be in for a tough time after expiration.

One of the moves Tesla made earlier in October to address affordability was the introduction of a stripped-down “standard” version of its Model Y and Model 3 sedans. Both models feature rear-wheel drive, smaller batteries, less powerful motors, and the deletion of some creature comforts. The two cars cost $39,990 and $36,990, respectively.

Musk also made an unusual plea at the end of the earnings call, urging shareholders to approve his package claiming he wouldn't be comfortable building ""a robot army"" without over 20% voting control.

Musk’s current pay package is embroiled in a lawsuit in Delaware, where shareholders alleged they didn’t have enough information to properly vet the compensation awarded by the board, and a trial judge agreed. The Delaware Supreme Court is currently weighing the merits of Tesla’s appeal.

Musk’s newer package faces criticism as well. Independent proxy advisers Glass Lewis and ISS have both recommended that shareholders reject Musk’s latest proposed pay package.

Tesla and IBM were down over 5% after announcing their earnings. Tesla’s profit plunged as rising costs undercut a record quarter of vehicle sales, exposing strains on its operations. Adjusted earnings were 50 cents a share in the period, down 31% from a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Tesla’s operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, and it now estimates the impact of US tariffs was $400 million in the period.

This comes after wall street closed in the negative on Wednesday with Dow Jones down 0.7% and S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite seeing a decline of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively.

JNJ,Rivian Announces Second Round of Layoffs in a Month as EV Industry Woes Deepen,Healthcare,"Electric truck maker Rivian is conducting another round of layoffs, cutting over 600 jobs, which amounts to four percent of its headcount, as the company tries to reduce costs amidst a pullback in the EV industry. This is the EV company’s second round of layoffs in a month.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Rivian, the electric vehicle manufacturer known for its pickup trucks and SUVs, is laying off more than 600 employees, representing around four percent of its total workforce, according to people familiar with the matter. The company had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year. This marks the second round of job cuts in a month, following a smaller layoff affecting 1.5 percent of its staff, which Rivian said was aimed at reducing costs ahead of launching a more affordable SUV in 2026.

The electric vehicle industry is facing significant challenges due to the rollback of policies that supported EV adoption. The expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers is expected to significantly impact sales. Furthermore, these policy changes have disrupted the market for compliance credits, which have been a crucial source of profitability for Rivian and other EV manufacturers. Rivian has estimated that the changes could result in approximately $100 million in revenue being delayed.

Despite a 32 percent increase in vehicle sales to 13,201 units in the third quarter, Rivian has lowered its full-year delivery guidance to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles, down from its previous forecast of up to 46,000 deliveries. The company is set to report its full quarterly earnings on November 4.

As a publicly-traded company since 2021, Rivian has been under pressure to reduce expenses while preparing for the launch of its next model, the R2 SUV. The R2 is expected to have a starting price of around $45,000, making it more affordable than the company’s current R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which start at $70,990 and $76,900, respectively. Rivian anticipates higher demand for the R2 compared to its current models.

Despite losing $1.1 billion in the second quarter, Rivian has stated that it has sufficient funds to launch the R2. However, the company recognizes the need to streamline its operations and reduce costs to navigate the challenging market conditions and ensure long-term success in the competitive electric vehicle industry.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe taunted proponents of gas-powered cars in 2023, when the Democrat plan to force EVs on Americans was in full swing:

Rivian CEO, RJ Scaringe, recently compared the purchase of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to “building a horse barn in 1910.”

Rivian exceeded market expectations by delivering 12,640 EVs in the second quarter of this year. The company is on track to meet its annual production guidance of 50,000 vehicles. “The performance and drivability of an EV makes it so much more desirable than an alternative,” Scaringe said. He added, “Buying a non-EV just feels very old,” adding that while the environmental responsibility is a factor, he also feels that regular ICE cars are boring.

JNJ,Elon Musk defends $1 trillion pay package: ‘I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted’,Healthcare,"“I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,” Musk said Wednesday on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call, referring to the proxy advisory services who are urging investors to reject the pay plan.

The proposal would award Musk up to $1 trillion in stock if he meets key performance targets, including growing the company to an $8.5 trillion market cap, more than a 500% increase from today’s valuation. Musk insisted the package isn’t about personal gain—but rather about ensuring he retains enough influence to steer Tesla’s next chapter, focused on AI, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. If approved, Musk’s stake could rise from 13% to nearly 29%.

“It’s called compensation, but it’s not like I’m going to go spend the money,” Musk added. “It’s just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army, not current control, but a strong influence? That’s what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don’t feel comfortable wielding that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.”

Musk conceded that having voting control in the “mid-20s” per cent range would help secure a “strong influence,” but gives shareholders enough control to fire him if he goes “insane.”

Musk’s net worth is about $455 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.

Musk may soon be crowned the inaugural king of the trillionaires club

Tesla’s board announced the ambitious executive pay plan for Musk in September. If approved at the company’s annual meeting on Nov. 6, Musk will be incrementally paid out over 420 million shares of the EV company—that is, only if he can achieve the company’s growth plans, which include the delivery of 20 million Tesla vehicles and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation.

At the time of the announcement, Tesla stock price was down roughly 10% for the year, and the board felt the long-term CEO performance award would “retain and incentivize Elon to focus his energies.”

“While we believe Elon is the only person capable of leading Tesla at this critical inflection point, changing the world is neither an overnight process nor the work of a single person,” Tesla’s Board wrote in a letter to shareholders. “So, we also want your help in securing the team and strategy needed to achieve goals that others will perceive as impossible but that we know are possible for Tesla.”

Since then, Tesla’s stock has rebounded, now up more than 15% year-to-date.

Alternative assets and retirement

This is where alternative assets can step in. Unlike traditional stocks and bonds, alternative assets can be a powerful hedge against inflation — which can erode the value of your money over the long term.

Gold is a traditional safe-haven asset, meaning it’s an investment many flock to during times of market uncertainty. The precious yellow metal has also been on a historic bull run, breaching $4,000 per ounce in September. (4)

Plus, with a gold IRA, you can take advantage of significant tax benefits for your retirement. Thor Metals offers a gold IRA that allows investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold. This combination can make it an attractive option for those looking to hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

To learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases. Just keep in mind that gold is typically just one part of a well-diversified portfolio.

Another inflation-resistant alternative investment you could consider is commercial real estate.

Traditionally, direct access to the $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector was limited to a select group of elite investors, but that’s changed with First National Realty Partners (FNRP). FNRP helps accredited investors diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without needing to take on the responsibilities of being a landlord.

With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to triple net leases, accredited investors can invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.

Simply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.

FNRP also has a self-directed IRA (SDIRA), which allows you to invest for your retirement through tangible, income-producing assets that can offer predictable cash flows and long-term growth. With FNRP, your rental income and investment gains can grow tax-deferred in a SDIRA – maximizing your savings and diminishing your reliance on public markets.

How much should you have saved by age 61?

With $1.5 million saved, Jim and Helen are ahead of many Americans. The median retirement savings for Americans between 55 and 64 was around $185,000, according to the Federal Reserve. (5)

However, financial planners often suggest that by the time you reach your early sixties, you should have between eight and ten times your annual income saved for retirement. For Jim and Helen, that would equate to a nest egg between $2.4 million and $3 million, meaning they’re far below target even if they’re doing well for their cohort.

There is no single “golden number” for retirement savings, because spending habits, health and lifestyle choices vary. That said, $1.5 million can provide a comfortable retirement for some, especially if at least one spouse continues to earn income and delays withdrawals from savings accounts.

The real question is whether Jim and Helen can maintain their current quality of life in retirement.

Estimating retirement income at 61

If both Jim and Helen retire this year, they could begin drawing from their retirement accounts without penalty.

Based on the commonly cited 4% withdrawal rule, a $1.5 million nest egg could give them about $60,000 annually, before taxes. That’s 80% less than the couple’s current level of annual income.

While it seems unlikely they would be able to comfortably live at a substantially lower level of income, there might be ways they can cut costs to live on a somewhat smaller nest egg. They could use Monarch Money’s all-in-one budgeting app to see where they’re over-spending and under-investing, to make the most of their money.

Monarch Money puts all your finances under one roof, from your banking statements to your investments. You can also add separate or joint accounts to your dashboard, which can be great for tracking anything from grocery runs to gas station fill-ups for couples. The app is also well reviewed. Forbes ranked Monarch Money as their best budgeting app for 2025, as did the Wall Street Journal.

And the best part? Monarch Money offers a seven-day free trial so you can see if it’s right for you. If you like what you see, you could then snag 50% off with code WISE50.

The earlier they retire, the more seriously they’ll need to take their budgeting.

For instance, if they claim Social Security at 62, the first year Americans are eligible for benefits, they would receive about 30% less per month than if they wait until full retirement age, at 67. They would earn less than half of what they could get if they delayed retirement until 70.

If Helen were to put off her retirement until 67, her Social Security benefits could significantly boost their income. If she delays claiming benefits until then, she will receive a higher payout for life. Jim could claim his benefit earlier, wait until full retirement age or even 70 to maximize his payout.

By combining withdrawals from their savings, Social Security and Helen's continued earnings for the next six years, they could maintain their current standard of living until both are retired.

But, again, this would depend primarily on Helen’s plans and whether she’s hoping to retire now, alongside her husband.

Actionable steps before retiring

Before deciding to retire, there are a few things that Jim and Helen should consider:

Creating a detailed retirement budget that includes health care, housing, travel and discretionary spending.

Working part-time or as consultants for extra income, so that Jim and/or Helen can reduce their withdrawals from savings in the early years. If Jim finds part-time work, this could give them not only a small financial bump but also a social connection.

Meeting with a financial planner to run simulations based on different retirement ages and market conditions.

One option would be to work with Advisor.com to find a financial advisor that suits their goals. All of Advisor.com’s financial experts are pre-vetted fiduciaries, meaning they have a legal obligation to act in your best interest.

After inputting your ZIP code to find a nearby advisor, you can set up a free call with no obligation to hire, so you can make sure they’re the right fit for your needs.

From here, Jim and Helen could revisit their investment allocation to balance income needs with long-term growth potential.

The bottom line

Retiring at 61 with $1.5 million and no debt is possible, especially with one spouse continuing to work for several more years.

However, if Helen and Jim retire together, they may need to change their lifestyle to adapt to their new annual income.

They should remember that the key to retirement success is understanding how long your money needs to last, and what lifestyle you want to maintain. In Jim and Helen’s case, Helen’s continued income could provide a cushion if she decides to keep working. But her decision should be grounded in careful planning, realistic spending expectations and an awareness of longevity risk — not to mention a conversation with a financial planner.

With the right strategy, Jim and Helen could transition into retirement with both financial security and peace of mind.

Blue Jays, MLSE stake drive Rogers revenue growth amid World Series run Back to video

The leap accounted for the vast majority of growth in total revenue, which increased four per cent to $5.35 billion, despite the media segment comprising the smallest of Rogers’ three main areas. Wireless and cable make up the other two.

“In media, revenue growth was up 26 per cent, driven by a strong Blue Jays regular season and the consolidation of MLSE results,” chief executive Tony Staffieri told analysts on a conference call Thursday.

Article content

Total profits in the third quarter rose by an order of magnitude to $5.75 billion, mainly due to a one-time non-cash gain linked to Rogers’ acquisition of BCE Inc.’s stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The deal made Rogers the majority owner of the country’s largest sports company, whose assets include the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors.

Meanwhile, the Blue Jays’ “very strong regular season performance” garnered higher attendance levels and growing interest from fans countrywide, particularly in September when the team clinched a return to the post-season, said chief financial officer Glenn Brandt.

Regardless of the outcome of the championship contest that kicks off Friday, Rogers will see higher media revenue this month thanks to its baseball franchise.

On an adjusted basis, which excluded a $5-billion gain related to the MLSE deal, Rogers said it earned $740 million attributable to shareholders or $1.37 per share in the third quarter, down from $762 million or $1.42 per share a year ago.

JNJ,Apollo considers sale of Hispanic grocer Heritage Grocers Group,Healthcare,"US private equity company Apollo Global Management is exploring the sale of its Hispanic grocery chain, Heritage Grocers Group.

The move comes as concerns over mass deportations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted Heritage’s core Hispanic customers to exercise greater caution over their shopping habits, dampening consumer demand within Latino communities across the US, as reported by Reuters.

Apollo could secure $1.5bn from the potential sale and has engaged investment bank UBS to manage the process.

Heritage Grocers generates $150m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and records more than $2bn in annual revenue.

Apollo and UBS declined to comment on Reuters’ inquiries, while Heritage Grocers also did not respond to requests for comment.

The company operates several Hispanic-focused grocery banners, including El Rancho Supermercado, Cardenas Markets and Tony’s Fresh Market.

Apollo acquired Tony’s from its founding family and Cardenas from private equity firm KKR in 2022, merging the two.

It purchased El Rancho in 2023.

JNJ,"Stocks Rise, Shaking Off Early Jitters After Tesla Earnings",Healthcare,"Wall Street bought the dip in riskier assets on Thursday ahead of the first trickle of government data since the start of the shutdown.

The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 3.48% to snap a three-day streak of falling yields. The 10-year yield was up to 3.99%.

The consumer price index for September is due out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report was slated to come out just over a week ago, but the shutdown has suspended most government data releases.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said earlier this month it would publish the report to allow the Social Security Administration to meet a deadline related to inflation-adjusted benefit payments. It said no other releases will be rescheduled or produced until regular government services resume.

After falling sharply on Wednesday, more speculative parts of the market like quantum computing, crypto, and nuclear were on the rebound.

JNJ,"Once a Tesla fan, Trump is now hobbling its profits",Healthcare,"Synopsis

Elon Musk's initial closeness to President Trump in early 2025 has soured, with Trump's policies now negatively impacting Tesla's profits. The end of EV tax credits, increased tariffs on imported components, and dwindling regulatory credit sales have significantly eroded Tesla's profitability despite record revenues.

When Donald Trump returned to the White House in early 2025, few corporate leaders appeared closer to him than Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO had not only advised Trump but even shared public displays of camaraderie. Investors assumed that Musk’s closeness to the US President would translate into policy advantages for Tesla, the world’s most valuable electric-vehicle company.

In March 2025, Trump turned the South Lawn of the White House into a temporary Tesla showroom in a conspicuous favour to his then adviser Musk. Tesla delivered five of its vehicles to the White House and parked them on a driveway for Trump to personally inspect. As a show of support for Tesla, Trump also bought a Tesla Model S outside the White House in the presence of Musk. Months later, when Musk has distanced himself from Trump after a bitter fallout, Trump's policies are adversely affecting the profits of Tesla

Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings showed record revenues yet sharply lower profits, as the very policies of the Trump administration now weigh on the company’s performance. Instead of benefiting from political friendship, Tesla finds itself caught in a tightening web of tariff costs, shrinking incentives and evaporating regulatory credits.

The end of incentives and the demand squeeze

Live Events

For more than a decade, federal tax credits have been the engine behind America’s electric-vehicle boom. Buyers of new EVs could claim up to $7,500 in credits, keeping Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y among the country’s top-selling cars. That incentive, first passed in 2008 and extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was crucial to maintaining steady consumer demand.

Trump’s tax-cut and spending law, signed in July 2025, abruptly ended that support by setting a September 30 expiration for the credit. In the weeks leading up to the deadline, Tesla enjoyed a rush of orders as consumers raced to secure the subsidy. But that was a one-time surge. With the incentive gone, sales momentum is already softening, and analysts expect electric-vehicle registrations to drop sharply through the end of the year.

Tesla’s third-quarter results tell the story in numbers. Revenue climbed 12 percent to $28.1 billion but profits fell 37 percent to $1.4 billion. The surge in revenue reflected the final burst of subsidised sales, while the profit decline reflected the higher costs of doing business in Trump’s America.

How tariffs and trade wars weigh on Tesla

Although Tesla builds all its U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, its supply chain stretches across continents. The company depends on imported components, including battery minerals and electronic systems sourced from Asia and South America. Trump’s aggressive trade policies, reviving tariffs on auto parts and raw materials, have driven up those costs substantially.

Tesla’s chief financial officer revealed that tariffs added more than $400 million in expenses during the third quarter alone. These import levies hit at every level of Tesla’s production, from nickel and lithium shipments to specialised semiconductors. Even as Tesla accelerates its efforts to localise production, the sudden increase in input costs has eroded margins and dented profitability.

Trump’s trade war has also disrupted global logistics. Tesla’s factories in Germany and China, which supply vehicles and components to various markets, are facing bottlenecks and higher transport costs due to retaliatory tariffs and supply restrictions. The administration’s insistence on reshoring production may appeal politically, but for a company like Tesla with an international manufacturing footprint, it has translated into an expensive logistical puzzle.

Fading regulatory credits

For years, Tesla relied on the sale of environmental and fuel-efficiency credits to other automakers as a lucrative source. Those credits, essentially payments from polluting rivals, often turned unprofitable quarters into profitable ones. But under Trump, the government has relaxed enforcement of fuel-efficiency penalties, allowing legacy automakers to pollute more without paying steep fines. That means fewer companies now need to buy Tesla’s credits and that once-reliable income stream is dwindling fast.

The fall in credit revenue, combined with rising costs and the end of the consumer tax break, has transformed Tesla’s financial profile. What investors once viewed as a politically sheltered company now looks increasingly exposed to Trump's policy swings. The public fallout between Musk and Trump over the summer, after Musk distanced himself from the administration, only intensified the perception that Tesla is now on the wrong side of the White House.

Tesla's future hinges on innovation

Tesla’s experience in 2025 is a sharp reminder that political proximity can be a double-edged sword. The early belief that Musk’s relationship with Trump would bring regulatory advantages has proved misplaced. Instead, the administration’s broader agenda, whcih includes cutting EV incentives, easing fuel-efficiency rules, and waging trade wars, has struck directly at Tesla’s core business model.

Musk, once eager to align himself with the president, now faces the consequences of that gamble. The company’s record revenues mask deepening vulnerabilities such as a fading policy cushion, rising production costs and an uncertain demand outlook. Going forward, investors will expect Tesla's success to stem from company’s ability to innovate, adapt and operate profitably in a far less forgiving atmosphere.

JNJ,“You Gotta Love It When Life Comes Full Circle.” A MAJOR Celebrity Announces NEW Deal With Six Flags Theme Parks,Healthcare,"Some partnerships just make perfect sense. Disney X LEGO? That’s a match made in toy heaven. Benson Boone X Crumbl Cookies? We see the vision. But the latest pop culture partnership — Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs X Six Flags theme parks — is quite the surprise.

On October 21st, the JANA Partners investment firm announced it is partnering with Travis Kelce (who is currently engaged to Taylor Swift, by the way) to “enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience” at Six Flags theme parks.

Kelce released a statement on social media, reading, “To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families! Excited to partner with JANA Partners as an investor in Six Flags. So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.”

As it turns out, Kelce has been a fan of theme parks — specifically Six Flags — for a long time. In a new press release, he stated, “I am a lifelong Six Flags fan and grew up going to these parks with my family and friends,” adding, “The chance to help make Six Flags special for the next generation is one I couldn’t pass up.”

In a New Heights podcast episode, Kelce further detailed his love of theme parks. Kelce was raised in Ohio and grew up going to Cedar Point amusement park. Cedar Point’s parent company is Cedar Fair, which merged with Six Flags in 2024. Kelce’s brother, Jason, explains on the New Heights podcast that “Cedar Point is rollercoaster U.S.A.,” adding, “It is the premier roller coaster amusement park in the country.”

To all my fellow theme park and amusement park lovers. I have some exciting news!!! Couldn’t pass up the opportunity to continue the tradition and make Cedar Point and Six Flags even more special for the next generation of families! Excited to partner with JANA Partners as an investor in Six Flags. So crazy to even imagine this is real, but you gotta love it when life comes full circle.

♬ original sound – Travis Kelce

This news comes amid a flurry of headlines about Six Flags theme parks closing around the U.S.

Several Six Flags locations have announced closures, including Six Flags America in Maryland and Six Flags Great America in California (unless they extend their lease). Four other theme parks have been closed by the company in the past:

Six Flags AstroWorld was located in Houston, Texas

Six Flags AutoWorld theme park in Flint, Michigan

Six Flags New Orleans

Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom

Six Flags CEO Richard Zimmerman announced plans to step down by the end of the year following low second-quarter earnings; the company reported a $100 million loss within three months.

Why Six Flags Had To Close 7 Theme Parks

Could this new partnership boost profits for Six Flags? Kelce has not revealed how he plans to work with the company going forward. Kelce and the JANA Partners investment firm collectively own about 9% of the economic interest in the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation.

Well, we didn’t see this news coming! We’ll be curious to see how this new partnership changes things for Six Flags. In the meantime, we’re always on the lookout for the latest theme park news, so stay tuned for more.

AAPL,Should Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) Be on Your Investing Radar?,,"Launched on 09/22/2010, the Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF (VONG) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.

The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $19.96 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.

Why Large Cap Growth

Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.

While growth stocks do boast higher than average sales and earnings growth rates, and they are expected to grow faster than the wider market, investors should note these kinds of stocks have higher valuations. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.

Costs

Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.08%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.67%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 47.40% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Telecom round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 12.33% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA).

The top 10 holdings account for about 60.28% of total assets under management.

Performance and Risk

VONG seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of large-capitalization growth stocks in the United States.

The ETF has added roughly 13.39% so far this year and was up about 24.64% in the last one year (as of 08/09/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $66.09 and $98.39.

The ETF has a beta of 1.08 and standard deviation of 21.98% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 410 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Alternatives

Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VONG is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.

The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $127.03 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $269.82 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%.

Bottom-Line

Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

AAPL,"Top 2 Tech And Telecom Stocks That May Plunge This Month - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN)",,"As of Oct. 24, 2025, two stocks in the communication services sector could be flashing a real warning to investors who value momentum as a key criteria in their trading decisions.

AAPL,"How To Trade SPY, Top Tech Stocks As Market Awaits CPI Data",,"Good Morning Traders!

Today is one of the most important trading sessions of the month with the release of the Consumer Price Index for September at 8:30 AM Eastern. This report will heavily influence expectations around monetary policy over the next several meetings and could create sizable volatility if it deviates from forecasts.

At 9:45 AM Eastern, traders will receive updated readings on Manufacturing, Services, and Composite PMIs for October through the S&P Global releases. These datasets help shape the near-term outlook on economic momentum following the Fed's policy stance. Kansas City Services data at 11 AM Eastern will round out the scheduled activity.

With sentiment tightly hinged to inflation expectations, price action is likely to be fast and directional following the morning news. Manage exposure carefully, react to what the tape is showing, and set risk parameters before volatility hits.

Now, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.

SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)

SPY opens at 673.75, where buyers are looking to maintain upward momentum ahead of a major data release. A push above this level could carry price into 675.00 and 676.20, with continued strength lifting toward 677.40. If bullish participation grows on positive inflation news, SPY may stretch into 678.65 and 679.85 as investors position into the weekend. Each step higher shows increasing confidence that the market can handle the macro backdrop.

If SPY loses 673.75 off the open, sellers may press into 672.45. A failure to stabilize there can send price into 671.15 and 669.95, with heavier downside potentially reaching 668.70. If momentum accelerates, SPY could dip toward 667.45 before buyers attempt to step back in. These levels will show whether CPI triggers risk-off reactions or simply a brief reset before upside continuation.

Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)

QQQ begins the session at 613.75, where bulls will try to carry tech leadership into the new data cycle. A move above could lift price into 614.90 and 616.05, with buyers possibly driving into 617.20. If momentum strengthens, QQQ could stretch into 618.35 and 619.55. Each upward move suggests traders are rotating back into growth if inflation progresses in the right direction.

If QQQ drops below 613.75, sellers may probe into 612.50. A break of that zone could lead into 611.30 and 610.10, with continued softness reaching 608.85. If pressure intensifies, QQQ may find deeper testing into 607.60. These areas will tell us whether the market wants to lighten exposure or simply shake out weak hands on the morning reaction.

Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Apple opens at 260.50, and bulls want to keep the stock perched near its recent higher base. A hold above could drive price into 261.45 and 262.40, with added momentum lifting toward 263.35. If strength builds post-CPI, Apple may push into 264.30 and 265.25. Each leg higher reinforces the idea that investors continue to view Apple as a defensive cornerstone with upside potential.

If Apple slips below 260.50, sellers may lean into 259.55. Continued pressure could drag the stock into 258.60 and 257.65, with heavier selling reaching 256.70. If weakness expands, Apple may drift toward 255.75 before stabilizing. These zones will reveal whether a soft CPI print shakes investor confidence or simply offers fresh entries.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)

Microsoft begins the day at 521.75, where buyers will be watching for confirmation after a steady week of grind higher. A move above could send price into 522.95 and 524.20, with continued strength driving into 525.40. If demand accelerates, MSFT may stretch toward 526.65 and 527.85. Each push upward shows traders staying committed to quality mega caps through volatility.

If MSFT breaks below 521.75, sellers may target 520.55. A drop under here opens the path to 519.35 and 518.10, with heavier downside reaching 516.90. If selling firms up, the stock could test 515.70 before buyers appear. These levels will help determine how sensitive software names are to inflation expectations today.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

NVIDIA opens at 183.25, where bulls will try to show continued accumulation after recent hesitation. A move higher could lift price into 184.30 and 185.35, with momentum carrying into 186.40. If upside extends, NVDA may reach 187.45 and 188.50. Each advancement reinforces ongoing confidence in semiconductors as a leading segment.

If NVIDIA loses 183.25, sellers may pull price into 182.20. A deeper fade could expose 181.15 and 180.10, with added weakness carrying into 179.05. If pressure continues, the stock could slip toward 178.00 before catching support. These zones show where growth appetite could temporarily fade if CPI disappoints.

Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)

Alphabet starts the session at 256.25, and buyers will try to sustain its recent positive tone. A move above could push price into 257.20 and 258.15, with buyers later chasing into 259.10. If strength builds, the stock could reach 260.00 and 260.95. Each rise would highlight continued trust in communication names even during data-driven volatility.

If GOOGL fails at 256.25, sellers may drag it into 255.25. A breakdown there exposes 254.20 and 253.15, with deeper selling bringing the tape into 252.10. If momentum softens further, the stock could test 251.05 before setting a base. These levels reveal where bargain hunters could emerge if the morning numbers create a short-term dip.

Meta Platforms Inc (META)

Meta opens at 737.50, with bulls looking to extend its sturdy climb. A lift above could bring price into 739.70 and 741.85, with more aggressive continuation pushing into 744.00. If buyers remain eager, META may reach 746.20 and 748.35. Each new high signals that traders remain committed to strength in the higher beta growth names.

If META falls below 737.50, sellers may push into 735.35. Continued weakness could target 733.20 and 731.10, with heavier downside driving toward 728.95. If selling continues, the stock may slip toward 726.85 before stabilizing. These zones will show whether volatility after CPI is a brief shakeout or a warning signal.

Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

Tesla begins the morning at 446.25, and buyers will attempt to build a firmer base for continuation. A move higher could carry price into 447.85 and 449.45, with stronger participation driving into 451.00. If bullish enthusiasm increases, Tesla may stretch into 452.60 and 454.20. Each move upward shows improving conviction after weeks of consolidation.

If Tesla drops below 446.25, sellers may first probe 444.65. A loss of this level could take the stock into 443.05 and 441.50, with added weakness driving into 439.95. If pressure builds, Tesla could retest 438.40 before buyers return. These areas will be key in assessing whether risk appetite holds up on the inflation print.

AAPL,"A Simple Buffett-Inspired Portfolio You Can Build With Just $1,000",,"Key Points

Buffett is considered the greatest investor of all time.

These six stocks are representative of iconic Buffett stocks.

Just $1,000 can build a mini-Buffett portfolio.

10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›

They don't call him the Oracle of Omaha for nothing!

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and Chairman Warren Buffett is widely considered the greatest investor of all time, inspiring millions of investors along the way. Over his six decades at the helm of the giant conglomerate, he and his hand-picked team have worked to identify stocks of good companies with good management that are undervalued by the market.

It's worked extremely well. Berkshire's stock has generated a compound annual growth rate of almost 20%, double the average annual return of the S&P 500 over that time.

Why not replicate that success?

It's not difficult to build a similar portfolio by studying Buffett's methods. The current portfolio of publicly traded U.S. stocks owned by Berkshire Hathaway has more than 40 stocks and is worth more than $300 billion.

And that doesn't even include the scores of companies Berkshire owns outright, like GEICO Auto Insurance, BNSF railway, and Fruit of the Loom.

A broad portfolio

The stocks Berkshire owns minority stakes in range in price from about $8 (Liberty Latin America Series A) to more than $7,600 a share (NVR Inc). It would be extremely difficult and expensive (not to mention time-consuming) to attempt to mirror that portfolio, even if you bought just one share of each stock.

But if you have just $1,000 to invest and want to create a portfolio that looks a lot like something Buffett would hold (and does), here are six stocks to start with. And you can get a share of each for a combined total price of less than $1,000.

Six iconic Buffett stocks

1. Apple

Let's start with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the giant consumer electronics company and third-largest public company on the planet by market cap. Buffett and Berkshire first invested in Apple in early 2016 with a $1 billion share purchase and continued to increase the stake over the years. Today, Berkshire owns $69.8 billion in Apple shares. That makes it the company's largest holding, at more than 23% of its portfolio. It has netted the company a gain of 524% so far.

Apple is the only stock in this mini portfolio that's down for the year, but Buffett continues to hold it and has great confidence in its long-term prospects. The share price is currently around $249.

2. Bank of America

Berkshire made its initial investment in Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) in August 2011 by purchasing preferred stock and warrants. It converted its warrants to common stock in 2017. The national bank accounts for more than 10% of Berkshire's portfolio. And the stock is up 17% this year. Plus, it pays a nice dividend yield of 2.14%. A share costs about $51.50.

3. Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is currently Berkshire's fourth largest holdings. A big believer in holding businesses with natural economic moats, Buffett began buying the iconic beverage company's shares in 1988 because he believed it was undervalued. The stock has a yield of 3.04% and is up 9.4% so far this year. Shares trade at about $68.

4. American Express

American Express (NYSE: AXP) has been in the Berkshire portfolio since 1998, though Buffett has increased Berkshire's stake since then and it now owns nearly 22% of outstanding AXP shares worth $51.3 billion. This stock is relatively expensive, at about $340 a share. It has climbed almost 15% in 2025.

5. Chevron

Berkshire made an initial investment in the energy giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX) in 2020 and has been buying and selling since. It's one of Buffett's most actively traded holdings, and it has an attractive 4.5% yield. The stock is currently priced at around $153 a share. It's up 6% this year.

6. Nucor

Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is a steel manufacturer that Berkshire first bought back in the 1990s, considering it a great value play. Buffett purchased another 6.6 million shares this year for about $850 million. Its current price per share is about $133. The share price is up almost 14% this year.

These six stocks are spread across different sectors of the economy, from technology and energy to financials, consumer defensive, and basic materials.

Purchasing one share of each will cost a total of about $995. That will buy you a nice mini-Buffett starter portfolio. And you'll have $5 left over for a latte.

JPM,"JPMorgan (JPM) Upgrades Coinbase (COIN), Sees Potential $34 Billion Opportunity in Base Token",,"Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) upgraded Coinbase (COIN) to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" and raised its price target to $404, citing new monetization opportunities and reduced risks that make the crypto exchange appear more attractive compared to its peers.

The shares were about 4% higher in early trading, around $332.

The bank highlighted two key catalysts: a potential Base token and enhanced USDC payouts.

JPMorgan analysts said that Coinbase is exploring a token for Base, its Layer 2 blockchain launched in August 2023, which has grown into one of the largest in the ecosystem.

A token could allow Coinbase to capture more of Base’s growth, with the bank estimating a possible $12 billion to $34 billion market cap and up to $12 billion in value accruing to Coinbase. The move, JPMorgan said, could spur development, community participation and long-term infrastructure growth.

The bank's analysts also noted Coinbase’s efforts to better monetize USDC by offering yields to customers through its Coinbase One subscription service. By segmenting users and offering 4% returns to subscribers, Coinbase could add about $1 per share in annual earnings, JPMorgan said.

While competition from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remains a risk, the analysts said market share between DEXs and centralized exchanges has stabilized. It added that Coinbase’s integrated model, spanning brokerage, market making, exchange and custody, should help sustain profitability even if fees decline.

JPMorgan valued Coinbase at 50 times projected 2027 earnings, factoring in $4 billion from a potential Base token, and set a December 2026 price target of $404.",CoinDesk,2025-10-24T13:29:00Z,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/24/jpmorgan-upgrades-coinbase-sees-potential-usd34b-opportunity-in-base-token,1.0,2025-10-24 22:28:22.962308,,0.3176470588235294
JPM,"VantagePoint Vantagepoint A.I. Hot Stocks Outlook for October 24, 2025 Stocks $PSA, $QGEN, $CIEN, $LCID, $GS, $WRBY",,"Register for a Free Live Training

The Hot Stocks Outlook uses VantagePoint’s market forecasts that are up to 87.4% accurate, demonstrating how traders can improve their timing and direction. In this week’s video, VantagePoint Software reviews forecasts for Public Storage ($PSA), Qiagen ($QGEN), Ciena ($CIEN), Lucid Group ($LCID), Goldman Sachs ($GS), Warby Parker ($WRBY)

Public Storage ($PSA)

Hello again, traders, and welcome back to the Hot Stocks Outlook for October 24th, 2025. I hope you all have had an excellent week out there in the financial markets. And as always, we’re going to take a look at the most recent VantagePoint A.I. predictive forecast.

So, if you haven’t already, be sure to go ahead and click the link down in the description below, and get yourself signed up for a live demonstration to learn all the specifics about how these predictive indicators and technologies are helping traders navigate the financial markets and really make better trading decisions.

This is a really nice opportunity. We’ve seen volatility pick up in the marketplace—a good opportunity to really highlight how all of these predictive tools work together.

We can start out here with shares of Public Storage (PSA). And like with all of our previous and subsequent examples, all of this is based off of end-of-day data. Each one of these candles that you see there represents a full and complete trading day.

The first thing we’ll cover here is that right up against all that price data, you’ll notice there is a black line and also a blue line value. The black line that you’re seeing there is a simple moving average—this is a very common technical analysis indicator. The only issue with this indicator is that it always looks back, and in this instance, it’d be a 10-day moving average. So it looks back at the previous 10 close prices, adds them all together, and divides by that number.

That acts as a good baseline to let us know where market prices have been, but it really has no predictive capability—just smooths out what’s already occurred in the market.

What VantagePoint traders are able to do is compare that value to the VantagePoint proprietary predicted moving average. This number, which we can think of as a forecast of average prices looking forward on the chart, is generated through artificial neural networks performing what we would call intermarket analysis.

Rather than just looking back at past prices like traditional technical analysis, the neural networks within VantagePoint are using data from other markets—markets that are known to drive future price action, whether positive or inverse correlations. Neural networks and A.I. are good at identifying these leading and lagging relationships in the data.

This spans the global markets—individual stocks, ETF groups, global currencies, interest rates, and even particular commodities where applicable. Gold mining stocks, oil stocks—these are all driven by movements in the raw commodities themselves.

It takes this global approach, weighing dozens of market relationships, and uses that to generate highly accurate predictions. All of these VantagePoint indicators have a very high level of accuracy associated with their output, and the company continues fine-tuning the neural networks to get the best output possible.

Whenever we see this blue line cross above the black line, that suggests that these average prices should start moving higher and traders may want to look to take a long position. The distance and separation between the predicted moving average and the actual moving average are often good signs of how strong a particular trend might be.

As we look here, as far as that blue line moving above the black line going into just yesterday’s close here in Public Storage (PSA)—and a lot of storage companies generally have performed quite well over the past few weeks—you’ve got a 6–7% move here over the past 19 trading days.

But this is where things get exciting depending on what your trading strategy, approach, and timeframe really are. This is a holistic forecast—it’s not just looking at the overall trend direction. We also have this bar at the bottom of the screen which can go from green to red and back to green.

This indicator has an extremely high level of accuracy—upwards of 80-plus percent—on an extremely wide range of markets. Essentially, four out of five times this indicator will be good at anticipating whether prices will be higher or lower over the next 48-hour period.

We see how this works: as this trend moves to the upside, that neural index gets bullish and we get a lot of momentum in the market until recently, where you see that neural index go bearish, and subsequently, 48 hours later, prices are trading at lower levels.

Additionally, we’ve gone from the predicted moving average (the overall trend), to the neural index (48-hour forecast), and then to the intraday predicted high and low. This indicator utilizes that predictive data—looking at intermarket relationships—but focuses just on tomorrow’s price levels as far as a prediction of the high and the low.

As Friday trades here, we’ll get the actual market data filling in, and we can see how accurate all of those predictions are.

Looking back at previous forecasts, we can see how accurate all of these VantagePoint predictions have been. You really see how this works—getting very close to the predicted lows, moving down toward predicted lows, even seeing how the market tends to respond from those predicted highs and then trades lower from that point.

This is where traders can really utilize this information to make better trading decisions and navigate the markets more effectively. You see about three or four entries very early on here, guiding you every single day moving forward.

Even here, getting a pretty aggressive slant lower as far as that predicted trading range—and then, of course, earnings coming up here in the near future.

A very interesting opportunity again—we see a lot of these storage stocks performing well. This is where the software is very effective at identifying when these sectors start to move, allowing you to hone in on these opportunities.

Qiagen ($QGEN)

Here’s QGEN (Qiagen)—a good example again of how all of these tools work together. The predicted moving average moves above the actual moving average, neural index very bullish, but then we move down to a red configuration and run into sideways price action with subsequent 48-hour periods where that neural index goes bearish.

Once it gets bullish again, we see that momentum pick up in the market. Another day where we run sideways—but overall, clearly a market that’s in an uptrend and you’d only want to be going long and taking profit on long positions.

We see another 6–7% move just over the past few weeks, and of course, those predicted highs and lows can really help refine a lot of this. Understanding that you might want to be buying down at these predicted levels—you see a couple of days ago moving down to the predicted low and then moving up to that actual predicted high from that trading day as well.

Very interesting stuff here and again, good examples of how all the tools work together.

If your trading strategy is shorter term, maybe you want to rely on that neural index and predicted high and low. If you’re looking for position and swing trades, this is where the predicted moving averages can be very effective.

Ciena ($CIEN)

Here in Ciena Corporation (CIEN), this is a stock that really, in April, coming off of the lows, has continued to perform well. Whenever we see this forecast get bullish, it’s a good time to get involved in the market.

We see earnings here and the market really responding well. What’s really effective about VantagePoint is that even when you have these huge volatility catalysts—events that drive volatility in the market, such as big gaps—VantagePoint adapts to those market conditions and understands, “Hey, there’s been a big move here. Let’s look at those intermarket relationships and then generate all of these predictions moving forward from that point in time.”

Even when we see a lot of volatility, the software often does a good job of really adapting—getting back on track and saying, “Okay, where are these levels where we might want to accumulate a position?”

On days like this, if you’re waiting down at the predicted low, you just get filled actually at the open, and you see the market trading straight up from that point.

Many of these opportunities keep trading higher. If we look at this overall position, this has lasted over a very long period of time. As you get into these long, sustained trends, volatility and the daily ranges tend to pick up quite a bit.

You want to identify those early entry points. You see this market up about 85% now, just over the past 41 trading days, with a very solid forecast—the blue line remaining above the black line, letting us know the overall trend is still bullish.

Lucid Group ($LCID)

A couple of weeks ago, we looked at Lucid Group (LCID)—another example of how these tools adapt. As we see this blue line crossing above the black line and the neural index bullish, it really highlighted opportunities to get a position on.

You see how this works and get familiar with it as you utilize the software. Often, on these days where you take up the northern half of the range, the subsequent predicted low levels aren’t hit. The market moves right down to that level and then continues on with its uptrend.

There were numerous opportunities where we had this bullish momentum, the sustained price movement higher, and then you see this very strong move lower as the predicted high and low range and neural index before that trading day turned bearish—and all of that reverses.

The trend moves into a downtrend. You see how these predicted highs and lows now work on the bullish side or the bearish side—moving up toward the predicted high but then selling off.

Even just this past week, moving up to those predicted highs—and you’re already down about 8.5% just over the past few trading days. Clearly, this market is now in a downtrend.

If you want to benefit from the VantagePoint forecast, clearly it’s short—take profits on shorts. Previously, down at 19 was a good opportunity to get long going into early September, but you want to adapt to changing market conditions.

Goldman Sachs ($GS)

A lot of the banking stocks have been performing poorly. We looked at Regions Bank the other day; J.P. Morgan (JPM) and many of the big banks are also performing poorly.

Here we see with Goldman Sachs (GS), the stock very clearly shows the blue line crossing below the black line—again, one of these instances where the neural index gets bullish within a downtrend.

What do you get? Strength over a couple of trading days, but the overall trend is still very much bearish.

We can take a look at these predicted highs and lows and see how this works—even after this trade—saying, “All right, look for the market to trade up toward the upper part of these predicted ranges, but overall still in a downtrend where you’d want to short and take profits on short positions.”

Within 48 hours, you have that market moving down in the direction of the overall trend.

We’ll see if we get some reversals in some of these financial stocks, but currently not a great place to be positioned. The market’s down about 6%, and a lot of stocks are coming off their highs—representing a reason to be cautious.

Many stocks that performed well are now moving into downtrends—an opportunity to get out of the way, reassess, and find new bullish opportunities as we see these predicted moving averages turn bullish once again.

Warby Parker ($WRBY)

Here’s Warby Parker (WBY)—another example of the blue line crossing below the black line, with a lot of separation between the predicted moving average and the actual.

We see how this market just slips into a downtrend and continues moving lower. Very early on, moving up to the predicted high was immediately followed by selling off. Then you get these days where you scoot up toward that predicted high—but clearly, it’s a place to be a seller, not a buyer or accumulator of shares.

Overall, from this initial predicted high being hit, the market is currently down about 21% just over the past 19 trading days. This is the type of stuff you want to avoid—recognizing that conditions have shifted, predictive forecasts are getting bearish, and making sure you’re not on the wrong side of markets when they decline 20-plus percent over a short period.

JPM,JPMorgan reportedly plans to let clients borrow against their Bitcoin and Ether,,"Investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase is reportedly planning to let clients use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for loans, signaling Wall Street’s continued move toward embracing digital assets.

The initiative would allow JPMorgan’s global clients to borrow against their Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) holdings, according to a Bloomberg report published Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The offering would store clients’ Bitcoin and Ether holdings through a third-party custodian, according to people who spoke to the news outlet.

If confirmed, the development could make the two leading cryptocurrencies more attractive for institutional investors, akin to the historic approval of the first US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January 2024.

A spokesperson for JPMorgan declined to comment.

The report follows months of speculation that JPMorgan could soon accept Bitcoin and Ether ETFs as collateral.

JPMorgan continues crypto push

JPMorgan has been considering cryptocurrency-collateralized loans since at least July, when the first reports on this matter emerged.

Still, the Financial Times previously reported that adopting Bitcoin and Ether as collateral assets may not occur until 2026.

The investment bank also expressed interest in stablecoins during an earnings call on July 15, when CEO Jamie Dimon said they planned to be involved in stablecoins to better “understand” this emerging asset class.

JPMorgan was among the first US banks to venture into crypto. In 2020, it launched JPM Coin, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. In 2024, the bank reported holding shares of different spot Bitcoin ETFs.

The early integration came despite JPMorgan’s CEO previously expressing criticism of digital assets.

In 2018, Dimon said he had no interest in cryptocurrencies. In 2022, he called digital assets “decentralized Ponzi schemes,” but commented positively on blockchain and smart contract technology.",Cointelegraph,2025-10-24T13:05:51Z,https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpmorgan-bitcoin-ether-collateral-institutional-report,0.9999999999999999,2025-10-24 22:28:26.510655,,0.3019607843137255
JPM,"JPMorgan To Let Clients Use Bitcoin, Ethereum As Loan Collateral By Year-End: Report",,"JPMorgan Chase plans to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral for loans by year-end, Bloomberg reported.

The program will reportedly rely on a third-party custodian for token security.

The move highlights the bank’s growing acceptance of digital assets on Wall Street.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM), one of the largest banks in the U.S., is reportedly planning to let clients use Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as collateral for loans by the end of the year.

The bank already allows crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be pledged as collateral. The expansion to direct cryptocurrency holdings marks another step in integrating digital assets into traditional finance. According to a Bloomberg report, the bank’s upcoming program will rely on a third-party custodian to secure the tokens put up as collateral.

JPM’s stock edged 0.14% higher in pre-market trade, with retail sentiment on Stocktwits trending in ‘neutral’ territory over the past day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price rose 1.6% in the last 24 hours to cross $111,000 amid a recovering cryptocurrency market. Retail sentiment around Bitcoin remained in ‘bearish’ territory as chatter dipped to ‘normal’ from ‘high’ levels. Ethereum’s price rose 2% to trade just under $4,000. Retail sentiment around the leading altcoin also trended in the ‘bearish’ zone.

Jamie Dimon’s Evolving Stance On Crypto

The move showcases a gradual shift at JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon once said he would fire any trader at his bank if they got caught trading Bitcoin for being “stupid” and that BTC was “fraud”. Just a year ago, at Davos, he called Bitcoin a “pet rock” and said “it does nothing.”

While Dimon has remained skeptical of the sector, his tone has softened. “I don’t think we should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” he said at JPMorgan’s investor conference in May, as per Koyfin. “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin, go at it.”

The bank is now treating crypto more like conventional assets such as stocks, bonds, or gold in its lending operations – a move that aligns with the Trump administration taking a more crypto-friendly stance on the market.

JPM,"Wall Street Banks Come to the ""Rescue"" of Milei's Argentina Just Days Before Make-or-Break Elections | naked capitalism",,"A government largely run by former JP Morgan executives takes out a loan from current JPM executives (and other US banks). What could possibly go wrong?

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon landed in Buenos Aires this week to attend an event the Wall Street lender is holding, precisely at a time that the bank is in negotiations to arrange a $20 billion loan for the Argentine government. The timing was apparently pure coincidence, given the event was organised long before talk of a rescue package, reports Bloomberg:

[B]ut it means some of the bank’s top brass will be on the ground just as doubts grow that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be able to pull off the second half of his rescue package for the Javier Milei government: a $20 billion bank-led loan.

Other Wall Street banks involved include Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. If they were to activate credit lines for Argentina, it would bolster the USD 20 billion currency swap that was formalised on Monday, notes Bloomberg. Time is of the essence, however, given the country will vote in mid-term legislative elections on Sunday and the country’s peso continues to sink despite the Trump administration’s rescue package.

There’s a lot riding on the results, including that rescue package:

Dimon will be joined on his visit by the current joint chairman of JP Morgan’s International Council, Tony Blair, who will be taking a few days out from his new role as “modern-day high commissioner” of Gaza, and former US Secretary of State Condeleeza Rice, who also sits on the council. On the weekend, he will take part in a polo tournament.

Before that, Dimon is expected to meet with members of Milei’s senior economic team during his stay. He should receive a warm welcome considering all four of them, including Economy Minister Luis Caputo and Central Bank Governor Santiago Busilli, are former JP Morgan Chase executives. The following photo has been doing the rounds in recent days.

What were the odds of all four of them having previously worked for the same New York-based mega lender whose operations in Argentina are apparently expanding quite nicely right now? That same bank is now helping the Milei government carry out a sovereign debt buyback operation ostensibly aimed at “reducing the country’s cost of financing and strengthening investment in education”?

An Oligarch’s Libertarian

It was Milei’s appointment of Caputo and Bausili back in December 2023 that was the obvious tell that the fix was once again in, that Milei’s government was not going to honour his main electoral pledges to abolish Argentina’s central bank or adopt the dollar. As Yannis Varoufakis argues in an excellent piece for Unherd (and as we’ve been arguing for the past two years), Milei is not a libertarian by any means but is instead beholden to Argentina’s oligarchy:

Milei never really broke with Argentina’s sad oligarchic practices of the past. He merely rebranded a type of heist practised by a long succession of his predecessors — from Peronist Carlos Menem and anti-Peronist Fernando de la Rúa to hapless Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, whose presidency lasted a mere seven days, and, more recently, neoliberal Mauricio Macri who now supports Milei. While Milei used libertarian narratives successfully to distance himself from these people, his actual policies fail the most important libertarian litmus test.

Before you, dear reader, dismiss me as a Marxist (that I admittedly am) intent on dismissing a political opponent’s success as a dismal failure (something I avoid like a mortal sin), let me put it to you in simple, libertarian terms. If you (unlike me) truly believe in the markets’ superior wisdom, and want to rid Argentina of political constraints placed on the market mechanism, which market do you liberate first? The money market, surely. Which price distortion do you drive your chainsaw through first? The fixed (or bounded) exchange rate, unquestionably. And what is the last thing you do? Precisely what Milei did: borrow zillions of dollars, pile them up on top of an already unbearable heap of public debt, to prevent the money market from choosing freely the exchange rate of your currency.

Defending a currency as weak as the peso for almost two years is, of course, a fool’s errand, and the results have been depressingly familiar. In less than two years, the Milei government has burnt through tens of billions of dollars of foreign exchange reserves in a futile bid to keep the peso artificially high and, by extension, inflation artificially low. It has brought misery for the man in the street while making a mint for financial speculators.

Yes, Milei’s austerity has reduced inflation, but at the cost of smothering economic activity for two long years and squandering the country’s limited currency reserves. It is also utterly unsustainable. Everyone knows the moment the elections are over, the government will once again devalue the peso, sending inflation soaring once again — that’s why everyone is buying dollars despite the US’ direct support of the peso.

To avert an all-out currency collapse, the Milei government has needed not one, but two, massive $40 billion bailouts in the space of just six months — the first from the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank, the other from the US Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilisation Fund and Wall Street Banks. The half-lives of the financial interventions are growing dangerously short.

From Benign Neglect to Malign Meddling

Both of these bailouts came with big strings attached, but it is the latter that has the most onerous terms — including Trump’s exhortation to Argentine voters to choose the right party in Sunday’s election. Otherwise, he warns, the bailout funds will be withdrawn, tipping Argentina’s economy over the edge.

This, lest we forget, is occurring at the same time that the US is bombing speedboats into smithereens in both the Caribbean and the Pacific while beating the drums of war for direct military intervention in Venezuela. In recent days, it has threatened “very serious actions” against Colombia’s left-leaning governments as well as crippling tariffs against Nicaragua.

After two decades of benign neglect of Latin America (while it bombed the Middle East, Libya and Afghanistan to pieces), the US is back to its traditional practice of malign meddling in its resource-rich “backyard”. The old policy of plata o plomo (silver or lead) is back on the agenda as the Trump administration tries to drive a wedge between Latin America and China. Take the money or take a bullet: that is the option on offer.

This is not a new thing, of course. The US has been meddling in Latin America for nigh on two centuries. As Chomsky told the British journalist Seamus Milne back in 2009, US foreign policy has long been “straight out of the mafia”:

[S]ince government officials first formulated plans for a “grand area” strategy for US global domination in the early 1940s, successive administrations have been guided by a “godfather principle, straight out of the mafia: that defiance cannot be tolerated. It’s a major feature of state policy.” “Successful defiance” has to be punished, even where it damages business interests, as in the economic blockade of Cuba – in case “the contagion spreads”.

Will Trump’s overt election meddling and outright extortion practices concentrate the minds of Argentine voters, helping to tip the balance in Milei’s favour this Sunday? It’s unlikely but you never know. Milei still has millions of fanboys and girls (despite scamming thousands of them in his Libra meme coin con) and the opposition is still broadly reviled.

However, Trump’s meddling is just as likely, if not more so, to have the opposite of the intended effect. A large majority of Argentines (60%) already have a negative image of Donald J Trump while 56% have a negative image of the United States overall, according to a poll conducted for Bloomberg in April.

What’s more, the last six months of economic crisis and non-stop scandals have taken their toll on Milei’s approval ratings. The following exchange, from a recent interview of Milei on a friendly news program by Eduardo Feinmann, a presenter with a strong pro-government bias, shows just how quickly Milei’s carefully crafted image as an expert on economic matters is unravelling:

Presenter: Eighty percent of Argentineans barely make it to the end of the month, and 60 to 70% of them only make it to the 20th of the month.

Milei: How do you want me to fix that? How can I get money to the people?

Interviewer: You are the economist. You are the expert in economic growth with or without money.

In recent days, even with make-or-break elections looming, an allegedly heavily medicated Milei has refused to do any more interviews with the media, presumably at the insistence of his campaign team. As Luis Majul, another pro-government news presenter put it (emphasis my own), “Milei was going to do an interview (with us) but he took the decision not to come on in case there were questions he could not answer, which seems reasonable to me.”

An analysts’ report published by JP Morgan notes that the markets are already discounting a bad election result for Milei’s ruling Libertad Avanza party, which will make it even harder for the government to govern. However, the analysts do not rule out a sharp rebound in Argentine stocks from next week if the result exceeds expectations. As El País reported a month ago, Argentina’s stock market is the world’s worst performer in 2025.

Analysts from Wells Fargo have warned that the current exchange bands scheme “does not seem sustainable” and have predicted a further depreciation in the peso of close to 30% by the end of 2026 — the largest among all emerging currencies analysed. They also cautioned that the US Treasury’s support may offer a few days of stability – or even strength – for the Argentine peso, but it does not constitute a sustainable exchange rate policy.

In the meantime, the private sector-led rescue agreement still faces obstacles. The banks involved — including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup — are demanding clear guarantees to back the loan, either from the US Treasury or the Argentine State itself. From Perfil (translated by yours truly):

At the crux of the negotiations is the question of who will serve as guarantor of the loan: the Argentine government or the US Treasury itself. Banks are pushing for tangible backing, whether with assets, reserves or official coverage from Washington, that minimizes the risk of losses.

In this context, The Wall Street Journal points out that Argentina could offer sovereign bonds or future tax revenues as collateral, although those options are considered unviable. Local bonds are worth well below their face value, and compromising future collections could generate political rejection within the country.

Throughout history, this type of operation had solid collateral. In 1995, for example, Mexico guaranteed a $20 billion loan with oil exports during the so-called “Tequila Crisis.” By contrast, the currency swap between the Treasury and Argentina, which is also part of the $40 billion package, does not legally require collateral, increasing risks for the U.S. Treasury.

At the same time, the Trump administration is facing a gathering backlash from its MAGA base for trying to rescue Argentina, a major agricultural competitor, while the economic pain from Trump’s tariffs intensifies.

One other possible explanation that Calvi doesn’t mention is the personal and business interests of US Treasury Secretary (and former hedge fund manager) Scott Bessent. As the NYT reported a couple of weeks ago, some hedge fund managers, including Stanley Druckenmiller and Robert Citrone, both former colleagues of Bessent at Soros Asset Management, bet large on Argentina and will indirectly benefit from a financial rescue of Argentine assets.

Another major beneficiary will be the IMF, given Argentina now owes the Fund close to $60 billion. Another Argentine default, which may be inevitable anyway, could cause the institution serious embarrassment given that both of the last two bailouts, in 2018 and April 2025, were strongly opposed by senior members at the Fund, some of whom were even prepared to sacrifice their jobs rather than sign along the dotted line.

Another source of embarrassment for the Fund:

Neither the people of Argentina nor the people of the United States stand to benefit from this bailout. As reader Rabid Gandhi pointed out in a comment to Curro’s post yesterday on Latin America, the money will “barely even touch Argentine soil before being whisked away to the Caymans accounts of various hedgies and oligarchs, some of them nominally Argentines, others not even that”:

When this capital flight occurs, once again as it always has in the past, it will not be a surprise to Messers Bessent, Trump, Caputo…, because it is by design… What Argentina, the 45 million Argentines, will be getting as their ‘reward’ is a debt in USD, a central bank bereft of reserves and the concomitant austerity/cuts to social services that inevitably follow. With friends like these…

So, this leaves us with one final question: what will the Wall Street banks be asking for as collateral for its $20 billion loan? Or put another way, what does Argentina have left to plunder?

The last time the US Treasury used ESF funds to bail out another country, it was for Mexico during the 1994-5 Tequila Crisis. Not only are the Mexican people still paying off the debt for that bailout today, 27 years later, but the total amount outstanding has almost doubled in size despite the fact that the country has already paid $200 billion pesos more than the principal: the magical wonders of compound interest.

In its bailout of Mexico, the US government made sure the Mexican government put up as collateral for the loan the revenues from oil exports of Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex.

Will the Wall Street banks be demanding the same sort of treatment from Argentina’s state-owned company YPF? In its Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) field, Argentina boasts the world’s fourth largest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except China.

Such a move could be complicated, however, by a ruling issued a few months ago by US federal judge Loretta Preska — yes, the same judge who persecuted US lawyer Steven Donziger for daring to represent the people of Ecuador against Chevron — ordering the Milei government to hand over 51% of YPF to firms affected by the oil firm’s 2012 nationalisation. That ruling has been put on hold by a US appeal court but is hanging over Argentina like a sword of Damocles.

Alternatively, the Milei government could be asked to put up Argentina’s vast lithium deposits, the second largest in the world, as collateral, or even its uranium deposits. The negotiations between the Milei government and the US Treasury Department have reportedly included demands to restrict Chinese access to critical resources and prioritise agreements with U.S. companies in infrastructure and telecommunications.

The Milei government has already begun the process of privatising Argentina’s four hydroelectric power plants, and there will presumably be a lot more of that sort of thing to come — unless, of course, the people of Argentina vote overwhelmingly against Milei’s party on Sunday.

If that were to happen, Milei would effectively be stripped of the ability to rule by decree and veto, as he has done for the best part of the past two years. In which case, Bessent’s rescue package will presumably be withheld. And in that case, all bets are off.",naked capitalism,2025-10-24T10:42:44Z,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/10/wall-street-sends-in-its-big-guns-to-save-mileis-argentina-just-days-before-make-or-break-elections.html,0.7999999999999999,2025-10-24 22:28:38.558827,,0.3333333333333333
JPM,The Next Financial Crisis May Start On The Blockchain - And JP Morgan Just Opened The Door - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),,"JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) plans to accept Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) as loan collateral by year end 2025. Wall Street analysts frame this as institutional validation. Risk managers should see it differently: a 24/7 volatile asset meeting 9 to 5 banking infrastructure creates contagion pathways that didn’t exist before.

The mechanics reveal why this matters more than typical crypto adoption headlines. Traditional collateral management operates on predictable schedules. Stock markets close at 4 p.m. Eastern. Settlement happens T+2. Risk departments get nights and weekends to stress test portfolios and adjust positions. Banks manage margin requirements using playbooks refined over decades.

Cryptocurrency destroys these assumptions completely.

Bitcoin and Ethereum trade continuously across global exchanges. A 10% intraday move, catastrophic for equities, qualifies as Tuesday for crypto. When JPMorgan accepts Bitcoin as collateral for a corporate loan, it must monitor that position constantly across fragmented liquidity pools. A flash crash at 3 a.m. Sunday could instantly push loan to value ratios into danger zones, triggering automated margin calls before human oversight can intervene.

April 2025’s volatility saw Bitcoin futures markets liquidate $941 million in a single day, with long positions absorbing 90% of losses. Those dynamics played out in crypto derivatives. Now imagine them spreading across corporate credit lines, wealth management portfolios, and institutional loan books.

The Cascade Mechanics

When crypto serves as collateral for traditional loans, price shocks transmit between ecosystems in ways that amplify volatility rather than absorb it. The sequence is straightforward but unforgiving.

Bitcoin drops 15% over a weekend due to regulatory news, exchange issues, or macro shifts. JPMorgan’s risk systems flag hundreds of institutional loans now under collateralized. Automated margin calls go out Monday morning.

Borrowers face a choice: post additional collateral (cash or securities) or face liquidation. Many sell liquid assets to meet calls. As institutions dump stocks, bonds, or additional crypto to cover margin requirements, those markets decline, triggering margin calls at other banks holding similar collateral structures.

Crypto liquidations depress Bitcoin prices further, creating a feedback loop. Traditional market selling pressures equity prices, triggering wealth effects and risk off positioning across asset classes.

This played out within crypto alone during the 2022 winter. Celsius Network’s collapse, triggered by Terra/Luna’s implosion, created $20 billion in losses across 1.7 million accounts. Three Arrows Capital’s $2.4 billion in defaulted loans rippled through Genesis, BlockFi, and Voyager Digital.

Those failures stayed contained within crypto markets. What made them “just” a crypto winter rather than a financial crisis was that major banks weren’t deeply integrated yet. JPMorgan’s collateral program changes that equation.

Five-Stage Liquidation Cascade: How a Bitcoin Price Drop Triggers Systemic Contagion Across Banking and Crypto Markets

What Changed Since 2022

JPMorgan first explored Bitcoin backed lending in 2022 but shelved the project. The timing tells you everything: 2022 was crypto’s disaster year, with cascading platform failures exposing fragilities in lending models that seemed fine during bull markets.

What’s different now? Three factors: regulatory easing under the Trump administration, Bitcoin’s rally above $126,000, and surging institutional demand. But the underlying risks haven’t disappeared. They’ve been papered over by positive price action and favorable regulatory winds.

The European Central Bank’s May 2022 Financial Stability Review warned about crypto integration risks, noting that “increasing interlinkages between crypto assets and the regulated financial system” could amplify shocks. When crypto serves as collateral for traditional loans backing real world economic activity, a crypto crash doesn’t just hurt speculators. It triggers margin calls that reduce lending to Main Street businesses.

Academic research supports this concern. A 2025 study using Time Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression models found that cryptocurrency markets shifted from “shock absorbers” (pre 2020) to “risk transmitters” (post 2020), with turning points coinciding with institutional adoption. As integration deepens, crypto volatility increasingly spills into traditional markets rather than staying isolated.

The Basel III Question

Basel III capital requirements for crypto exposures take effect January 2026. The Basel Committee’s prudential framework imposes punitive capital charges on most cryptocurrencies, potentially requiring banks to hold capital equal to 100% of exposure value for “Group 2” crypto assets.

This creates a regulatory tax that could make crypto collateralized lending economically unviable at scale. If banks must set aside dollar for dollar capital against Bitcoin collateral, capital that could otherwise support 10x that amount in traditional lending, the business case collapses unless loan spreads widen dramatically.

JPMorgan is moving forward anyway, suggesting either confidence that regulations will soften or calculation that reputational and strategic benefits outweigh capital efficiency concerns. Either way, the mismatch between prudential requirements designed for stability and market innovations pushing boundaries creates regulatory gaps where systemic risks hide.

The Custody Risk Nobody Discusses

JPMorgan’s program relies on third party custodians to safeguard pledged tokens, introducing counterparty risk. Unlike traditional securities held at DTCC with deep regulatory oversight, crypto custody remains a fragmented landscape of varying security standards, insurance coverage, and operational maturity.

The 2014 Mt. Gox collapse, 2019 QuadrigaCX scandal, and ongoing exchange hacks demonstrate that custody risk in crypto isn’t theoretical. It’s operational reality. When billions in collateral sit with third party custodians, a security breach doesn’t just hurt the custody provider. It undermines collateral backing potentially hundreds of institutional loans.

This reintroduces the “trusted intermediary” model that cryptocurrency was designed to eliminate. The pitch deck promises decentralization. The reality is institutional crypto increasingly concentrating at a handful of custodians whose failure could trigger system wide crisis.

What to Watch

Several indicators will signal whether these risks remain theoretical or begin materializing:

Cross asset correlations: If Bitcoin drawdowns increasingly correlate with equity market volatility, integration is creating contagion channels rather than diversification benefits.

Liquidation events: Margin call clusters spanning crypto and traditional markets at the same time are early warnings of cascade dynamics.

Bank disclosures: As crypto collateralized loan books grow, transparency around exposure sizes, collateral haircuts, and stress testing methods becomes critical.

Regulatory response: Whether Basel III requirements soften or harden will determine whether this remains niche activity or scales to systemic importance.

The Federal Reserve and ECB have flagged these concerns in recent reports, but concrete supervisory frameworks lag market innovation. That gap between financial engineering and regulatory catch up is historically where crises germinate.

Two Systems That Don’t Speak the Same Language

JPMorgan’s decision represents integration that makes the financial system more efficient in some ways and more fragile in others. This is standard financial innovation territory: solving one problem while creating new ones nobody fully understands yet.

Financial crises rarely announce themselves with obvious warning signs. They emerge from vulnerabilities that seem manageable until they’re not. Subprime mortgages in 2008. Long Term Capital Management’s excessive borrowing in 1998. Portfolio insurance in 1987.

Each time, sophisticated institutions convinced themselves they’d properly modeled the risks. Each time, the models failed when stress hit from unexpected directions and correlations that were supposed to stay low suddenly spiked to one.

Crypto collateralized lending at systemically important banks might prove perfectly safe. Or it might be the next fragile node in a financial system that’s added complexity faster than resilience. JPMorgan’s decision to open this door after closing it in 2022 means we’re about to find out.

The real question isn’t whether this specific program causes the next crisis. The question is whether anyone’s actually figured out how to manage 24/7 volatility using risk systems designed for markets that close at 4 p.m. and settle in two days. Based on how similar innovations worked out historically, there’s reason for skepticism.",Benzinga,2025-10-24T13:56:29Z,https://www.benzinga.com/Opinion/25/10/48404891/the-next-financial-crisis-may-start-on-the-blockchain-and-jp-morgan-just-opened-the-door,0.5,2025-10-24 22:28:20.551173,,-0.09019607843137256
JPM,This Hot Quantum Computing Stock Keeps Climbing -- Here's What's Driving the Rally,,"Key Points

Rigetti Computing recently sold two of its quantum computing systems -- a positive step.

JPMorgan has announced it will make major investments in the industry, among others.

The total annual value for quantum computing usage could reach $15 billion by 2030.

10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›

Quantum computing stocks have been on a roll recently. Many popular pure-plays in the niche have surged thanks to increased investor interest, company-specific business wins, and an announcement by JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) that it's investing in the quantum computing realm. Among them, Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) has risen by nearly 200% since the start of September.

That kind of rapid run-up may give long-term investors pause, as it looks a lot like a hype-cycle bubble. Is that the case for Rigetti, or are there real reasons to invest in the stock now?

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

Rigetti is selling real quantum computers right now

While Rigetti's stock has surged quite a bit over the past few weeks, it isn't without cause. It is a pure-play with no backup plan; it's quantum computing supremacy or bust. This keeps Rigetti extremely focused on that goal, while some of the legacy big tech players involved in the technology are just looking for some success in the quantum computing realm to bolster their existing businesses.

Rigetti is attempting to take on some of those legacy players head-on with the technology path that it has selected. Unlike some of its peers that are pursuing less common technological paths, Rigetti is using superconducting qubits -- one of the most well-developed and utilized qubit technologies.

When the circuits in these machines are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, they behave in ways governed by quantum mechanics, which allows them to be used to perform quantum computing calculations. This is the same approach that giants like International Business Machines and Alphabet are using, so Rigetti's solution will need to be top-notch to survive.

However, it's already showing some signs of success. Rigetti recently announced sales of two of its quantum computing systems for a total of $5.7 million. That's not a massive sale in the grand scheme of things, but it shows that Rigetti is delivering quantum computing products right now. The Asian manufacturer and California tech start-up that made those purchases likely vetted other quantum computing solutions before deciding on Rigetti's systems, so this is a vote of confidence that its technology is among the best available right now.

Another news item that likely provided some lift to the stock was JPMorgan's announcement that it plans to invest $1.1 trillion over the next decade in industries that it views as critical to national and economic security. Under the umbrella of those investments, a $10 billion fund for 27 specific industries, including quantum computing, was also announced. Rigetti's stock surged 25% following the news, despite no specific announcement that JPMorgan would even invest in it.

However, the reason the cohort of quantum computing stocks surged was that an investment by JPMorgan would add legitimacy to the space, showcasing that a legacy Wall Street institution views quantum computing not just as a futuristic and speculative technology, but as one destined to have a real future. lThis was all exciting news for Rigetti investors, but is it too late to buy the stock now?

Rigetti Computing could have more room to run

If you shift your focus from the next few months to the next decade, it's easier to see how Rigetti could still have room to run. Rigetti estimates that the total annual value for quantum computing usage will be $15 billion to $30 billion between 2030 and 2040. That's not an outlandish projection, and I think it could be a legitimate projection.

However, the industry landscape is highly competitive, and it's unlikely that one company will run away with the lion's share of the market unless its technology is vastly superior to its rivals' offerings. If we project that Rigetti Computing can capture a 25% market share by 2035 and the annual value of the quantum computing market reaches $30 billion by then, Rigetti could be generating $7.5 billion in annual sales.

It's impossible to know for certain what kind of profit margins these companies will generate, but if it can squeeze out a 30% profit margin, Rigetti Computing could generate $2.25 billion in profits. Based on all of those assumptions, and further assuming that it trades at a reasonable 30 times earnings at that point, it would be a $67.5 billion company a decade from now. Rigetti's market cap is $15 billion currently, so that would amount to 350% upside if these projections are correct.

That's solid growth over a decade, but if that projection turns out to be wrong or if Rigetti isn't one of the clear winners in the quantum computing race, it could be worth a lot less. This is a high-risk, high-potential-reward stock, and with a lot of the hoped-for wins already baked into its stock price, the risks are too high for me.

Eventually, another market downtown will arrive, and in its wake, quantum computing stocks will likely be available at far cheaper prices. That's when I'll do my buying, as the quantum computing investment sector has gotten quite hot.

JPM,This Hot Quantum Computing Stock Keeps Climbing -- Here's What's Driving the Rally | The Motley Fool,,"Quantum computing stocks have been on a roll recently. Many popular pure-plays in the niche have surged thanks to increased investor interest, company-specific business wins, and an announcement by JPMorgan (JPM +1.69%) that it's investing in the quantum computing realm. Among them, Rigetti Computing (RGTI +7.11%) has risen by nearly 200% since the start of September.

That kind of rapid run-up may give long-term investors pause, as it looks a lot like a hype-cycle bubble. Is that the case for Rigetti, or are there real reasons to invest in the stock now?

Rigetti is selling real quantum computers right now

While Rigetti's stock has surged quite a bit over the past few weeks, it isn't without cause. It is a pure-play with no backup plan; it's quantum computing supremacy or bust. This keeps Rigetti extremely focused on that goal, while some of the legacy big tech players involved in the technology are just looking for some success in the quantum computing realm to bolster their existing businesses.

Rigetti is attempting to take on some of those legacy players head-on with the technology path that it has selected. Unlike some of its peers that are pursuing less common technological paths, Rigetti is using superconducting qubits -- one of the most well-developed and utilized qubit technologies.

When the circuits in these machines are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, they behave in ways governed by quantum mechanics, which allows them to be used to perform quantum computing calculations. This is the same approach that giants like International Business Machines and Alphabet are using, so Rigetti's solution will need to be top-notch to survive.

However, it's already showing some signs of success. Rigetti recently announced sales of two of its quantum computing systems for a total of $5.7 million. That's not a massive sale in the grand scheme of things, but it shows that Rigetti is delivering quantum computing products right now. The Asian manufacturer and California tech start-up that made those purchases likely vetted other quantum computing solutions before deciding on Rigetti's systems, so this is a vote of confidence that its technology is among the best available right now.

Another news item that likely provided some lift to the stock was JPMorgan's announcement that it plans to invest $1.1 trillion over the next decade in industries that it views as critical to national and economic security. Under the umbrella of those investments, a $10 billion fund for 27 specific industries, including quantum computing, was also announced. Rigetti's stock surged 25% following the news, despite no specific announcement that JPMorgan would even invest in it.

However, the reason the cohort of quantum computing stocks surged was that an investment by JPMorgan would add legitimacy to the space, showcasing that a legacy Wall Street institution views quantum computing not just as a futuristic and speculative technology, but as one destined to have a real future. lThis was all exciting news for Rigetti investors, but is it too late to buy the stock now?

Rigetti Computing could have more room to run

If you shift your focus from the next few months to the next decade, it's easier to see how Rigetti could still have room to run. Rigetti estimates that the total annual value for quantum computing usage will be $15 billion to $30 billion between 2030 and 2040. That's not an outlandish projection, and I think it could be a legitimate projection.

However, the industry landscape is highly competitive, and it's unlikely that one company will run away with the lion's share of the market unless its technology is vastly superior to its rivals' offerings. If we project that Rigetti Computing can capture a 25% market share by 2035 and the annual value of the quantum computing market reaches $30 billion by then, Rigetti could be generating $7.5 billion in annual sales.

JPM,Stablecoins that scale: 5 tests for real-world money,,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

The promises of stablecoins are clear: it’s a way to fuse the low-cost, speed, and transferability of digital assets with the certainty of traditional currency. At the upper bounds of what is possible, stablecoins may become the new standard of payment in the same way payment cards are replacing cash.

But living up to these promises means being able to scale. It’s relatively simple to make a stablecoin; it’s much less simple to make one that’s going to be just as usable at 100 transactions per day as it is at 100,000.

This was the focus of the late-morning keynote on the London Blockchain Conference’s Visionaries Stage: Stablecoins that scale: Five tests for real-world money.

The designated hitter was Dr. Berhnhard Kronfellner from Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Surveying the crowd, he muses that perhaps stablecoins don’t need five tests at all, because there’s a more useful indicator already in the room with us.

“The crowd has changed from people wearing hoodies to people that are wearing suits. So this is actually – without the five tests – the first indicator that stablecoins and digital assets have already become in the interest of the big banks, the big brands, and it will be the world’s new money.”

Nonetheless, Dr. Kronfellner sets out the five tests:

Additional value

Use cases

Revenues

Regulations

CBDC-Co-existence

To start with ‘additional value,’ Dr. Kronfellner shows two images side by side: one warped, pot-hole-stricken road, and another smooth, 20-lane megahighway. Stablecoins, in essence, are the megahighway.

In a world of innovations, things like booking overseas accommodation have been disrupted by Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) and have never been easier. But when you want to transfer money to the other side of the world, you could be looking at five banking days.

Stablecoins can do for money what Airbnb did for accommodation, in other words.

Dr. Kronfellner lists five benefits stablecoins help unlock:

Lightning-fast transactions

Reduced transaction costs

Enhanced transparency

Programmability and automation

Global accessibility and financial inclusion

He also reminded the crowd that the real use cases these benefits might transform into are still being discovered.

“When a new technology like the Internet 20 years ago—with exchanging emails, first webpages, and so on—no one had a clue that 20 years later, with Instagram, we might see influencers that have followers and make a good living out of it.”

The message is this: the use cases that we see right now, such as crypto trading, are just the beginning. Five or ten years from now, perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) agents will help us exchange money, buy things, and invest.

Another question: Are companies across the value chain building viable business models? It’s not enough to merely have a use case for stablecoins; the use case has to make money.

Some certainly are, Dr. Kronfellner explained. Tether made $13 billion in profit last year from a mere 100 employees. Little wonder, then, that banks are expending effort to enter the space.

Exactly what form the banks’ entry into stablecoins might take is an open question. Dr. Kronfellner discusses the potential avenues banks are exploring—they could offer wallets or custody, issue their own stablecoin, create a consortium with others to issue a stablecoin, issue tokenized deposits (as JPMorgan (NASDAQ: JPM) has done), or they could simply do nothing, and wait and see which coins emerge as the winners.

“For some banks, this makes sense. They will see that the revenue will be reduced and decrease in cross-border transactions or other typical stablecoin use cases and some clients will go away. But not being a first-mover, for a tier 3 bank, might be good.”

Regardless, Dr. Kronfellner says that BCG sees stablecoins as a net opportunity for banks. The downsides are reducing; the upsides are growing.

What’s next? Dr. Kronfellner says he sees a run for APYs. Soon, people will keep stablecoins in their wallets as a store of value and start questioning how they can get yields on their portfolio as they do with cash. New platforms may emerge from traditional banks or payment service providers to offer people an APY on stablecoins.

AI agents are another area Dr. Kronfellner anticipates growing: AI agents will help us to use our stablecoins in our wallets to transfer money, or we can ask our AI agent to find out if there’s a cheap way to buy into the building with X amount of money. If the apartment building is already tokenized, the AI agent will return with a quote of how much fractional ownership would cost.

Dr. Kronfellner kept returning to the same point—from the banking perspective, the upsides for stablecoins are growing, while the downsides are starting to disappear.

XOM,Exxon Mobil's Q3 2025 Earnings: What to Expect,,"Spring, Texas-based Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) operates as the largest American oil & gas company. It engages in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. and internationally. Valued at $489 billion by market cap, Exxon operates through Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments.

The energy giant is set to release its third-quarter results before the markets open on Friday, Oct. 31. Ahead of the event, analysts expect Exxon to deliver a non-GAAP profit of $1.78 per share, down nearly 7.3% from $1.92 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. On a positive note, the company has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.

For the full fiscal 2025, analysts project Exxon to deliver a non-GAAP EPS of $6.79, down 12.8% from $7.79 in fiscal 2024. However, in fiscal 2026, its earnings are expected to rebound 10.5% year-over-year to $7.50 per share.

XOM stock prices have declined 3.6% over the past 52 weeks, notably lagging behind the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLE) marginal 94 bps dip and the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 16.2% gains during the same time frame.

Exxon Mobil’s stock prices dropped 1.8% in the trading session following the release of its mixed Q2 results on Aug. 1. The quarter was marked by the highest Q2 upstream production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago. It was also the company’s best quarter yet for high-value product sales volumes in product solutions. However, due to lower commodity prices, the company’s topline for the quarter dropped 12.4% year-over-year to $81.5 billion, missing the consensus estimates by 1.6%. Meanwhile, its adjusted EPS dropped 23.4% year-over-year to $1.64, but surpassed the Street’s expectations by 10.1%.

Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about the stock’s longer-term prospects. XOM maintains a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 27 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 15 “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” 10 “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.” Its mean price target of $126.12 suggests an 8.7% upside potential from current price levels.",Barchart.com,2025-10-24T06:37:23Z,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/35653319/exxon-mobil-s-q3-2025-earnings-what-to-expect,1.0,2025-10-24 22:28:59.134304,,0.3019607843137255
XOM,3 Integrated Energy Stocks Standing Tall Despite Soft Oil Price,,"The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) expects rising inventories of oil to hurt crude prices. The soft crude pricing environment is thus likely to affect the integrated energy players' exploration and production operations. At the same time, the rising demand for renewable energy adds uncertainty to the prospects of the Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry, creating a bleak outlook.

Among the companies in the industry that will probably survive the business challenges are Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM, Chevron Corporation CVX and BP plc BP.

About the Industry

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry covers companies primarily involved in upstream, midstream and downstream operations. These companies have upstream businesses in the United States (including prolific shale plays and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico), Asia, South America, Africa, Australia and Europe. Midstream operations of energy companies entail transporting oil, natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products. In downstream businesses, the firms buy raw crude to produce refined petroleum products. The companies’ downstream activities involve chemical businesses that manufacture raw materials for making plastics. The integrated players are now gradually focusing on renewables, leading to the energy transition. The firms aim to lower emissions from operations and cut the carbon intensity of the products sold.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Industry

Soft Oil Price to Hurt Cash Flows: In its latest short-term energy outlook, EIA projected the average spot price for West Texas Intermediate crude at $65 per barrel for 2025 and $48.50 per barrel for 2026. Both the projected prices were significantly lower than $76.60 per barrel in 2024, per EIA data. The expectation for lower oil prices will probably lead to a decline in cash flows from the upstream business.

Slowdown in Production Growth to Hurt Upstream Business: There has been a slowdown in oil production growth in the upstream businesses of integrated energy companies in the United States due to shareholder demands for a greater focus on returning capital rather than investing in production expansion. As production growth slows, output decreases, which can lead to reduced revenues. Since upstream operations depend heavily on volume to generate income, any stagnation in production growth has a direct and negative impact on their bottom line.

Growing Demand for Renewables a Concern: Governments, investors and stakeholders are placing growing emphasis on addressing climate change, leading to an increased demand for renewable energy. Consequently, the demand for products reliant on oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids is expected to decline, with solar and wind energy gaining prominence in the energy landscape. The integrated energy firms are adversely impacted by these trends as they are primarily engaged in the production and transportation of fossil fuels, such as oil, and selling refined petroleum products.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish Prospects

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry is part of the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #220, which places it in the bottom 9% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Underperforms Sector and S&P 500

The Zacks Oil and Gas Integrated International industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.

The industry has gained 3.6% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s surge of 19% and the broader sector’s improvement of 4.8%.

One-Year Price Performance

Industry's Current Valuation

Since oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt.

On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 4.50X, lower than the S&P 500’s 18.57X. It is also below the sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 5.05X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.54X and as low as 2.75X, with a median of 4.12X.

XOM,Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Rises On US Sanctions Against Russian Oil - Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM),,"Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) shares are trading marginally higher Thursday, benefiting from a sector-wide rally after the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil. The news sent West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures soaring over 5% to above $61 a barrel.

XOM is performing well relative to peers. Stay ahead of the curve here.

What To Know: These sanctions are causing XOM stock to rise due to the basic principles of supply and demand. By targeting major Russian producers, the U.S. is effectively removing a significant amount of oil from the global market. This reduction in supply, assuming demand remains constant, drives the price of crude oil higher.

For an integrated oil and gas company like Exxon Mobil, higher oil prices directly translate into greater revenue and higher profit margins for every barrel it produces and sells. Investors anticipate this boost to Exxon’s profitability, making the stock more attractive and pushing its share price upward.

Traders and investors are meanwhile watching for Exxon’s upcoming earnings report on October 31. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $1.81 per share on revenue of $84.87 billion for the quarter.

Benzinga Edge Rankings: According to Benzinga Edge stock rankings, the company boasts a strong Value score of 77.65.

XOM Price Action: Exxon shares were up 0.98% at $115.83 at the time of publication on Thursday. The stock is trading within its 52-week range of $97.80 to $123.21.

From a technical perspective, Exxon is trading approximately 3.1% above its 50-day moving average of $112.09 and about 5.2% above its 200-day moving average of $109.82.

These indicators suggest that the stock is in a bullish trend, with the potential for further gains if it can maintain its position above these key moving averages.

How To Buy XOM Stock

By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Exxon Mobil – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.

Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy “fractional shares,” which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.

In the case of Exxon Mobil, which is trading at $115.83 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 0.86 shares of stock.

If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to “go short” a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.

XOM,"Energy Outlook: Volatility, Tech Shifts, And Smart Investments - Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM)",,"Market Uncertainty Redefines Energy Strategies

This year has put the energy sector in a not so stable territory, with crude oil prices seesawing due to a potent mix of trade disputes, supply chain upheavals, and geopolitical unrest. From the Gulf of Mexico to the Middle East, traditional market cycles have given way to a profound restructuring of energy security and independence. Investors now face a landscape where stability hinges on adapting to these disruptive forces rather than relying on past patterns.

Geopolitical Triggers Fuel Price Swings

The driving forces behind this volatility include escalating U.S.-China trade frictions, marked by new energy tariffs, and Europe's carbon border measures, which are reshaping global energy flows. Ongoing instability in regions like Iran, Venezuela, and parts of Africa adds a layer of risk to every oil barrel, pushing prices into unpredictable territory and demanding sharper risk assessment from market players.

U.S. Shale Adapts to a Stabilizing Role

U.S. shale, once a game-changer, now serves as a steadying influence amid supply challenges. Its growth momentum has slowed due to high interest rates, escalating service costs, and maturing fields, especially in the Permian Basin. Producers are shifting toward financial prudence over expansion, making shale a reactive player. Looking to 2026, it will support market balance rather than drive aggressive output.

OPEC+ Balances Control Amid Growing Challenges

OPEC+ continues to wield influence by fine-tuning production targets with precision, aiming to assert dominance rather than oversupply. However, internal discord and competition from non-OPEC sources, including a projected 1.3 million barrels per day increase in 2025 per IEA data, test its authority. The cartel's modest November 2025 quota hike of 137,000 barrels per day signals caution, with idle reserves of 3-6 million barrels per day adding psychological pressure on prices.

LNG Markets Shift with Geopolitical Weight

Natural gas dynamics are also evolving geographically. Europe's demand rises with colder winters, while Asia leans on domestic coal amid weaker industrial activity due to trade tensions. North American producers seize this shift, expanding LNG exports from British Columbia to the Gulf Coast, with long-term deals to Europe doubling as geopolitical leverage alongside commercial gains.

Tech Innovations Reshape Energy Operations

Parallel to these shifts, technology is transforming the industry. Oil companies cut exploration costs with A.I.-powered reservoir modeling, while solar gains ground with cheaper production and higher efficiency. Carbon capture paired with enhanced oil recovery and hydrogen experiments in transport and power generation signal progress, though scalability lags. Electric pumps in fracking and upgraded gas turbines boost output, bridging fossil fuel reliance, while electrification reshapes refined product demand.

Investment Landscape: Stability vs. Opportunity

Energy stocks trail commodity prices, reflecting ESG pressures, regulatory shifts, and renewable competition. Yet, opportunities persist for those with rigorous research. Large-cap firms like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), with strong balance sheets and transition investments (e.g., Guyana deepwater, Permian dominance), offer resilience. Mid-caps like Cheniere Energy thrive in M&A and LNG, while juniors with niche assets (e.g., Antero Midstream (NYSE: AM) ) face survival challenges without partnerships.

M&A and Portfolio Strategies for Resilience

North American M&A is set to rise, focusing on LNG, carbon capture, and low-carbon chemicals for efficiency and transition alignment. Despite renewable growth, oil and gas remain vital for aviation and heavy transport, favoring producers with low-cost reserves and geopolitical safeguards.

Q4 2025: A Crossroads for Energy Decisions

XOM,"Wall Street's Week Ahead: Megacap-led earnings deluge, Fed meeting headline busy U.S. markets week",,"The U.S. stock rally confronts a potentially consequential week to keep its momentum heading into year-end, including a flood of corporate results headlined by megacap companies and a likely interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting.

U.S.-China trade tensions could come to a head in the coming days, while a persistent U.S. government shutdown further unsettles the backdrop for investors.

Stocks have weathered increased volatility this month, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, after a 35-per-cent climb since its low for the year in April. The benchmark index is up over 14 per cent year-to-date.

Given that the market has rallied for several months without a particularly significant decline, equities could remain choppy in the days ahead, said Chris Fasciano, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.

“What we need to see is continued earnings beats and corporate America talking positively about the economy,” Fasciano said. “When people start to get nervous, it’s when they see consumer confidence coming down, or business confidence coming down.” Third-quarter earnings season is off to a solid start overall, despite disappointments this week from companies such as streamer Netflix (NFLX-Q) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN-Q).

Including results from 130 companies that have reported, S&P 500 profits are estimated to have increased nearly 10 per cent from a year ago, according to LSEG IBES data as of Thursday. So far, 86 per cent of companies have topped analysts’ earnings estimates and 81 per cent have beaten revenue estimates - both higher than historically typical rates.

Next week is the busiest of the season, with over 170 companies expected to report. They include Microsoft (MSFT-Q), Apple (AAPL-Q), Alphabet (GOOGL-Q), Amazon (AMZN-Q) and Meta Platforms (META-Q), five of the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of companies with huge market capitalizations whose shares dominate equity indexes and which overall have posted outsized profit growth over the past couple of years.

Their profit edge over the rest of the index is narrowing, but the Magnificent Seven are still expected to post stronger results this period. Earnings for the group are expected to rise 16.6 per cent against an 8.1 per cent rise for the rest of the index, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG.

A number of the megacap companies are also key players in the artificial intelligence industry, enthusiasm for which has been a main driver of stock market performance.

“The factor that is probably going to have the most influence between now and the end of the year is going to be these big tech (reports),” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “The hurdle rate is very high for these companies coming into next week’s earnings.”

Other companies due to report results next week include drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY-N), oil majors Exxon (XOM-N) and Chevron (CVX-N) and payment firms Visa (V-N) and Mastercard (MA-N). The Fed is widely expected to lower its current benchmark rate of 4 per cent-4.25 per cent by another quarter percentage point when it decides on policy on Wednesday. With that already factored into asset prices, markets are likely to be more sensitive to any forward-looking language from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, with the central bank expected to cut rates further at its next meeting in December.

“The biggest impact would be if the Fed gave any signs that they will deviate from their rate-cutting path,” said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist for Morningstar Wealth. Possibly clouding the Fed’s decision-making ability is the lack of data provided by the government since its shutdown began on October 1, including delays in employment releases at a time of simmering worries about the health of the labor market.

An increasingly extended shutdown - which has already lasted longer than the average length of past shutdowns - also likely poses more risk to economic growth, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.

“The longer it drags on, the more the market will not be able to ignore it,” Hogan said. Investors also largely had shrugged aside trade-related risks in recent months, but renewed U.S.-China rifts have brought tensions between the world’s two largest economies back to the fore.

U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month threatened significantly higher tariffs on China to take effect November 1, after Beijing imposed export controls on rare earths. Investors will be watching developments around an anticipated meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming week to see if the nations can calm tensions between them.

“If tariffs rise to the levels that President Trump is threatening on China ... you would see a more volatile and probably a more negative reaction in the market, especially if (investors) anticipate that that’s going to be lasting,” Saglimbene said.",The Globe and Mail,2025-10-24T10:16:18Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-wall-streets-week-ahead-megacap-led-earnings-deluge-fed-meeting/,0.6,2025-10-24 22:28:42.869985,,0.1686274509803922
XOM,Why This Texas-Based Company's Stock Could Reward Long-Term Investors,,"Key Points

Exxon is one of the best companies in the global oil industry.

The energy company has a plan to deliver meaningful earnings and cash flow growth over the next several years.

It should have plenty of fuel to continue returning cash to investors.

10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobil ›

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is the undisputed leader of the global oil industry. Last quarter, its $7.1 billion of earnings and $11.5 billion of cash flow from operations led all international oil companies (IOCs). Exxon also has an industry-leading balance sheet, returned more cash to shareholders than anyone in the oil patch last quarter, and has delivered peer-leading total shareholder returns over the past five years.

The Texas-based oil giant -- Exxon's global headquarters is just north of Houston -- is in a strong position to continue rewarding its shareholders in the coming years. Here's a look at what fuels that optimistic view.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now, when you join Stock Advisor. See the stocks »

Exxon's bold plan to 2030

ExxonMobil operates under multi-year plans. Late last year, the global oil giant unveiled its plan to 2030. The company's long-term investment strategy aims to deliver an additional $20 billion in annual earnings and $30 billion in incremental cash flow by 2030. This outlook implies the company will deliver 10% compound annual earnings growth and 8% compound annual cash flow growth over the next five years. Those are solid growth rates for such a large company, especially in the volatile energy sector.

The energy company isn't banking on higher oil prices to fuel its earnings growth plan. Exxon can achieve its earnings growth target at an average Brent oil price (the global oil market benchmark) of $65 a barrel in 2030. While that's higher than the current price near $60 a barrel, Brent was over $70 a barrel at the time Exxon published its long-term outlook, and was just at its 2030 target price point a few weeks ago.

Instead, the main fuel source is Exxon's plans to invest $140 billion into high-return major capital projects and its Permian Basin development program over the next five years. Notable focus areas include expanding its world-class operations in Guyana, continuing to build out its global liquefied natural gas (LNG) capabilities, and growing its leading products solutions business by developing new petrochemical and refining projects worldwide. It's also investing in several low-carbon energy businesses, including plans to build a leading lithium business in the coming years. Exxon expects to earn returns in excess of 30% over the life of these investments.

Additionally, Exxon plans to continue executing its industry-leading structural cost savings initiative. Since 2019, Exxon has delivered $13.5 billion in structural cost savings, surpassing the total of all other IOCs combined. The company expects to achieve $18 billion in cumulative structural cost savings by 2030, further boosting its bottom line.

Returning its growing cash flow gusher to shareholders

Exxon estimates that its strategic plan can generate $165 billion in cumulative surplus cash through the end of 2030 after funding its massive capital investment target. The company has the flexibility to return most, if not all, this money to shareholders.

Exxon currently has the top balance sheet in the oil patch. The company finished the second quarter with an industry-leading net debt-to-capital ratio of 8%, bolstered by a cash balance of $15.7 billion. This provides the company with tremendous financial flexibility to continue investing in its business and returning cash to shareholders, even during periods of lower oil prices.

As a result, it will undoubtedly continue increasing its dividend, something it has done for 42 straight years. That leads the oil sector. Only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have reached that level of consecutive annual dividend increases. This growth will add to Exxon's already attractive dividend, which currently yields 3.5%, nearly triple the S&P 500's level of less than 1.2%.

Additionally, Exxon will also continue to repurchase a meaningful amount of its shares each year. The company plans to repurchase $20 billion of its stock this year and a similar amount in 2026, assuming favorable market conditions. It could buy back even more shares in 2027 and beyond, especially if oil prices improve.

A potentially very enriching plan

Exxon has delivered leading total shareholder returns over the past five years by expanding its global energy business and maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Looking forward, the company's clear commitment to delivering healthy earnings growth and robust capital returns puts it in a strong position to continue growing shareholder value. This high return potential makes Exxon a compelling long-term investment.

JNJ,Tylenol-Maker Kenvue's Stock Is Down 30% in 2025. Its Fate May Be in the FDA's Hands.,,"Net cash flow from operating activities was another bright spot, coming in at $1 billion for the first six months of 2025, significantly higher than the previous year’s figure of $727 million. Overall, Kenvue closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.07 billion, lower than its short-term debt levels of $1.55 billion. The gap may not look material now, but the company should take steps to mitigate the decline in revenue and earnings so that its liquidity situation does not get out of hand.

Kenvue Has Been Here Before and Survived

What should give shareholders confidence is that Kenvue’s Tylenol was at the center of negative headlines before. In the 1980s, seven people died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol. But the company is still here (and now spun off from Johnson & Johnson), and so is Tylenol, with no less than a billion dollars of sales last year.

This is because Tylenol continues to stand out as a preferred over-the-counter option for pain relief in the U.S. and many other countries, backed by decades of reliable performance and user confidence. For decades, medical professionals have turned to it first for tackling everyday pains or fevers, which has built up a brand following that’s a real hurdle for anyone trying to step in.

Kenvue, meanwhile, spreads its wings globally, balancing out its footprint across different regions and lines of business to better weather economic shifts. This kind of setup lets the company bring fresh products to market more nimbly and get them circulating worldwide with less friction. Driving that forward is a strong international R&D operation, pulling together 1,600 experts across science, healthcare, pharmacy, and engineering, giving it the heft for faster iteration and development of products.

Finally, the true strength of Kenvue’s position rests on how effortlessly its products have become embedded in consumers’ everyday habits. These span core areas such as personal hygiene, skincare, cosmetics, and essential categories like oral health and infant care. As staples in routine use, the brands have achieved deep market penetration and strong consumer endorsement. This foundation allows Kenvue to maximize revenue potential from its well-established portfolio.

Nanobiotix has completed the transfer of NANORAY-312 sponsorship, initiated in 3Q2024, in the majority of regions along with the transfer of full operational control of the Phase 3 clinical trial to Johnson & Johnson (“J&J”).

About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)

JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel, potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate’s mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global, randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.

Given the Company’s focus areas, and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3, Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy, in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad, comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.

2025-10-24 -- NBTX -- Update to NBTXR3 Clinical Program -- FINAL",Taiwan News,2025-10-24T06:41:02Z,https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/6227494,0.4,2025-10-24 22:29:22.605168,,-0.08235294117647063
JNJ,NANOBIOTIX Announces Updates to JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) Clinical Program Following Transfer of Ongoing Phase 3 Head and Neck Cancer Trial Sponsorship and Operational Control - Nanobiotix (NASDAQ:NBTX),,"PARIS and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ:NBTX – the ‘‘Company''), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer and other major diseases, today announced updates to the JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) clinical development program.

Nanobiotix has completed the transfer of NANORAY-312 sponsorship, initiated in 3Q2024, in the majority of regions along with the transfer of full operational control of the Phase 3 clinical trial to Johnson & Johnson (""J&J""). Following the transfer and Nanobiotix analysis of the latest information, Nanobiotix estimates that NANORAY-312 interim data will be analyzed and reported, after both the requisite number of events have been observed and the last patient has been recruited, in 1H2027.

Future guidance related to NANORAY-312 and other JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)-related J&J-sponsored studies will be communicated by J&J. Nanobiotix will continue to provide JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) clinical development updates and guidance related to Nanobiotix-sponsored studies as well as studies sponsored by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

About JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3)

JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is a novel, potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas through a successful randomized Phase 2/3 study in 2018. The product candidate's mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy, subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA, Nanobiotix believes that JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Radiotherapy-activated JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or combination therapy. The program is led by NANORAY-312—a global, randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) activated by radiation therapy, with or without cetuximab, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.

Given the Company's focus areas, and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3, Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy, in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad, comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023, Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of JNJ-1900 (NBTXR3) with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, a Johnson & Johnson company.
