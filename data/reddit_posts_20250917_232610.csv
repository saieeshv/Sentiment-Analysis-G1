1njcfnv,wallstreetbets,GOOG ONE-TRICK FREE MONEY BULL CASE,"Jpow might fuck us today so let me give you a generational buy opp. I've been picking up goog $GOOG on every dip, and i'm here to tell you why this shit is literally free money.

**POSITION: 75% OF MY PORT.**

# THE CORE

* **SEARCH & ADS (NOT A MONOPOLY KEK).**  This is the free-money printer.
* **THE WAR CHEST (CASH AND BUYBACKS)** They're sitting on **$100B+ IN CASH** making billions in interest. AND they're pumping their own stock with a **$70B BUYBACK** program.

# THE HYPER-GROWTH

* **GEMINI: #1 APP ON THE APPLE STORE.** Their model is already the best. Rumor is **Gemini 3.0 is going to eat even more ass**. They have the best photo editing, best video generation, and just bought windsurf. They are winning the AI race right now, and it's not even close. GPT5 worse than Gemini pro v2.5 lmaoooo.  Flash cost nothing and gemini will always offer this for free
   * ""**Transformers was one of research leadership. They gave the blueprint to the entire world in June 2017, and within 12-18 months, the entire AI industry, including Google itself, was building on it.**""
* **TPUs.** This is the hardware *literally built for LLMs* (which is half the stock market now).  They can start selling the shovels in a 20-trillion-dollar gold rush.
   * ""Google was using its own large-scale, custom AI hardware for two full years before its main competitor""
* **AI INCREASING MARGIN**  They're plugging this LLMS *directly into the ad engine* and this means higher margins on their main money-printer. They're using AI to make the printer go *faster*.
* **CLOUD** \- GCP is growing at **30%+ YOY** and is ripping market share straight from AWS and Azure. This is the growth engine.

# THE MOAT

* **YOUTUBE.** This is video, streaming, TV, *everything*. It's the most-watched platform in the world, and Shorts is knee-capping TikTok BY ORACLE
* **ANDROID + PLAY STORE :** hey own the OS for **70%+ of all phones on earth**. Every app, every in-game purchase Google gets a cut. Bless apple
* \*\*CHROME .\*\*They own the browser that literally everyone uses.  They literally PAY firefox to exist.
* **GOOGLE MAPS:** It's a monopoly. Every other app (Uber, Zillow) pays Google to use their maps. Plus, it's the front door for all local ads. They own navigation.
* **WORKSPACE (Gmail/Drive)** They own the productivity suite for half the planet, and now they're plugging Gemini right into it.
* **SEARCH-DATA:** Yes they know everything about you.  Yes they have the most data in the world

# THE MOONSHOTS

* **GOOGLE VENTURES (The In-House Degen Fund)**  Did you know Google is basically a VC fund?
   * **14% of ANTHROPIC** (Valuation $200B üöÄ)
   * **8% of SPACEX** (Valuation $400B üöÄ)
   * ...plus they free-rolled into **UBER** and **SLACK**.
* **WAYMO:** Self-driving cars. The private market says this bet has **4x'd since last year**. This is the future of transport.
* **DEEPMIND & ISOMORPHIC LABS:** This is the AlphaFold shit. They are using AI to discover new drugs and cure diseases. This alone is a multi-trillion-dollar lotto ticket.
* **VERILY** The life-sciences bet. This shit already raised **$3.5 BILLION**. It's only going up.
* **QUANTUM** This is the long-term bet. If this pays off, they win....and they will.

# THE ""OH YEAH, THEY OWN THAT TOO"" LIST

* **HARDWARE (Pixel, Nest, Home)**
* **INFRASTRUCTURE (Google Fiber, Voice)**
* **REAL ESTATE (The Landlord)** They own infinite prime-ass real estate. Chelsea Market in NYC? That's theirs.
* **CRYPTO:** Yes. They're building a L1.

1niobby,wallstreetbets,$MSTR: Setup for a Pop Tomorrow,"
I‚Äôm eyeing MicroStrategy ($MSTR) hard right now and loaded up on some calls ahead of tomorrow‚Äôs Fed decision (September 17, 2025). Stock‚Äôs at $331 after pulling back from $457 highs, but with their 639,000 BTC stash worth $70B+ at $115K per coin, this thing‚Äôs basically a turbocharged Bitcoin play trading at 1.2x its holdings. Q2 crushed with $32.60 EPS, and targets are $540-$700 easy if BTC holds steady.
Fed‚Äôs slamming through a 25 bps cut with 96% odds, and if Powell hints at more easing, BTC should run while stocks might dip on jitters. $MSTR loves that setup, lower rates make Saylor‚Äôs debt buys cheaper, and it‚Äôs got 2-3x leverage to BTC moves. Last year‚Äôs cut? $MSTR jumped 12% in a week.

Big catalysts stacking: It‚Äôs heavily shorted (15%+ of float, all-time highs in Q2), shorts are bleeding from past rallies, and whales are piling in, grabbing BTC and $MSTR options like it‚Äôs on sale. On-chain shows whale inflows spiking, MicroStrategy just added 525 BTC last week. This screams gamma squeeze potential, especially with options flow heavy on calls (2.21 ratio) and triple witching Friday. Break $350, and it could rip to $375 quick.

Plus, Saylor‚Äôs in DC today pushing the Bitcoin treasury bill with lawmakers, aiming for the US to stock up 1M BTC over five years as a strategic reserve. If that gains traction, it‚Äôs rocket fuel for $MSTR as the poster child.
Chart‚Äôs coiling at $328-$334 support, RSI oversold, volume building. Risks if Powell‚Äôs hawkish, but jobs data‚Äôs weak, so I like the odds. Not advice, just why I‚Äôm bullish tomorrow.

1nik3on,wallstreetbets,$LDI - #derisk / unleverage -- now a freeroll,"TLDR: Risk profile changed - so sold calls, picked up 50k LDI shares as a freeroll, let it ride üöÄ

\----

I don't understand the risks involved on LDI - so I can't price risk well but still wanted exposure. Chat didn't convince me price action on my options were safe from rate cuts, but I wasn't convinced they were going to drop either. So risks were high. Unlikely I follow LDI any longer past this unless it dips a lot -- I try to identify underpriced risk, which when these options were bought last week was good value. Time to find the next play. $LDI did 100b in loans a few years ago and likely to fly longer term on rate cuts / cycle. I'm unsure how long that takes / where this goes (but wanted investments still) - so deleveraged. I liked what I found, but risks are high. I \*trade\* options and invest in shares. DYOR.

I've made it very clear to chat several times that I use options to leverage my bets & take gains very quickly. I take gains out all the time. These were higher yesterday - todays timing and rate cuts coming make the risk on these higher. Longer term likely a good bet - so still invested quite heavily (50k shares). My strategy is really is this simple: buy the dip, sell the run. These were bought on the dip last week, and if it dips again I may look for another options play on them again.

My risk on these is now 0, so I don't have to follow in depth anymore. I only follow a few tickers at once. I papered out at the bottom this morning, it's up \~4% since I did this.

\----

Update: Bought puts at EOD to hedge share risk (not posted). CEO sold all his shares today, saw this at \~4pm today (IE: AH, markets closed). That's all the bearish confirmation I need.  I'm fully out tomorrow / potentially short / puts. Goodluck chat

1niqztt,wallstreetbets,DD - CVNA and COF are overvalued,"TLDR: CVNA (Carvana) 300Put Jan2026, Jun2026 + COF (Capital One Financial) 200 Put Jun2026

Won't go much into CVNA as its been heavily discussed before, along with the much more comprehensive deep dive into their financials since a while back by [Hindenburg Research.](https://hindenburgresearch.com/carvana/) But I believe that while their books are cooked, the financial pressure will be too much to hide soon.

To preface this, I understand that during economic (non-market) downturns, stocks that deal with poor financial decisions like credit cards and used cars might seem like good investment, but the current situation is different than that of 2008 or 2020. Biggest reason being, [for the first time since 1960'](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/immigrant-population-shrinking-trump-administration-rcna225881)s  US population is shrinking due to the new immigration policies.

These ""recession-proof stocks"" are at very big risk simply because they finance lower income, and often time immigrants, with little to no requirements. They do not care if you're an ""illegal"" immigrant (as long as you have an ITIN), they do not care if you have no/bad credit history, and they do not check if you have the ability to pay them back. Normally this would be fine as even if you default on the loan/debt they will claw much of it back because people usually do not file for bankruptcy and tend to make the minimum payments or work with them for a new payment plan. They can also garnish your wage or seize assets if you declare bankruptcy.

Well then you might ask, how can they fail?

**COF (Capital One Financial)**

Many of the immigrants that are being deported or are self deporting, simply max out their credit before leaving. In fact, during the six month period of January to June 2025, [US immigrant population has shrunk by 1.4 million](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/). Growing up as an immigrant child, this was always something that I saw first hand many times in both the Hispanic and Asian communities. When people were giving up on the American dream, they would often live to their fullest applying for and maxing out as many credit cards as possible, often sending money and gifts back to their home country before leaving.

Capital One (and their recently acquired Discover) is the industry leader in offering credit to people with bad to no credit history. Their application process is very easy and often no question asked where you just claim what your income is, and they'll approve you up to $2-3k per card. Applying for many credit card at once will often be a red flag, but usually the people who are doing this have already have been living in the U.S for a while with existing credit cards. Often they'll just apply for 3-4 more cards to max out before leaving, usually totaling to around $20-30k.

Their exposure to credit card loans has gone up significantly, over 60%, after merging with Discover, but meanwhile their consumer deposits have only increased about 30%. They are also calculating the new credit card loans acquired at a lower default rate, when in reality the allowance for bad debt should be much higher.

Meanwhile, their stock has gone up to record highs due to the seemingly increase in customer, more cards issued, and volume in transactions. When comparing to industry average, their stock price seems reasonable and correlate strongly to one another.  But in reality, COF is significantly worse than due to their high exposure to credit loans and significantly less deposits.

**CVNA (Carvana)**

While Carvana has been a long discussed stock here, and with significant amount of people getting burned trying to short this stock this year, I believe the financial pressure will finally be catching up to them.

The first half of this year, Carvana benefitted significantly from Trump's tariff war as people chose to buy cheaper second hand cars as opposed to the higher tariffed costs of new cars.  However, in the second half of next year, I believe this will change as well.

First reason being the immigration issue I previously discussed. Immigrants are often the main purchasers of use cars. Carvana does not care if you are an ""illegal"" immigrant, they will sell you a car regardless. These cars are often sold to them with high interest, financed by Carvana themselves, making their business model seem highly profitable. But these cars are often used for high mileage purposes like delivery services, often depreciating the vehicles much faster than Carvana expects. With significantly lower demand, higher delinquency on payments that are backed by a vehicle significantly more worn than expected, and their ever growing inventory size, Carvana is a ready to explode.

Second reason for Carvana's downfall is lower interest rates (soon) and the deductions new vehicle gets under Trump's new tax code. Used vehicles are not eligible for interest deduction, and lower interest rates means people are more incentivized and more likely to qualify for new vehicles.

Lastly, Carvana's competition is not only CarMax. Car buying/selling has never been easier with sites like Kelly Blue Book. They link you to your local dealership, often times getting a much better value due to lower overhead costs these dealership faces. They've also announced heavy ad spending last earnings (seems desperate and goes against their cost cutting to manage profitability motto).

All in all, I believe they are facing much bigger headwinds than just cooking their books can put off.

First time really posting here, and honestly pretty new to options. Previously I gambled on INTC when new CEO fired a bunch of people and wrote down their asset value, I assume the overstated balance and obsolete assets would be written off ASAP after a new CEO so any further decline can be blamed on previous CEO, thus their balance sheet was actually understated if anything, and bought INTC 20 Jan26 calls when it was @ $19. Open to feedback and discussion, maybe I am just gambling, maybe its an investment.

1nij58k,wallstreetbets,PART 2: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY,"**PART 2: The Larry Ellison Play - Paramount Skydance ($PSKY)**

Well $PSKY has had an active week. A little faster than I had originally expected, but hopefully many of you were able to trail my initial position posted last week to make some money.

* [PART 1: The Larry Play - Paramount Skydance $PSKY ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nedg0a/the_larry_play_paramount_skydance_psky/)

**I figure with all the recent excitement this is grounds for a Part 2:**

1. **$WBD Deal**
   * PSKY is planning a majority-cash, Ellison-backed bid for ALL of Warner Bros Discovery. For those paying attention, WBD planned to spinoff its assets into two separate cos in 2026: one was to be studios and streaming, the other was going to be networks. There was undoubtedly going to be a bidding war for the streaming assets. By getting out ahead of the spinoff and buying the assets before the others could, Larry is boxing out the competition. We have no clue how this is going to be structured. We only know that it‚Äôs Larry-backed. That said, we can obviously expect a sweetheart deal for PSKY that totally de-risks any funding concerns.
2. **Oracle/TikTok**
   * CBS reported that Oracle is leading a consortium for TikTok‚Äôs US assets. If you think Larry‚Äôs not going to use this distribution channel to pump PSKY‚Äôs content library, you‚Äôve got your head in the sand. There are 170 million TikTok US users (NFLX has 90 million paid US Subscribers) and 40% of Zoomers‚Äô screentime is spent on TikTok. The conversion metrics could be huge here.
3. **Value Dispersion**
   * NFLX has a market cap of $500B. It lost like $25B in value after the PSKY/WBD deal was announced.
   * ¬†PSKY‚Äôs market cap is $20B. It gained only \~$4B in value since the announcement.
   * Even shitty HULU is valued at nearly $30B on Disney‚Äôs balance sheet.

**I‚Äôm no mathematician, but there seems to be a mismatch here. You can buy what may become the primary NFLX competitor for a fraction of the price.**



**TLDR:** $PSKY.... HIGHER.¬†

  
**Position**: December/Jan Calls (Supporting Image attached)

1nhwt53,wallstreetbets,Everyone Is Pricing a Rate Cut. I Think They're Wrong.,"Change my mind if you can, but the market has been predicting a rate cut for months upon months now since December of last year, all the while news on inflation has not dimmed and JPOW still has tariff concerns.

Now, I understand unemployment numbers and the job report is looking sketchy, but let's be honest here. There needs to be 7/12 governors to vote for a cut. You tell me, considering only 2/12 voted for a cut last time, how they get the other 5 votes when the current board is neither hawkish nor dovish, but pragmatic.

I think JPOW is still hesitant on cuts, and will wait for October.

Disclaimer: I have 4,000 contracts on Robinhood Predictive Markets for the Fed maintaining rates. Proof from earlier post: (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1nh3kz8/prediction_markets_bet_jpow_will_maintain_rates/)

EDIT: To those of you downvoting my post and comments, I completely understand that you're scared this post may be the truth and that JPOW may very well just cook all your calls. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

EDIT 2: Some have brought it to my attention a possibility. What if JPOW's ""change of strategy"" is about a rate hike? So I went out of my way to bet $25 (832 contracts) of a .25 Rate Increase.

if demand is truly about to ‚Äúdouble,‚Äù why would the biggest ai chip supplier on the planet be guaranteeing empty racks?

answer: current demand is uneven. frontier labs (openai, meta, etc) are burning compute, but enterprise adoption is way slower. workloads are lumpy. nvidia is hedging against slowdown *right now*.

1niyk3r,investing,"IONQ and other Quantum stocks are rising insanely, is it worth to invest?","I noticed IONQ's presentation on investors' day, and they shared some information about achieving targets, and also had one slide where they presented the revenue, which is doubling every year. But if you look at the expenses, they are much more than the revenue they are generating. I understand it is a growth company, but I am not sure of the complete technology. So, I am trying to get some insights and want to check if you guys are aware or have any idea what they are talking about. Similarly, I noticed RGTI, QUBT, and QBTS are all going up.

|Period|Revenue|Operating Cash Flow (or Cash Flow from Operating Activities)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Q2 2025 (quarter ended June 30, 2025)**|**US$20.7 million**|**US$-85.6 million**|

|**Full Year 2024**|**US$43.07 million**|**‚àí US$105.68 million** approximately   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2023**|**US$22.04 million**|**US$-78.81 million**\~   operating cash flow|
|**Full Year 2022**|**US$11.13 million**|**US$-44.70 million**\~   operating cash flow|

I understand NVDA has gone through the same cycle at one point, but as Jensen mentioned, he was just lucky that AI happened and GPUs were useful. I am not sure if Quantum is anywhere near. It takes more than 3 years as IONQ has presented to commercialize, and I'm not sure if there is an actual application that can leverage the technology fully.

Thanks for your valuable feedback.

Updated: IonQ reported a net loss of $177.5 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million.

With all the acquisitions and compensation to more leadership teams, losses are expected to increase to $ 250 million per quarter.

To acquire Oxford Ionic, IONQ paid $1.065 billion in IONQ common stock and $10 million in cash. So, basically, the stockholders have already been diluted.

1njds9u,investing,Hedged EUR ETFs performance difference vs non-hedged,"Hi everyone, 

I'm still learning about investing and wanted to ask for your help to understand why, despite the EUR hedging, the Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF EUR Hdg Acc saw 1.68pp lower return YTD, when compared to Invesco S&P 500 UCITS ETF Acc. I understand that there is a higher TER to account for the cost of the swaps but the difference feels excessive.

Thank you.

1njdniq,investing,Bubble worries have sparked my interest in a particular bond ETF,"I do not believe in timing the market, but when there are major economic trends brewing, I do try to position myself to take advantage of them, which is why I'm plowing a big chunk of my portfolio into TLT right now.

TLT is an ETF for 20+ year bonds. It has a decent yield, but more importantly, it is very sensitive to interest rate changes. The moves can be pretty dramatic. It's down about 50% since the days of ZIRP. You don't usually think about capital gains when investing in bonds, but TLT is uniquely positioned for gains if the Fed continues to reduce rates.

My thesis for this investment is that we are either stuck in stagflation or we are on the verge of a recession. If we're in stagflation, the yield from TLT will outperform the S&P 500. If we're in a recession, the fed will likely continue to lower interest rates, and TLT will deliver capital gains on top of a yield.

The obvious risk is that we are actually entering a period of sticky inflation and the job market recovers, in which case the Fed will raise interest rates. But this seems like the least likely scenario. Tariffs are expected to create transitory inflation and everywhere you turn there is weak jobs data.

Unless you think I'm underestimating the risk of sticky inflation?",0,8,2025-09-17 21:48:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1njdniq/bubble_worries_have_sparked_my_interest_in_a/,2025-09-17 23:25:46.367522

1nj9zwu,investing,How do we feel about ACHR,"Archer Aviation is down about 35% from its highs earlier this year

I‚Äôve been following ACHR for almost a year, but I haven‚Äôt added more shares recently because the stock seems a bit volatile despite all the developments.

I‚Äôve done a lot of DD on them and I like their tech and long term vision, but some circumstances have changed over the past few months that make me cautious.

They‚Äôre making moves into the defense and military space, with partnerships like Anduril, trademarks like Monarch, Giraffa, and Mothra & property acquisitions near defense partners. They‚Äôre also set for upcoming events like the Dubai AirShow and potential operations in Abu Dhabi. These moves could create serious upside if executed well

https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/archer-aviation-inc-achr-a-bull-case-theory-4-1606309/

The main issues are that they‚Äôve missed earnings ($0.36 loss vs expected $0.24), and insiders have been selling significant shares recently. That always raises a red flag, even if it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker.

The stock‚Äôs trajectory is still promising, but progress has been slower than some expected. Their tech is solid, and the military angle could be a game-changer, but execution risk is real and timelines aren‚Äôt guaranteed.

SP has now reached levels where some long-term investors might start considering adding again, but I‚Äôm still on the sidelines.

1ni0ifz,investing,I just had a fascinating conversation about US exceptionalism vis a vis our shift to 401k versus pensions,"This is going to be long and only for the hardcore investment nerds I think. I asked a question, namely, ""does the consistent, robotic, unemotional influx of money from US retirement investors (buying pressure) have a stabilizing effect on the US market and does it contribute to US exceptionalism. The answer is a resounding ""yes"" it would seem. 

1. The US market holds the largest share of investors on the planet. Over 50% of the entire globe's investors are US investors, representing trillions of dollars.

2. As a result, these steady, cyclical drips into the US markets (home bias: most US investors invest in US companies) provide a stabilizing effect on domestic stocks. Even in down markets, there is a constant drip-feed of millions buying stocks undriven by emotion. 

3. This constant, drip-fed influx of money (regardless of market conditions) provides US companies with an advantage in the form of cheap capital, that is then used for R&D, only further ensuring that US products and companies recieve the highest level of innovation

4. This entire dynamic contributes to a de facto ""moat"" around the US market allowing to better weather troughs in the economic cycle, and maintain an innovation advantage over international competitors, increasing US market performance. 

It made me realize that because of our shift from defined pensions (in the 80s) to defined contributions in individual stock portfolios was a ""happy accident"" of sorts when the first 401k was dreamt up in 1979. By adopting the 401k (or similar) as the de facto retirement vehicle for people, we also managed to create a ""self feeding beast"" of sorts in the US market. This machine-like drip feed of funds is a major factor in what we call US exceptionalism, and it more than likely will help perpetuate it going forward.

Those of you not familiar with this promo, just take a look at r/jetblue among other flyer forums and you will be surprised how many people are doing it. The gist of the promo is that you fly to 25 destinations by the end of the year and you get x amount of their mileage points and a status with them for next 25 years. Directly, B6 may lose some money on these flyers (the points one earns roughly offset the amount one spends to acquire them). But imagine this. A person who is sitting on these points, and has a status with the airline, is going to do anything in his/her power to fly with them... for next 25 years. Not just them, their companions who may or may not have the status will likely fly with them too. So, I think it may be the thing that helps JetBlue survive. Third and fourth quarter earnings will give us some data to prove/disprove this theory. Thoughts?

Bryce C. Tingle, business law prof at U. of Calgary, writes;

> Over the past 30 years, the number of companies that sell shares on markets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq has fallen by roughly 50 percent.  ... I have spent more than a decade trying to understand what is going on, and I have come to believe that the culprit is public company governance, the system in which many different groups, all pursuing their own agendas, generate rules for how public companies ought to be managed. These rules, norms and regulations ‚Äî which tackle such issues as who gets to be a director, how executives should be paid, in what ways companies ought to respond to climate change ‚Äî are constantly accruing and building on one another until this obscure process generates towering structures that, like a great coral reef, can tear out the bottom of a boat. 

> From 2000 to 2020, only about 10 percent of a thousand successful venture-capital-backed companies chose to go public.

Does this mean that regular investors are fighting for the scraps, leading to a bubble in the highly valued tech stocks that are publicly traded?

Google AI tells me that US private companies are worth $14T, vs $63T public market cap.  But if this $14T is concentrated in novel tech, it's significant.  On the other hand,  most private cap companies are small.  On the third hand, it's likely comparatively little value resides in the long tail of small companies, just like the SP500.   For example, Anthropic is estimated to be worth $180B, and that's from a funding round, which I would think prices it conservatively.


Counterargument: if there's a bubble in AI and other tech, and you have a successful private company, it makes sense to go public and exploit that bubble by selling shares to a starving market.  Then again, it might make more sense to sell it when it's bigger, so the little guys don't get the benefit of the first phases of expansion.",73,33,2025-09-16 02:24:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1nhtsh0/nyt_fewer_companies_going_public_because_of/,2025-09-17 23:25:46.368523

How the hell is this legal? I get that there are supposed to be ‚Äúwalls‚Äù between departments to prevent collusion, but this all feels way too convenient.  Lost a decent chunk of my portfolio due to this whole debacle and if I wasn‚Äôt a poor student, I would be trying to talk to a lawyer instead by now.

1nhy2zb,investing,Arguments for and against international diversification,"I am currently in the process of reweighting and simplifying my portfolio. Around 85% of my holdings are in the USA, with 15% in developed international.

As of late, I have been considering reweighting this and potentially adding in emerging market exposure.

The US has outperformed international for some time now. I can see some reasons to believe that American Exceptionalism could continue.

1. Many American brands have a very high prestige around the world and can eat into international market share
2. Some American companies have a technological edge which will attract business from around the globe
3. The US has a very business-friendly climate and regulatory structure.
4. I see storm clouds on the horizon for many developed international markets, namely the birth rate crisis, sovereign debt issues, and business-hostile climate. Emerging markets similarly have their own problems, namely political risk, and environmental/climate issues.

However I can also see some basic arguments in favor of diversification:

1. Sure the US has outperformed in recent memory but that may be all the more reason for international stocks with more reasonable P/E ratios to outperform, moving forward.
2. The de-dollarization process has begun. [Foreign central banks now hold more Gold reserves than Treasuries for the first time in 30 years](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzrOr3jXEAA7pGm?format=jpg&name=medium) and the USA more generally is exhibiting signs of emerging market behavior. Rising populism from both parties, the erosion of Federal Reserve independence, a new push for more direct federal government management of the economy (tariffs, Intel, etc.), and the potential of monetizing the national debt all introduce a new set of risks and challenges for the US market.
3. Even with immigration, the US is not immune to the demographic problems plaguing the rest of the developed world. US deaths are expected to outpace births by 2031. Emerging markets have growing populations who are becoming educated and plugged into the internet at a breakneck pace.

After earnings, it Vital climbed to $50 and Google was at 200. Earnings came and went, and they didn't make that trade! Vital Farms is pretty much flat or lower now.

1nid949,investing,"AI Enthusiasm in Stocks: Records Despite Yields,Your Offset Pains?","The recent rise in AI stocks, which has reached record highs, feels like a real struggle. On one side, there's great excitement for AI that drives company values up. It resembles a gold rush, as everyone believes they've discovered the next big thing. At the same time, bond yields are rising, which typically makes investors more careful and can cause them to withdraw money from the stock market. This creates a strange mix of optimism and caution.

This situation raises the classic question: is this a true tech revolution or just a bubble waiting to burst? I find that the real challenge of holding these stocks is the wild fluctuations. One day you‚Äôre significantly up, and the next you‚Äôre down just as much. It's not suitable for the faint of heart.

To handle this kind of volatility, perhaps the strategy isn't to chase the latest trend but to think long-term and diversify. It might be better to find companies that genuinely use AI to address problems, rather than simply riding the hype.

1nj9v93,stocks,China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia‚Äôs AI chips,"     China‚Äôs internet regulator has banned the country‚Äôs biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia‚Äôs artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up efforts to boost its domestic industry and compete with the US.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) told companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia‚Äôs tailor-made product for the country, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.

Several companies had indicated they would order tens of thousands of the RTX Pro 6000D, and had started testing and verification work with Nvidia‚Äôs server suppliers, the people said.

After receiving the CAC order, the companies told their suppliers to stop the work, the people added.

The ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that focused on the H20, Nvidia‚Äôs other China-only chip widely used for AI. It comes after Chinese regulators concluded that domestic chips had attained performance comparable to those of Nvidia‚Äôs models used in China.

Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, told reporters in London on Wednesday that he expected to discuss the chipmaker‚Äôs ability to do business in China with Donald Trump that evening during the US president‚Äôs state visit to the UK.

‚ÄúWe can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I‚Äôm understanding of that. We are patient about it.‚Äù 

Beijing is putting pressure on Chinese tech companies to boost the country‚Äôs homegrown semiconductor industry and break their reliance on Nvidia so it can compete in an AI race against the US.

‚ÄúThe message is now loud and clear,‚Äù said an executive at one of the tech companies. ‚ÄúEarlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it‚Äôs all hands on deck to build the domestic system.‚Äù

Nvidia started producing chips tailored for the Chinese market after former US President Joe Biden banned the company from exporting its most powerful products to China, in an effort to rein in Beijing‚Äôs progress on AI.

Beijing‚Äôs regulators have recently summoned domestic chipmakers such as Huawei and Cambricon, as well as Alibaba and search engine giant Baidu, which also make their own semiconductors, to report how their products compare against Nvidia‚Äôs China chips, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

They concluded that China‚Äôs AI processors had reached a level comparable to or exceeding that of the Nvidia products allowed under export controls, the person added.

China says Nvidia violated antitrust law when it bought Mellanox

The Financial Times reported last month that China‚Äôs chipmakers were seeking to triple the country‚Äôs total output of AI processors next year.

‚ÄúThe top-level consensus now is there‚Äôs going to be enough domestic supply to meet demand without having to buy Nvidia chips,‚Äù said an industry insider.

Nvidia introduced the RTX Pro 6000D in July during Huang‚Äôs visit to Beijing, when the US company also said Washington was easing its previous ban on the H20 chip.

China‚Äôs regulators, including the CAC, have warned tech companies against buying Nvidia‚Äôs H20, asking them to justify having purchased them over domestic products, the FT reported last month.

The RTX Pro 6000D, which the company has said could be used in automated manufacturing, was the last product Nvidia was allowed to sell in China in significant volumes.

Alibaba, ByteDance, the CAC and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1nirgbf,stocks,Microsoft announces $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure in UK,"Microsoft¬†said on Tuesday that it plans to invest $30 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.K. by 2028.

The investment includes $15 billion in capital expenditures and $15 billion in its U.K. operations, Microsoft said. The company said the investment would enable it to build the U.K.‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest supercomputer,‚Äù with more than 23,000 advanced graphics processing units, in partnership with Nscale, a British cloud computing firm.

The spending commitment comes as¬†President Donald Trump¬†embarks on a state visit to Britain. Trump arrived in the U.K. Tuesday evening and is set to be greeted at Windsor Castle on Wednesday by King Charles and Queen Camilla.

During his visit, all eyes are on U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is under pressure to bring stability to the country after the exit of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a house tax scandal and a major cabinet reshuffle.

On a call with reporters on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said his stance on the U.K. has warmed over the years. He previously criticized the country over its¬†attempt in 2023 to block the tech giant‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of video game developer Activision-Blizzard. The deal was¬†cleared by the U.K.s competition regulator¬†later that year.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt always been optimistic every single day about the business climate in the U.K.,‚Äù Smith said. However, he added, ‚ÄúI am very encouraged by the steps that the government has taken over the last few years.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a few years ago, this kind of investment would have been inconceivable because of the regulatory climate then and because there just wasn‚Äôt the need or demand for this kind of large AI investment,‚Äù Smith said.

Starmer and Trump are expected to sign a new deal Wednesday ‚Äúto unlock investment and collaboration in AI, Quantum, and Nuclear technologies,‚Äù the government said in a statement late Tuesday.

**Yields from Treasury bonds**¬†and other U.S. government securities are¬†**subject to Federal tax but exempt from state and local income taxes.**

**Here are some popular Bond ETFs:**

* **SCHO (Schwab Short-Term U.S. Treasury ETF):**¬†Invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 years. This provides the most safety and lowest interest rate risk of the group (except SGOV), but with a lower potential yield.¬†
* **IEF (iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF):**¬†Focuses on intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities between 7 and 10 years. It provides a middle ground between the low risk of short-term bonds and the high volatility of long-term bonds
* **TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF):**¬†Concentrates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities over 20 years. This gives it a high duration, meaning it is highly sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates.
* **GOVT (iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF):**¬†Provides exposure to the entire U.S. Treasury yield curve, from short- to long-term. Its blended maturity profile reduces volatility compared to a long-duration fund like TLT but also limits its upside if long rates fall.
* **GOVZ¬†(iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF):**¬†The most aggressive option, holding zero-coupon STRIPS. Its long duration makes it extremely sensitive to interest rate changes. It is a high-risk investment and not typically for investors seeking broad Treasury exposure.¬†

Yes, if you bought during or before 2021 you likely are still down. However, if you held your nose and bought when it was trading at dirt cheap prices during Feb 2024 you‚Äôre probably pretty happy right now.

The best time to buy is when everyone says ‚Äúthis is Uninvestable.‚Äù For example, I think stocks like MOH and CNC could have a lot of upside, maybe some REITs like ARE or MPW have value too.

""Miran told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee that he would act independently if confirmed, but he does not intend to resign from his current White House position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.

Instead, he would opt to take a leave of absence from the White House to serve on the central bank and then return after his term is up.""

1njfr5i,stocks,Uranium/Nuclear Equities irrationally sinking due to China 'ban' on NVIDIA's AI chips. The reality is uranium is in seriously short supply.,"Obviously this ban (actually the Chinese government telling Chinese companies to avoid NVIDIA's AI chips) is bringing down NVIDIA stocks today. But it looks like it is also affecting Uranium and Nuclear. Sprott and VanEck Uranium/Nuclear ETFs are down up to a half percent as I type this, for example. However, this ""instruction"" by the Chinese government *does not affect the building boom of data centres in the western world*. These data centres are still being built at a record pace in America and elsewhere.

Consider first that it is recognized that there is impending uranium shortage because of this data centre building boom and widely predicted energy shortage. There is simply not enough uranium being mined and processed today to keep up with a very real future demand.

And on top of this, there is a growing understanding that a more reliable and 'green' source of stable power is required for the next 50 years or so, until 'renewable' energy can do this. Currently green can definitely supply large amounts of power, but the stability at grid scale is still a work in progress.

Nuclear is in such high demand, that even retired nuclear generating stations are being refurbished and brought back online. And at least 5 countries in Europe are either extending the lives of current reactors, and/or are also building new ones.

Even Canada is upping its nuclear game. A sure sign that nuclear is winning, over purely wind and solar solutions. It is expanding its nuclear capacity. The Bruce Generating Station in Ontario has almost completed adding two new reactors, which will make it once again the largest nuclear generating station in the world. And Ontario's Darlington nuclear generating station (currently with 4 reactors) will be adding 4 new SMRs which was just announced by the PM. And Alberta is looking seriously at building a nuclear generating station. If Canada is doing this, nuclear is mainstream.

My crystal ball says uranium and nuclear will be in big demand for some time to come.",0,1,2025-09-17 23:08:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1njfr5i/uraniumnuclear_equities_irrationally_sinking_due/,2025-09-17 23:25:47.820610
1njffif,stocks,Bill Ackman Insurance acquisition TBA soon at 09/30 annual meeting?,"Previously Bill Ackman for HHH mentioned that he was looking to acquire a 1-3B+ insurance co following the model of Warren Buffett.¬†

It is expected that an announcement can happen at the annual meeting in a couple of weeks on Sep 30 or even announced earlier.

the reason why Warren outperforms the market & loves insurance, is because insurers reinvests their profits. For Warren & Geico, they rolled their profits & reinvest into equity, which allows them to make outsized returns. Bill Ackman wants to replicate this success.

Based on his vision, a P&C insurer is his most likely choice, as reserve requirements are low which allows for reinvestment and it also follows the Geico playbook pretty well.

LMND mcap is too high(4.2B), HIPO mcap is too small & unprofitable, ROOT makes sense(1.5B) but management has always mentioned that they wanted to grow ROOT to be larger than PGR, so that is likely out of the pic, as ROOT takes the solo approach.

I do not see Bill investing in health insurance due to his past criticism of UNH. Nor is he investing in life insurance due to the higher reserve requirements. Speciality insurance is also too niched with less TAM. Also many MGA's have terrible balance sheets with negative tangible equity (GSHD, RYAN, TWFG, etc)

1njednu,stocks,A deep dive into the autonomous robobus market: the renault-weride partnership,"I've been tracking the autonomous vehicle space like tesla to find a good point to sell it, and the news about weride caught my attention. their plan to launch a mass-produced robobus by 2030 for the european market seems like a big shift.

This partnership raises some interesting questions for me. for a while, the market's been obsessed with robotaxis, but the b2b robobus model seems more stable, with predictable, long-term revenue. how do we value a company focused on this niche, given that most of the public comps are in the robotaxi space?

The focus on meeting unified eu standards is also a crucial point. this could be a massive de-risking factor and a significant moat. it's a great example of regulatory arbitrage, and a company's ability to navigate these hurdles could be a huge long-term value driver. weride has global experience, including in strict markets like japan, which suggests they can clear these regulatory obstacles.

Finally, there's the ""nvidia effect"" weride is the only company in the autonomous driving field that nvidia has directly invested in. this partnership with renault provides a fundamental basis for a long-term investment thesis, moving it beyond a purely speculative ai play. I'm curious to hear other traders' thoughts on this. is the robobus market a more stable segment for autonomous driving? how do you factor in strategic partnerships and regulatory wins into your analysis?",2,0,2025-09-17 22:16:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1njednu/a_deep_dive_into_the_autonomous_robobus_market/,2025-09-17 23:25:47.820610

CEO Adam Goldstein called it a *‚Äúlandmark moment,‚Äù* while United‚Äôs CFO said flying taxis could reshape how people move through congested cities. The trials could start as early as next year, with data feeding into certification and future expansion.

1nhnjwm,stocks,Trump advocates end to quarterly earnings reports,"President¬†Donald Trump¬†floated the idea Monday of companies no longer providing earnings report on a quarterly basis and switching to semiannual instead.

In a¬†Truth Social post, Trump said the idea is ‚Äúsubject to SEC approval‚Äù and would ‚Äúsave money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever hear the statement that, ‚ÄòChina has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!‚Äô‚Äù Trump said.

The wisdom of quarterly reports has come under question before. In a 2018¬†op-ed piece¬†for The Wall Street Journal, Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs¬†Warren Buffett¬†and JPMorgan Chase CEO¬†Jamie Dimon¬†advocated doing away with quarterly guidance, though not earnings reports.

‚ÄúIn our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,‚Äù the pair wrote.

Current regulations require companies to report earnings on a quarterly basis, though providing forecasts is voluntary. The rules can be changed either from the Securities and Exchange Commission or could be altered by Congress.

Supporters of the current system say it provides investors with timely opportunity as well as transparency about public companies.

1nhmzq8,stocks,Alphabet becomes fourth company to reach $3 trillion market cap,"Alphabet has joined the $3 trillion club.

Shares of the search giant jumped more than 4% on Monday, pushing the company into territory occupied only by¬†Nvidia,¬†Microsoft¬†and¬†Apple.

The stock got a big lift in early September from an antitrust¬†ruling¬†by a judge, whose penalties came in lighter than shareholders feared. The U.S. Department of Justice wanted Google to be forced to divest its Chrome browser, and last year a district court ruled that the company held an illegal¬†monopoly in search¬†and related advertising.

But Judge¬†Amit Mehta¬†decided against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, which sent shares soaring to a record. After the big rally, President¬†Donald Trump¬†congratulated the company and¬†called¬†it ‚Äúa very good day.‚Äù

Alphabet shares are now up more than 30% this year, compared to the 15% gain for the Nasdaq.

The $3 trillion milestone comes roughly 20 years after Google‚Äôs IPO and a little more than 10 years after of the¬†creation¬†of Alphabet as a holding company, with Google its prime subsidiary. .

CEO Sundar Pichai was¬†named CEO¬†of Alphabet in 2019, replacing co-founder Larry Page. Pichai‚Äôs latest challenge has been the surge of new competition due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which the company has had to manage through while also fending off an aggressive set of regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

The rise of Perplexity and OpenAI ended up¬†helping¬†Google land the recent favorable antitrust ruling. The company‚Äôs hopes of becoming a major AI player largely ride with Gemini, Google‚Äôs flagship suite of AI models.

As for me, I've began my investing journey around 3 years ago and adopted a relatively conservative approach. By this I mean I hold around

* 30% cash in high-yield accounts (3-4%)
* 20% in a retirement account (6%)
* roughly 50% in a mixture of ETFs, individual stocks and crypto. Breakdown would be:
   * 35% ETFs tracking S&P500
   * 13% individual stocks
   * 2% crypto

This entire breakdown is derived from my entire net worth, I'm debt-free and projecting retirement in my early 40s.

Now going back to my dad, we've had several conversations about stocks & investments over the years, many of which have raised strong questions from me over his investing style. Let me name a few to paint a better picture:

* He's taken a nearly $2-3 million dollar loan to invest into more stocks (paid back almost half the loan)
* Majority of his investments are individual stocks, many of which consists of penny/speculative stocks that have tanked -80% all the way to delisting.
   * Huge chunk in GoPro in 2015, still holding to today with massive losses and no plans to sell and reallocate
   * Another huge chunk in (actinium pharma), which tanked nearly 90% due to not receiving FDA approval
* Several huge investments in mutual funds with high management fees (1.5-2%) which are either loss-making and barely making meaningful returns.

I was able to get hold of his spreadsheet recently to properly review his financial situation and it's extremely alarming. From my analysis, he's holding:

* 70+ individual stocks, mostly losses
* 10+ mutual funds, mostly losses

Over the last 10 months, I've created and presented two separate presentations explaining the amount of risk he's taking. I've explained the urgency of trimming his portfolio massively and reallocating into a simple index funds / bonds and even blue-chip individual stocks instead of penny stocks.

However, he has massive sunk-cost fallacy and refuses to cut his positions. He wants to wait another 6 months despite having held some of these positions over a decade. This is despite me presenting the mathematical projections that he's almost guaranteed to continue incurring huge losses holding these duds over investing in safer assets.

Does anyone have advice? I'm appaled as to how bad the damage is and whether he'll be able to repay the loan given his age.

TLDR;

Dad lost most of retirement savings from risky assets, has a $1.6 million loan to repay.",233,235,2025-09-15 23:28:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhozun/how_do_i_27m_convince_my_dad_68m_to_stop_gambling/,2025-09-17 23:25:47.820610

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

A quick question: out of the Mag 7, which do you think have the largest and lowest downside potential in case AI does not turn out to be the goldmine many think/thought it could be?

There are increasing concerns around the current version of AI (LLMs) being limited and not able to reach AGI (see, for instance, Yann Lecun‚Äôs take on it), coupled with concerns around monetisation (or, at least, monetisation in a scale compatible with providing good returns on the huge capital being invested), hence my question.

I think Nvidia is the top loser in that scenario, and Tesla the least exposed. Not sure about the other ones.

Thank you!

P.S.: My current Mag7 top pick for the medium-long term is Alphabet.",89,82,2025-09-14 23:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngujqq/mag_7_exposure_to_ai_downside/,2025-09-17 23:25:47.820610
1nhof8h,stocks,"LENZ Therapeutics - A high risk, high reward biotech stock","Hello r/stocks I have a small cap company I want to share. Firstly I want you all to be aware of the risks associated with small caps. Mainly low volume and low liquidity leading to larger spreads on the bid/ask. Along with if the float is small then it is possibly easier for bigger players to manipulate price action. Okay great now that we got that out of the way allow me to introduce LENZ Therapeutics.

‚∏ª

LENZ Therapeutics: A Biotech company with a singular product that was recently approved by the FDA, has plans to go live with distribution in October of 2025. What is their singular product you ask? It is called VIZZ and FDA Approved Aceclidine 1.44% eye drop to treat Presbyopia.

Right now you might be thinking ‚ÄúWhat did I just read?‚Äù I was just like you when I first read that. Here is what I learned.

Presbyopia ‚Äì More commonly known as farsightedness, affects 128 million adults in the US. Farsightedness means you cannot read up close, a very intuitive way the medical community decided to define that, Thanks Docs!

‚∏ª

What does this mean?

Well, VIZZ can treat farsightedness with an eye drop that lasts up to 10 hours. This will remove the need for reader glasses for example, it will be beneficial for people that need an ability to focus their eyesight more on things up close: computer screens, phone screens, reading, and many more activities requiring the ability to focus on things close to you.

‚∏ª

My thesis is based around the potential growth this company could achieve by successfully integrating the product into the market. They currently have one competitor Vuity. Their competitor‚Äôs efficacy and side effects however are worse all around. This product uses a more effective active ingredient. People also like to take the easy way out often times, and an eye drop that will make it so they don‚Äôt have to remember bringing their glasses everywhere is the perfect level of convenience for people.

‚∏ª

Possible Growth:

	‚Ä¢Pricing is believed to be $80 a month

	‚Ä¢Target population of the US is 128 million people

	‚Ä¢A 4% adoption rate would mean an estimated gross revenue of 5 billion dollars for a single year

	‚Ä¢The stock price at that level of revenue could be anywhere from $400 to $600

‚∏ª

Company Financial Health: Good

	‚Ä¢Short Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $10 million in liabilities

	‚Ä¢Long Term Liabilities covered at $213 million in assets / $600k in liabilities

	‚Ä¢This puts them at low risk of needing to liquidate shareholder currently

‚∏ª

So we have a lot of potential here but let‚Äôs not forget the risks because we have a lot of them to consider

‚∏ª

Major Risks to Consider:

	‚Ä¢They currently only have one product so success or failure weighs heavily on its shoulders

	‚Ä¢They have a competitor (albeit inferior) in the market

	‚Ä¢I am unable to determine if their creation of this drug is protected by some type of IP or patent

	‚Ä¢It is currently a small cap company and at risk of what I mentioned in the opening of the post due to that

	‚Ä¢The drug was blind tested for 3 years, there could be longer term side effects that would negatively hurt public opinion

	‚Ä¢Financial health could be pressured if they fail to scale in an economical way

	‚Ä¢Short Interest is 30% ‚Äì it is irrelevant to my thesis on this product but something you should all be aware of

‚∏ª

I personally think the risk is worth the reward here. Would love to discuss what you all think and if we have any biotech investment experts I definitely want your take on the matter.

1nhxe5d,stocks,EchoStar (SATS) seems massively undervalued after the $17B SpaceX deal,"I look at EchoStar (SATS), and I see something very interesting. A big thing happened and I think many people do not see the real story. I think maybe the price is too low now.

So, this company had a very big problem. It had too much debt. Like a huge credit card bill that is hard to pay. But then, they sell something very valuable. They sell their invisible highways for phone signals, what people call spectrum. First, they sell some to AT&T for $23 billion. Then, they sell more to SpaceX, the Elon Musk company, for $17 billion. That is so much money. With this money, they can pay all the debt. The big problem is gone.

The deal with SpaceX is very special. EchoStar did not just get cash. They get $8.5 billion in cash, and also an $8.5 billion piece of the SpaceX company. So now, EchoStar owns a part of SpaceX. This is very exciting, because SpaceX is growing very fast with its Starlink internet from satellites.
So what is EchoStar company now? It is not the same company it was before. Before, they were trying to build a big new 5G phone network all by themselves. This was very risky and was costing so much money. Now, they stopped that plan. The company is now more simple. It is a company that just owns a few other businesses. It is much safer now.

Think of it like a box with different toys inside. What is in the box?

First, there is the TV business, with DISH and Sling. This part is getting smaller, but it still makes a lot of money, like a cash machine.

Second, the phone business, Boost Mobile. It is smaller now and will use towers from other companies. But it will have a special new power: it will use the Starlink satellites from SpaceX so customers can get signal even in the middle of nowhere.

Third, an internet business called Hughes. This part is very stable and sells internet to government and other big companies.

Fourth, the piece of SpaceX. This is the most exciting part. It is like having a ticket for a rocket ship that is already flying to the moon. SpaceX is worth so much money, maybe $400 billion or more.

And fifth, they still have more of those invisible phone highways left to sell! One big bank said this extra part could be worth almost $10 billion. They can sell this later to a company like Verizon and get even more cash.

So, I add up all these pieces. The TV business, the phone business, the internet business, the piece of SpaceX, and the extra highways they still own. When I add it all up, I think the company is worth about $32 billion. But if you look at the stock market, the price for the whole company is only about $22 billion. This is a very big difference. It means one share of the stock could be worth maybe $110, but today it is much cheaper.

The story is simple. The company had a big debt problem. They sold some things and now the problem is gone. Now they have no debt, they have businesses that make money, and they own a piece of one of the world's most exciting companies. But the stock price is still acting like the old company with the big problem. This is why I think it is very interesting.

This is just my idea, of course, not advice. I am very interested to hear what you think. Am I missing something? Let me know your thoughts and if you see any mistakes in my thinking.",0,23,2025-09-16 04:36:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nhxe5d/echostar_sats_seems_massively_undervalued_after/,2025-09-17 23:25:47.820610

1ngorsm,stocks,Duolingo valuation.,"Seems like great company. Amazing growth. Has pulled back 50 percent and now retracing a bit. 

I circled back to this. How do you get comfortable with valuation even after the drop ?  Analysts have like 8 $ in eps in 29. So 40x pe or 10x projected 2 billion revenue is nearly any upside. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something?  Unless you think they can crush estimates and become the learning super app. Capturing massive tam. Might be too hard for me on Surface. They do have impressive rule of 40 and gross margins. Has a starter stake up 15 percent",42,52,2025-09-14 19:23:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ngorsm/duolingo_valuation/,2025-09-17 23:25:47.820610
1ngcw5o,stocks,How is this possible?,"So, draftkings and fanduel have BOTH found a way to not turn a profit on a sports book. I understand it's more complex than that, but cmon. They both are probably unable to offload action,  but the players prepay. No risk on collecting either. That leaves 2 companies inept at keeping enough lines right to profit on the spread, and even worse with parlays. Books don't go broke on parlays. That shouldn't happen. Fanduel has multiple TV channels 24/7. Not sure about draftkings. I know money has been leaving the stock since June. 

Can someone explain how something legal in person in Vegas is profitable, but not online. Is the business model just a bust due to ungodly liquidity required, or would expected rate cuts through the end of the year change the direction?

1maxpqx,SecurityAnalysis,LandBridge ($LB) short report: Stress testing Gotham City Research‚Äôs claims,"I‚Äôm seeing plenty of aggregator blurbs and quick takes on X, but almost zero rigorous discussion of Gotham City Research‚Äôs 7/24/25 short report on LandBridge ($LB). 

PDF link here (original source): https://www.gothamcityresearch.com/landbridge-report

Here‚Äôs my summary of their thesis: 
1. Up to 55% of FY24 revenue could be ‚Äúcircular‚Äù via related-party WaterBridge/Powered Land deals.
2. $8M data-center deposit allegedly booked as revenue in violation of GAAP principles. Powered Land was incorporated the same day the lease was announced but little public disclosure about the company. 
3. Produced-water royalties over 2x that of TPL‚Äôs, which Gotham argues the pricing isn‚Äôt sustainable.
4. Deloitte audited the financials, but LB used lax Emerging-Growth-Company requirements as loophole to skip an internal-controls audit.
5. Mixed audit-committee track record: two directors previously served on boards that later restated financials. Previous CFO had abruptly left the company following the IPO and there‚Äôs still no public info explaining why. 
6. Texas RRC wastewater-disposal rules effective June 2025 could lift disposal costs 20-30% and squeeze LB‚Äôs water-royalty economics.
7. Texas Supreme Court‚Äôs June 2025 ‚ÄúCactus Water‚Äù ruling clarifies produced-water ownership in favor of mineral lessees, potentially undermining LB‚Äôs pricing power.
8. If closed-loop cooling / water-recycling tech scales, brackish-water demand (and thus LB‚Äôs surface royalties) could fall. This risk was barely mentioned in the S-1.

Thus far, I have only seen superficial reactions online to what promoters say is a ‚Äúbogus report‚Äù from a biased firm looking to cover their short position. While I think the framing of some points are skewed (e.g., one of the two audit members had been brought in to help clean up an embattled company‚Äôs financials, which is arguably a positive attribute), I think some of these serious issues have merit.

What are others‚Äô thoughts?

1m55ghq,SecurityAnalysis,Salmon industry analysis,"Hi   
I've been posting free articles of my own on this sub for quite some time. I believe that they provide good value to members of the sub, but some members have complained that it is not fair to simply post the links, because it is self-promotion, and because after two weeks, the articles go paywalled. Following the suggestion by u/ebisure I'm posting a small summary here, so that at least part of the content remains on the sub, and to make discussion easier. 

  
Salmon is one of the most interesting commodity industries. 

It is a commodity, it has cycles, but it also enjoys rents that are generated by environmental and regulatory constraints to supply expansion. This makes some of the companies in the industry very profitable across the cycle, particularly the Northern European ones like Mowi, Salmar, Leroy, and Bakkafrost. The revenues and margins of these companies do cycle, but at all points in the cycle, their profitability remains elevated. 

The salmon market is currently undergoing a down portion of its cycle, since at least 2021/22. The main driver, in my opinion, has been less aggressive demand, which has not bid up prices as much as during post-COVID. Supply has been very restrained, not growing in the aggregate since 2021. 

However, this year and in 2026, supply is probably going to increase significantly, probably leading to an accentuation of the lower margin situation. I hope this is the case, because at that point, the major companies, which I consider top-quality producers, might trade at attractive valuations. 

Currently, I believe that these companies can grow at 8% across the cycle, and can offer an FCF yield of about 3%, or a 10/11% return over time. I don't think this is particularly attractive, but rather fair. That's why I hope a more challenging 2025/26 season leads to lower stock prices. 

In the long term, the industry is threatened by the (still nascent) effort to cultivate salmon on land-based facilities that eliminate the natural constraints to supply expansion, and therefore lead to a completely different industry. Some people believe land-based will never be competitive, or only with a low probability, while others believe it is almost certain that at some point land-based production will be competitive. I'm somewhere in between, although without enough technical knowledge to judge this correctly.

1lw80nl,SecurityAnalysis,UPDATE: FONAR (FONR) receives Management Buyout Offer,"I have analyzed [FONAR Corp. (FONR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FONR/) on this subreddit [about two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/10j8xdh/fonar_corp_fonr_unlocking_hidden_value_in_a/), you can find the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/10j8xdh/fonar_corp_fonr_unlocking_hidden_value_in_a/). In the past two years, not too much has happened, but FONAR has been increasing their net tangible book value quarter after quarter after quarter. 

Yesterday, however, there were some rather big news. [The company has received a Non-Binding ""Take Private"" proposal](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fonar-board-directors-announces-receipt-210200570.html). The proposal is from their CEO (the son of the founder) and some members of the management team and their Board of Directors (let's call this group the potential buyers). I think their offer is way too low (they are offering at least a 10% premium to the 90 day average before July 1st, when their stock was trading at very low prices, so roughly $15.00). The potential buyers only own 5.01% of the outstanding stock, they will have some convincing to do - and if you ask me, that convincing could be best done by offering a fair price, which has to be at least net book value (which [was at $25.98 last quarter](https://www.fonar.com/news/05152025.html)), or actually even quite a bit more than that.

This situation is looking somewhat similar to [Willis Lease Finance Corporation (WLFC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WLFC/), where the founders have been trying to take the company private for years, usually offering too low prices. WLFC's stock price went from $50 to above $200 in the process (now back to a bit lower again).

This is certainly going to become quite interesting.",7,1,2025-07-10 17:06:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/1lw80nl/update_fonar_fonr_receives_management_buyout_offer/,2025-09-17 23:25:48.827033

1lrf1df,SecurityAnalysis,Possible bargain?,"Hey guys, I wanna ask for your opinon about [1502.HK](http://1502.HK) (Financial Street Property). It's a Chinese company listed in Hong Kong that provides property management services. It holds minimal properties itself. What caught my eye is that it was ""punished"" alongside other real estate related companies in China due to property crisis there without being fundamentally affected itself. The stock price has fallen over 90% from all-time highs, whereas revenues have been only increasing (average revenue growth of about 11-12% per year over the past 5 years), it has been paying dividends for several years nontsop (current yield at around 7-8%), it holds much more cash than total liabilities (around 1580 m in cash and equivalents vs 960 m in total liabilities) , and it is selling at a Graham-style below liquid asset value. In fact, it is selling even at a negative EV. If you dig deeper into its sources of income, its business is expanding as properties it is managing are increasing. What do you think guys? I'm relatively new to this, I'm not sure if I found a bargain gem or a value trap. I would be grateful for any insights.

1lbd0k4,SecurityAnalysis,2 investment ideas from Columbia Business School‚Äôs Analyst‚Äôs Edge (Fall 2024),"Today, I‚Äôm returning to Columbia Business School (CBS) once again to explore a third source of ideas: the latest student investment theses from¬†*The Analyst‚Äôs Edge ‚Äî Fall 2024 edition.*

  
The Analyst‚Äôs Edge is an application-only course at CBSwhere 8 to 10 students each year learn what it takes to become world-class investors. Each student writes a full investment thesis on a stock of their choice ‚Äî often actionable, deeply researched, and grounded in the Graham & Dodd investing tradition that has long shaped Columbia‚Äôs value investing culture.

In this post, I‚Äôll share what I found after reading this latest batch of theses. The ideas range from global compounders to special situation plays ‚Äî all written with the disciplined lens of fundamental investors.



# MercadoLibre (MELI)

*Recommendation: Long*

*Analyst: Chris Zeng*

The thesis on MELI highlights the company‚Äôs position as the dominant e-commerce and fintech platform in Latin America, with a powerful ecosystem and long runway for growth. The analyst argues that MELI will continue to benefit from secular trends driving digital adoption across the region, while its unique integrated model ‚Äî combining marketplace, payments (Mercado Pago), credit, logistics, and other services ‚Äî deepens its competitive moat.

MELI holds the #1 market share in Latin America for e-commerce, with significant advantages in logistics, brand trust, and scale. The e-commerce market in LatAm remains underpenetrated, with strong growth ahead: only \~56% of adults shop online today, and per-capita spending is expected to grow at a 21% CAGR.

The fintech segment, Mercado Pago, is an even larger opportunity, with total retail payment volume in LatAm estimated at $2.35 trillion. Mercado Pago is growing off-platform payment volume faster than on-platform, and is helping drive financial inclusion in a region with low credit card penetration. MELI‚Äôs credit business leverages proprietary data from the marketplace and payment platforms to manage risk better than traditional banks.

**Key drivers**¬†include MELI‚Äôs flywheel effects ‚Äî the integration of marketplace activity, logistics (Mercado Envios), and payments creates increasing user stickiness. Logistics is a strong moat: MELI operates the fastest and most reliable delivery network in the region, outperforming Amazon and newer entrants. Other potential growth drivers include insurance (leveraging marketplace data for targeted offerings) and Q-commerce (quick delivery services).

**Risks**¬†include near-term margin pressure from logistics investments, credit card expansion (especially in Mexico), and rising competition from Amazon, Shopee, and emerging players like Temu and Shein. However, the analyst argues that recent margin compression is a moat-widening investment and that MELI‚Äôs network effects, brand, and data advantages will help it maintain leadership.

**Valuation is attractive:**¬†MELI trades at 4x EV/NTM Sales, well below historical levels (it traded at 19x at the 2021 peak), while still growing revenues at \~40% YoY. The thesis expects further margin improvement and operating leverage as the business scales, and sees MELI as a long-term compounder and a key proxy for LatAm‚Äôs accelerating digital economy.  


# Tesla (TSLA)

*Recommendation: Long*

*Analyst: Landon Clay*

The market is significantly underestimating the long-term impact of autonomous driving (Full Self-Driving / FSD), the explosive potential of energy storage, and the optionality embedded in Tesla‚Äôs broader innovation pipeline (including the Optimus humanoid robot). Landon forecasts a 73% probability-weighted upside based on 6-year projections, with potential to 5x 2023 EBIT by 2030.

Tesla is positioned not simply as an EV manufacturer but as a vertically integrated tech ecosystem, with competitive advantages in data, manufacturing, and AI. Its massive fleet of \~7 million cars acts as a global data collection engine for training FSD. This dataset gives Tesla an edge over competitors relying on LIDAR and HD maps. The upcoming FSD Version 13 is expected to drive higher adoption (currently sub-10%), with robotaxi ambitions potentially unlocking massive new revenue streams.

The company‚Äôs energy storage business ‚Äî currently growing at \~26% QoQ CAGR ‚Äî is emerging as a second core business. Tesla already holds 20% GWh market share, and Bloomberg projects 30x growth in global energy storage by 2035. With its Shanghai Megafactory and U.S. capacity expansion, Tesla is positioned to be a top player in this market, generating high-margin recurring revenue.

The Optimus robot is a long-dated call option. While speculative, Landon notes that success here could create trillions in market value. Tesla‚Äôs AI training stack and proprietary manufacturing give it a credible path to lead in this space ‚Äî though realization is likely 5‚Äì10 years out.

On the core EV business, TSLA remains the global leader in production efficiency, battery technology, and brand loyalty. The shift to the new ‚Äúunboxed‚Äù production process could increase manufacturing efficiency by 40%, enabling margin expansion even as ASPs decline. The U.S. market still has significant room to grow EV penetration (currently \~10% of new sales), and FSD success could further accelerate demand.

**Key risks**¬†include failure of FSD to reach full autonomy, key-man risk around Elon Musk, geopolitical or commodity price shocks, and potential regulatory hurdles. However, the thesis argues that Tesla‚Äôs innovation-driven culture, scale advantages, and multi-business model flywheel give it asymmetric upside compared to traditional auto peers.

At¬†**current valuation**¬†(with EV/EBIT multiples expected to compress from \~116x to \~75x), the analyst sees significant room for Tesla to compound value across its automotive, energy, and AI segments over the next decade.
