¿Por Qué MAGA?,"¿Por Qué MAGA?

Progressives will only make lasting progress with Latino voters if they examine not just why Trump was appealing, but also why the left was not.

The rightward drift of Latinos—especially Latino men—in the 2024 presidential election shocked the political establishment. According to NBC News exit polls, 54 percent of Latino men and 39 percent of Latina women voted for Donald Trump, enough to toss a bomb into the dreams of a come-from-behind Democratic victory. It was bewildering to many: wasn’t Trump a xenophobe who delighted in separating families, disparaging diversity, and cutting social spending? But it should not have been a surprise.

After all, there was already a slight conservative tilt in the Latino vote back in 2020, but it was dismissed by some political consultants. Meanwhile, anyone with an ear to the ground through the summer of 2024 was hearing grumbles from both U.S.-born and long-term-resident immigrant Latinos who wondered why the new wave of migrants in 2022 and 2023 was getting “special” support, including temporary housing assistance upon arrival and work permits for those applying for asylum.

This surprising (to some) anti-immigrant impulse emerged on top of the unease triggered by an economy that seemed both too anemic and too expensive. Latino voters are overwhelmingly working class, and thus especially sensitive to the ravages of inflation. Their class orientation is also complex, shaped less by resentment of the rich than by a sense that work should be rewarded. As such, Trump’s status as a successful businessman—or at least the fact that he played one on TV—is not necessarily a turn-off for Hispanic voters who dream of starting their own small businesses.

The Latino red tide was, of course, greeted with glee by MAGA forces: finally, a breakthrough to the country’s largest and still growing minority group, one that could drive a permanent realignment of an increasingly multicultural working class behind conservative or at least Trumpian principles. By contrast, the results brought chagrin to progressive forces who had long viewed (and misconstrued) the “Latinx” population through exactly the distant ideological prism that led them to adopt the word “Latinx,” a term that in 2023 was used by only 4 percent of the population in question (with 75 percent of those who had actually heard the term saying it should not be used).

Meanwhile, some Black analysts and political figures lamented the defeat of a Black woman at the hands and ballots of brown men. Steve Phillips’s optimistic analysis in Brown Is the New White had conceived of an emerging rainbow coalition of people of color joined with progressive whites for a new American majority. But apparently brown had instead drifted to the old white—and some Black Americans felt that Trump’s promised (and now ongoing) reign of terror against immigrants was just desserts for a group gone bad.

What Went Wrong?

To even ask what went wrong is to assume that a particular outcome was preordained because of Latinidad. It misses the fact that Latino identity has always been constructed, sometimes by media companies trying to make a unified market of consumers hailing from many different countries, but also by political entrepreneurs—both Latino and non-Latino—seeking to create and manipulate a sense of community to serve particular political projects.

Indeed, the popularization of the designation “Hispanic” occurred when Richard Nixon shredded the Republican Party’s relationship with Black voters through the adoption of the Southern strategy, aimed at capturing white Democrats disaffected by civil rights reform. As Republicans sought a new minority group to court—one that would allow them to collect new votes from resentful whites while denying charges of racism—“Hispanics” were given a new census category, small business support, and eventually a Ronald Reagan–supported amnesty in the mid-1980s, which provided a path to citizenship for an earlier generation of undocumented immigrants.

These efforts could have cemented a positive relationship—Reagan remains an icon for many older Mexican Americans—but the opportunity for political realignment was quickly squandered. By the time the bulk of the newly legalized population had satisfied the residency requirements to become citizens, California’s Republican governor Pete Wilson tarnished the party’s brand by linking his 1994 reelection campaign to Proposition 187, a statewide ballot measure that threatened to deny crucial services to those in the country without authorization.

The initiative passed overwhelmingly (though it was later ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge). In the 1970s and 1980s, nearly half of all new immigrants coming to the United States settled in the Golden State—the sort of “immigrant shock” that later fueled Trump’s reelection in 2024. But Prop 187’s victory also prompted a wave of Latino activism, which came just as California was becoming a majority-minority state. This demographic shift made the idea of a coalition of “people of color” seem not just viable but politically salient. Newly naturalized and newly engaged voters brought change: there was a sharp increase in Latino elected officials in the state, generally working in alliance with Black political leaders, and California began leading the nation on issues of immigrant inclusion.

The idea that Latinos normally lean left was reinforced in the 2010s, when Arizona’s attack on immigrants through SB 1070 (known as the “show me your papers” law, because it required local law enforcement to ask about immigration status in routine encounters) provoked another wave of Latino activism in that state. From 2008 until 2018, no Democratic candidate won a statewide election in Arizona; now the governor, both senators, the secretary of state, and the attorney general are all Democrats, even if the state legislature is solidly in Republican hands. Partly because of these experiences in the Southwest—along with the traditional solid blue hue of Puerto Rican voters—many assumed that Hispanics were progressive by default. (One exception is Cuban Americans, although even in that group Obama made big inroads and raised Democratic hopes of realignment.)

As such, few prognosticators had a Trump near-victory among Latino voters on their bingo cards. Surely, they thought, no self-respecting Latino would risk the deportation of a loved one, the pain of their family being torn apart, or the body blow of enforcement activities that would send migrants to countries (and prisons) from which they had not emigrated or even visited.

Some seem to believe that we need only wait for electoral buyer’s remorse to bring Latinos and others back to the progressive fold. After all, the Trump administration has given up on cheap eggs and supported expensive tariffs. It has violated due process, celebrated cruelty, and denied protected status for Venezuelans and others who had hoped that they would be spared and that their left-leaning home countries would be attacked. And it has proposed cuts to government spending that will limit opportunity for Latino youth, who now comprise 26 percent of all young people in the United States, double the share of Black youth.

Certainly, the current chaos on the streets of Los Angeles should be enough to trigger a rethinking of political allegiances. ICE has been unleashed, in cooperation with other federal agencies, to conduct raids that are more likely to pick up a car washer who has lived in the United States for thirty years than a gang member who recently arrived. Community members have engaged in mass protests and have also responded directly, recording arrests and shouting obscenities at masked ICE agents who refuse to identify themselves.

But relying on hot rage and bubbling resentment to cure the pro-Trump sentiment that infected Latino voters is, at best, reactive. Progressives will only make lasting progress with Latino voters if their strategy includes a deep examination not just of why Trump was appealing, but also of why the left was not. That in turn requires going beyond electioneering to the more grassroots tasks of community organizing, consciousness-building, and alliance formation—the terrain of movements, not ambitious political entrepreneurs.

Dissecting Identity

It is in movement, and its absence, that political mindsets are determined. Most electoral efforts assume that there is a group to be activated, if only we can reach them. This is the basis of the perennial view of the Latino community as a “sleeping giant” that can be stirred leftward with just the right nudge to awaken it to action. But this ambition to effectively replay the impact of Prop 187 is misplaced. A highly diverse community, starkly divided by both country of origin and region of residence, cannot be roused from political slumber with a one-size-fits-all approach.

By contrast, community organizing assumes that identity must be forged, and that many different identities are solidified in alliance with others. Unfortunately, such base-level organizing has been eroding in the United States—a problem for all progressive campaigns. We have instead seen a too-frequent reliance on mobilization, which appeals narrowly to those who are already convinced to show up to a demonstration where the language is correct, the chants are practiced, and the issues are settled.

Organizing is messier than that. It involves one-on-one efforts to build relationships by listening to lived experiences, political views, and racialized perspectives that might initially be jarring. To communicate, we need less emphasis on perfect positions and pithy pronouncements targeted to those who already agree with us, and more focus on bringing in new constituencies (and addressing the issues and biases that prevent coalition-building). This is the only way to counter the divide-and-conquer strategy that the right has long exploited. For the Latino community, one key task in that regard is tackling anti-Blackness, the toxic stew of racism and colorism that persists even though about 5 percent of Latinos in the United States also identify as Black or partly Black on Census questionnaires.

There are plenty of examples showing how organizers are doing the hard work of bringing Black, brown, Asian, and other communities together in productive ways. My own research on the formation of Latino identity and politics in South Los Angeles highlights how dedicated outreach and organizing managed to transform a set of initial Black-brown tensions over jobs and housing—which also erupted in well-publicized fights between students sharing (and not sharing) space at rapidly changing local schools—into lasting coalitions fighting for justice and opportunity for all residents.

This did not result from a purely transactional strategy based on narrow self-interest. Instead, organizers managed to develop a place-based solidarity in which Latino identity was shaped by a sense of shared struggle with African American neighbors. And it’s not just Los Angeles. In her analysis of rising Latino communities in the South, sociologist Jennifer Jones highlights how experiences of racism and exclusion led to a sense of “minority linked fate.” This outcome was not automatic: it required outreach from both groups, including African American leaders who actively opposed anti-immigrant policies and discourse, and it required work on a shared political consciousness, including bringing communities together through faith institutions. As she eloquently puts it, “Democrats can build a new coalition. They just need to look at the facts on the ground to do it.”

“Get out the vote” shortcuts that only engage people during elections cannot replace patient community-based work that can forge lasting relationships. Integrated voter engagement (IVE) strategies—where year-round community organizing meets time-sensitive electoral politics—can bridge these two worlds. Sometimes also called “deep canvassing,” such strategies have been effective in places as varied as Michigan, Georgia, and Virginia. In California, dedicated IVE efforts by coalitions like the Million Voters Project have been key to keeping the Golden State’s Latino electorate closer to the progressive side of the equation (though even there, Trump made gains that likely helped cost the Democrats their House majority). Bottom line: winning over Latino (and other) hearts and minds requires less high tech and more high touch.

It’s the Economy, Estúpido

So what was Trump’s appeal to Latinos? Simply put, he spoke forcefully to people’s financial pain. For many white constituencies, “economic anxiety” may sometimes have been just an excuse to indulge racial fears, but inflation, jobs, and housing costs seem to have been on the top of Latino voters’ minds as they decided to hold their noses and cast their ballots.

This situation might invite another sort of wait-and-see response: let’s just point out where Trump is coming up short (aren’t eggs still expensive?), stress the disparate impact of his policies (won’t Latino families be hurt even more by cuts in Medicaid?), and hope that the long-sleeping Latino giant will finally wake up. That is at least a small improvement from the previous Democratic approach, which was in effect to ask people to believe the good economic data and not their own experience, and then deliver a PowerPoint about the upside of post-neoliberal industrial policy.

That’s a mouthful, of course—and it clearly didn’t work. One problem is that when progressives have thought about the culture wars, they tend to mean only questions of religion and ethnicity. But class is culture too. For example, discussion of the white working-class experience has been enriched by considering not just the loss in income from deindustrialization but also the concurrent loss of meaning and self-worth when jobs disappear. That understanding may be crucial to recapturing the Midwest—but it is no less the case for Latino identities and political priorities, which are defined not only by language and ancestry, but also by economic circumstances.

Indeed, under a definition of “working class” offered by the Center for American Progress—restricted to those holding or seeking a job who lack a four-year college degree—nearly 80 percent of Latinos are working class, compared to about 70 percent of Black Americans and only 55 percent of white Americans. The obvious takeaway is that any conception of a working-class base must be multiracial—but the more subtle lesson is that we ignore how class determines culture and identity at our political peril.

I grew up in a multiracial working-class community in Southern California. Certain commonly held key values defined us, especially a connection to work, craft, and solidarity. The last was driven home to me after my dad suffered a serious workplace injury, which took most of a lung and left our family short on income and food. When he finally healed, his union was on strike. Naturally, the company asked him to return to work, hoping that the need to provide for us would drive him to say yes. Instead, he went straight to the picket line. Cut off from the company’s sick pay and instead reliant on scarce strike funds, we were a little bit hungry but a whole lot proud—and a lesson was seared in.

As much as the foods we eat and the languages we speak, culture is about the values we share. The progressive economic message is often something along the lines of “there’s enough wealth to go around.” But a more winning message, particularly for Latinos who aspire to social mobility, might be: “there’s enough work to go around.” There are enough ways to earn, own, and thrive—and economic policy should include a safety net, to be sure, but it should also provide a springboard, from which work is rewarded with both pay and dignity.

This is a general problem: Democrats and progressives need a better economic story. The key is to speak not just to redistribution but also to production and opportunity. It’s also crucial to imagine workers not just as steelworkers and auto assemblers reeling from deindustrialization, but also as maids, gardeners, elder caregivers, service workers, and others who do the support and care work that helps all of us thrive. Latinos are a key part of the class project, and the attention of unions in recent decades to organizing Latino workers is welcome.

Misreading Migration

In 2008, there were about one-and-a-half times as many Latino youth citizens turning eighteen as there were Latino adult immigrants naturalizing and gaining citizenship. Back then, if you had to choose whether to focus on immigration or on, say, education and the economy, it was reasonable to put at least part of the emphasis on immigrant rights. But in the last few years, the number of Latino citizen youth gaining voting status by aging in is about three times the number of Latino immigrants gaining voting status by naturalizing.

Demographics are not always destiny, but these numbers help us understand why issues other than immigration dominate Latino voters’ consciousness. A further factor is the recent waves of migration into the country. Despite Trump’s decade-long hysteria about immigration, flows to the United States from Mexico were hovering near net zero—that is, about as many Mexicans leaving as arriving—if we look at the period from 2005 until just before the pandemic. Moreover, until about 2021, the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States fell steadily, in part because the 2008 financial crisis dried up economic opportunities and forced people back to their home countries.

That meant that, on average, whoever was here had been here longer. In both 1980 and 1990, less than half of Latino immigrants had been in the country for more than a decade; by 2021, nearly 80 percent of Latino immigrants had been here for more than a decade. These long-settled immigrants became like their U.S.-born neighbors: many looked askance at the Biden-era surge of migrants arriving at the border in 2021–23, a period when the undocumented population of the United States grew by around 20 percent.

It wasn’t just the size of the shift that gave some settled Latino immigrants pause, but the fact that many of the new immigrants came from newer origin countries such as Venezuela and Haiti. The narrative of “disorder at the border” also conveyed a picture of chaos that inspired fear of, and lack of empathy for, the new migrants. And the fact that some new arrivals received support as asylum seekers led to a remarkable shift of opinion even among long-time undocumented residents, who pointed out how they had made it without such aid. That likely influenced their mixed-status family members to lean rightward when they voted.

The current situation has put progressive immigrant rights groups in an uncomfortable position. They fundamentally believe in the right of people to move to opportunity, particularly in a time when climate change is forcing a worldwide exodus from countries hit hard by hurricanes, drought, and famine. Accepting more migrants makes great sense; the United States should be welcoming, particularly given our role in heating the planet. But “open borders”—not a policy supported by serious advocates, but definitely a term exploited by their unserious and opportunistic critics—is a hard sell even for Latinos.

According to a recent poll commissioned by UnidosUS and several other Latino organizations, only slightly more than half of Latinos favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for a long time, while nearly half favor cracking down on “human smugglers and drug traffickers.” But when given a choice between deporting all undocumented immigrants or only “dangerous criminals,” more than three-fourths of respondents choose the latter, suggesting real concerns about border security but also great empathy for undocumented residents who have been in the country for some time.

Here again, Latino identity is complicated, contested, and constituted. Even before the disruption of Latino lives in Los Angeles by the onslaught of reckless ICE raids, there was emerging evidence that Latinos were coming to think that the Trump administration was going too far in its enforcement activities—and that its promises of economic prosperity were not taking shape. But taking political comfort in such community discomfort—thinking that surely this will tip Latinos left again—has long been the Achilles’s heel of those who seek to organize Latinos.

Just mobilizing people against what’s threatening about the other side does not get you a majority that will stick with you for the long haul. For that, you need to propose what you will renew, not just what you will resist. The recent mayoral primary in New York—in which a South Asian progressive, Zohran Mamdani, won Latino and other voters with not just a good ground game and key endorsements, but also a laser-like focus on the economy and quality of life—suggests what is possible.

Movements and Momentum

Indeed, Latinos are open to a positive, progressive, and practical agenda. Years of polling research in California shows that Latinos actually care far more about climate change than white residents of the state—so a commitment to environmentalism is a selling point. The Latino population is also disproportionately working class: economic opportunity and fairness, as well as access to education and healthcare, are top concerns in most surveys. While Trump’s ICE may bring Latinos tentatively back to the progressive fold for now, the central message remains: courting Latinos for the future is very much a multi-issue affair.

That is a political opening for progressives who care about the planet, worry about the excesses of contemporary capitalism, and believe in a positive role for government. But to seize it, analysts need to stop looking to cast shade on how Kamala Harris came up short—which, after all, might be best directed at the 60 percent of white men who voted for Trump—and instead seek to answer why so many Latinos and others were tempted by a wannabe strongman.

The reality is that authoritarianism has been appealing because our economy is malfunctioning for the many, and blame is the only commodity in excess supply; because our movements have been of insufficient scale and their recent growth has been hampered by internal divisions, a slippage in organizing training, and a lack of skills in building broad popular fronts; and because current politics often operates on metrics more attuned to winning elections in the short term than to guiding durable movements for the long term.

The hard work of such movement organizing involves moving from issues to vision, and convincing people of a shared sense of purpose, one that brings them not just to the polls every few years, but to the barricades of change. It’s a task that has been put on steroids by the advent of techno-authoritarianism, an era in which Silicon Valley is no longer a source of potential liberatory technology but a fount of ideas for totalizing control.

Latinos were never sleeping; they’ve just been too often ignored and misunderstood. For the progressive movement to not just resist right-wing authoritarianism but also build power in this moment, it will need to create, not assume, identity; construct an economic program that resonates with lived experience; and offer a vision of opportunity, community, and dignity that cuts across what divides us.

Oil rises nearly 5% on fresh US sanctions against Russia,"Oil prices surged around 5% to a two-week high today after the US imposed sanctions on major Russian suppliers Rosneft and Lukoil over Russia's war in Ukraine.

Sanctions against Russia could reduce the supply of oil available to global markets as Russia was the world's second-biggest crude producer in 2024 after the US, according to US energy data.

Brent futures rose $2.91, or 4.7%, to $65.50 a barrel at 1451 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.89, or 4.9%, to $61.39.

That put Brent on track for its highest close since October 8 and WTI on track for its highest close since October 9.

In addition to soaring crude prices, US diesel futures jumped over 5%, boosting the diesel crack spread to its highest since February 2024. Crack spreads measure refining profit margins.

Multiple trade sources told Reuters that Chinese state oil majors have suspended purchases of seaborne Russian oil from the two companies now under US sanctions, providing a further boost to prices.

However, prices pared some gains after the Kuwaiti oil minister said that the OPEC group would be ready to offset any shortage in the market by rolling back output cuts.

The US sanctions mean refineries in China and India, major buyers of Russian oil, will need to seek alternative suppliers to avoid exclusion from the Western banking system, said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen.

The US said it was prepared to take further action as it called on Moscow to agree immediately to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

More sanctions

Britain sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil last week and EU countries have approved a 19th package of sanctions against Russia that includes a ban on imports of Russian LNG.

The EU also added two Chinese refiners with combined capacity of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) as well as Chinaoil Hong Kong, a trading arm of PetroChina 601857.SS, to its Russia sanctions list, its Official Journal showed on Thursday.

The impact of sanctions on oil markets will depend on how India reacts and if Russia finds alternative buyers, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.

India became the largest buyer of discounted seaborne Russian crude in the aftermath of Moscow's war in Ukraine.

Indian refiners are likely to sharply curtail imports of Russian oil due to the new sanctions, industry sources said on Thursday.

Privately owned Reliance Industries, the top Indian buyer of Russian crude, plans to reduce or halt such imports completely, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

But there remains some scepticism in the market about whether the U.S. sanctions would result in a fundamental shift in supply and demand.

""So far, almost all the sanctions against Russia for the past 3 1/2 years have mostly failed to dent either the volumes produced by the country or the oil revenues,"" said Rystad Energy analyst Claudio Galimberti.

Oversupply concerns following OPEC+ production increases capped crude's gains on Thursday. UBS expects Brent to remain between $60-$70. OPEC+ includes the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia.

On the demand side, U.S. crude oil, gasoline and distillate inventories fell last week as refining activity and demand strengthened, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

At the very least, this announcement serves as a major vote of confidence for Samsung’s lagging foundry business. Musk had previously indicated that TSMC would be the sole producer of the AI5, with Samsung—which already builds the preceding AI4 chip—only slated to handle the subsequent AI6 processor under a massive $16.5 billion contract.
The Tesla CEO went further, offering a surprising endorsement of the South Korean firm's manufacturing edge. Musk claimed that Samsung's new Texas fab has slightly more advanced equipment than TSMC's Arizona site. Regardless of what you think of the man and his recent escapades, this praise is a timely boost for Samsung, which has struggled to close the gap with TSMC, the market leader in this arena.
Ultimately, the shared production deal is a win for both foundries and strengthens the U.S. semiconductor supply chain.

"What’s up with… Nokia, Orange, mobile security","In today’s industry news roundup: Nokia’s third-quarter financials surprise analysts, with booming demand for AI, cloud and 5G putting the company back on track following its profit warning in July; Orange CEO doubles down on consolidation hopes as she reports overall third-quarter revenue and EBITDal growth and claims 300 million customers worldwide; Verizon’s recent Mobile Security Index finds mobile attacks are on the rise, with the threat made worse by the growing use of AI by employees in the workplace; and much more!

Nokia remains on track to achieve its full-year outlook after reporting third-quarter results that certainly seem to have come as a pleasant surprise to analysts, with AI and cloud business providing a welcome boost.As noted by Reuters, the comparable operating profit in the quarter to the end of September reached €435m, while analysts polled by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) expected this metric to reach €342m. The Finland-based vendor appears to be back on a more even keel following a difficult first six months of the year. Indeed, the vendor hadissued a profit warning in July, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. Its outlook now remains unchanged for 2025 as a whole, although it has revised upwards the operating profit outlook by €0.1bn, to between €1.7bn and €2.2bn. This is owing to a change in venture fund reporting after Nokia decided to scale down its passive venture fund investments. In the third quarter, net sales rose 9% to €4.83bn on a comparable basis, said to be aided by strong growth in optical networks and cloud services. In a statement, Nokia president and CEO Justin Hotard said network infrastructure “delivered 11% net sales growth. Optical networks grew 19%, coming largely from AI and cloud customers”. Nokia noted that AI and cloud customers accounted for 6% of net sales at group level, and 14% of network infrastructure sales. According to the Reuters report, Hotard told journalists that AI and datacentre demand “continues to be robust. In fact, it continues to accelerate from our perspective”. Net sales from cloud and network services increased by 13% as “operator investments in 5G core remain strong”, said Hotard. “Our cloud-native 5G core offering continues to gain traction and we are gaining market share”, he added. Hotard highlighted, in particular,the recent deal with VodafoneThree that marked Nokia’s re-entry as a RAN supplier in the UK market for both Vodafone and Three’s combined network operations following their recent merger. For more details about Nokia’s results, seethis press release.

This week has also seen a smattering ofthird-quarter results from telcos, including Orange, which released its figures on Thursday. During the earnings call, Orange Group CEO Christel Heydemann wasted no time in addressing the France-based operator’s consolidation ambitions following its recent€17bn joint takeover offer for certain activities of Alice France, including SFR. The non-binding offer by Bouygues Telecom, Iliad (Free) and Orange was swiftly rejected by Altice, but the trio has indicated that it intends to continue negotiations to see if an agreement can be reached. According to Heydemann, “this deal would allow us to strengthen investments in France while maintaining a competitive ecosystem for the benefit of consumers”. She also stressed there is “no certainty that we will reach an agreement, and we are willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Altice group”. Turning to Orange’s financial performance, Heydemann painted a broadly positive picture for the third quarter, noting that both revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation after lease (EBITDAaL) expenses increased in the three months to 30 September 2025. In fact, EBITDAaL rose by a reasonably healthy 3.7% on a comparable basis to €3.44bn, prompting Orange to increase its annual guidance to at least 3.5%. Revenue rose by a somewhat lower rate of 0.8% to €9.99bn. Heydemann also pointed out that Orange has now passed the “symbolic threshold of 300 million customers worldwide”. In terms of group segments, Africa and the Middle East remained a growth driver, as has now been the case for several quarters. This region saw revenue rise by 12.2% owing to a 13.1% increase in retail revenues, marking 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Orange’s domestic market, France, saw revenue fall by 3.7% on a comparable basis to €4.34bn, blamed in part on the “anticipated decline” in wholesale. At the same time, Orange said mobile net additions in France have reached their highest level since 2022. Excluding France, the Europe segment saw a return to revenue growth with an increase of 4.7%, largely owing to retail services growth. Orange Business, however, remains a work in progress, reporting a 4.3% decline in revenue. The operator described the IT services market as “challenging”, whereas Orange Cyberdefense continued to shine, with a 6.3% revenue increase in the first nine months of the year. For more details about Orange’s results, see this press release.

The various flavours of AI may be good for business, as highlighted by Nokia above, but it also brings a growing level of risk for mobile devices, according to a new report from Verizon Business. TheVerizon 2025 Mobile Security Index (MSI) reveals that mobile devices are “under attack, now more than ever, with 85% of organisations reporting increasing mobile attacks”. Although 75% of organisations are said to have upped their mobile security spending over the past year, the increase in the number of employees using generative AI services for work purposes “is quickly expanding the attack surface”, the report warns. It notes that 34% of organisations “fear that more sophisticated and large-scale AI-powered attacks will significantly increase their risk, and 38% believe ransomware will become even more dangerous when powered by AI”. Chris Novak, VP of global cybersecurity solutions at Verizon Business, declared that this year’s Mobile Security Index “is a clear wake-up call: Mobile security is no longer a perimeter defence but a battle fought in the palm of every employee’s hand. We talk about the perfect storm: With the rise of AI, we’re witnessing a Category 5 hurricane in mobile security, where AI is the wind – and human error is the open window”. For more details about the report’s findings, seethis press release. The report can also be found using this link.

Alternative pan-European long-distance network operatorEXA Infrastructure is maintaining its recent busy streak. On Thursday, it announced it has signed an agreement to purchase all long-haul duct assets belonging to Conexio doo Beograd, a provider of dark fibre and colocation services across Serbia. No financial details of the transaction were provided, however. The operator noted that the transaction further strengthens its “strategic footprint in the Balkans”, and builds on its previous acquisitions of Unitel in Croatia and GCN in Bulgaria. Under the agreement, EXA Infrastructure will buy two high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ducts spanning 860km, existing cables, and 15 points of presence (PoP) locations. The transaction also includes the transfer of existing customer contracts. EXA’s latest move comes hot on the heels of a “major” but unspecified investment in the diversity and capacity of its network between Marseille and Paris. The company also recentlyissued a press release to announce it had “refinanced its existing facilities and raised new financing… to support continued growth ambitions and network expansion plans”. It noted that the combined value of the refinanced debt and new investment is €1.3bn, but didn’t provide many details.",TelecomTV,2025-10-23T14:18:40Z,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/5g/what-s-up-with-nokia-orange-mobile-security-54148/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:21:00.982677

"Blue Jays, MLSE stake drive Rogers revenue growth amid World Series run","Article content

Swelling enthusiasm for the World Series-bound Toronto Blue Jays boosted sales at Rogers Communications Inc., which owns the team and broadcasts its games, nearly offsetting an overall dip in adjusted earnings.

Blue Jays, MLSE stake drive Rogers revenue growth amid World Series run Back to video

Article content

The leap accounted for the vast majority of growth in total revenue, which increased four per cent to $5.35 billion, despite the media segment comprising the smallest of Rogers’ three main areas. Wireless and cable make up the other two.

Article content

Article content

“In media, revenue growth was up 26 per cent, driven by a strong Blue Jays regular season and the consolidation of MLSE results,” chief executive Tony Staffieri told analysts on a conference call Thursday.

Article content

Total profits in the third quarter rose by an order of magnitude to $5.75 billion, mainly due to a one-time non-cash gain linked to Rogers’ acquisition of BCE Inc.’s stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The deal made Rogers the majority owner of the country’s largest sports company, whose assets include the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors.

Article content

Meanwhile, the Blue Jays’ “very strong regular season performance” garnered higher attendance levels and growing interest from fans countrywide, particularly in September when the team clinched a return to the post-season, said chief financial officer Glenn Brandt.

Article content

Regardless of the outcome of the championship contest that kicks off Friday, Rogers will see higher media revenue this month thanks to its baseball franchise.

Article content

“The Blue Jays’ very successful MLB playoffs and World Series run will provide further added growth in the fourth quarter,” Brandt said.

“Go Jays.”

Rogers’ wireless service — its biggest income source — saw revenue dip to $2.06 billion in its latest quarter from $2.07 billion a year earlier.

Article content

“In the highly competitive wireless market, we saw some pressure on service revenue and ARPU (average revenue per user),” Staffieri said. Executives also pointed to lower immigration levels as a reason for the slight downturn.

Article content

Cable revenue climbed to $1.98 billion from $1.97 billion the year before.

Article content

On an adjusted basis, which excluded a $5-billion gain related to the MLSE deal, Rogers said it earned $740 million attributable to shareholders or $1.37 per share in the third quarter, down from $762 million or $1.42 per share a year ago.

Microsoft Reportedly Asked its Xbox division to Deliver 30% Profit Margins,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company was “all-in” on gaming after completing its acquisition of Zenimax/Bethesda back in 2021. However, after several rounds of layoffs, various game cancellations and studio closures, and hardware and software price increases, Microsoft’s Xbox division seems to be in a strange place in 2025.

Today, a new report from Bloomberg reveals that all the things I’ve described above may be the result of Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood putting an unprecedented amount of pressure on the Xbox division. According to the report, Hood implemented a new 30% profit margin target for the Xbox division in fall 2023, far above what’s usually seen across the industry.

“The gaming division, which includes dozens of studios, has responded by canceling products, raising prices and slashing thousands of jobs, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. The average profit margin in the video-game industry in recent years has ranged between 17% and 22%, according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence, while coming in between 10% and 20% over the past six years at Xbox,” Bloomberg wrote.

The report also says that “ot every project is expected to hit the 30% profit threshold, said the people, but many Xbox developers and groups have been presented with the new target.” However, in the past, Xbox’s first-party studios “weren’t asked to hit specific numerical targets” and were instead told to “focus on making the best games possible without worrying too much about finances.”

Well, that obviously changed after Microsoft shut down various studios, including Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks (later purchased by Krafton), and The Initiative. The company also canceled Rare’s Everwild, its Perfect Dark remake, and Zenimax’s Project Blackbird, three games that had been in development for more than seven years.

An Xbox spokesperson told Bloomberg that Microsoft had to make some changes to ensure that its gaming business remains sustainable. “We look at the business as a whole, balancing creativity, innovation, and sustainability across a diverse portfolio of offerings. As with any creative business, sometimes that means making hard decisions and stopping work on things that are no longer working for a variety of reasons, and shifting resources toward the projects that are more aligned with our direction and priorities.”",Thurrott.com,2025-10-23T14:16:06Z,https://www.thurrott.com/games/328745/microsoft-reportedly-asked-its-xbox-division-to-deliver-30-profit-margins,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:21:40.593507

Merz says Europeans fear 'public spaces' due to migration,"On a visit to Potsdam last week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz talked about how his government was toughening up its migration policy. The primary aim, he said, was to continue to combat what he called illegal immigration.

Then he added another sentence, which has since caused a furor: ""But we still have this problem in the cityscape, of course, and that's why the federal interior minister is facilitating and carrying out large-scale deportations.""

The offhand remark has been widely criticized as racist, with many saying the chancellor is echoing the rhetoric of the far-right, anti-migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has been on par with Merz's conservative CDU in recent polls.

Critics from the opposition Greens and the Left Party, but also from Merz's center-left coalition partners, the SPD, have accused the chancellor of fomenting prejudice and furthering societal division by suggesting that diverse urban populations should be targets for deportation, while — incorrectly — blaming them for high crime rates, harassment, and sexual assaults.

Merz has rejected the criticism, though he acknowledged on the sidelines of a summit on the Western Balkans in London on Wednesday that people with a migrant background were ""an indispensable part of our labor market.""

He also claimed, however, that many people in Germany and across Europe were nonetheless ""afraid to move around in public spaces"" due to migrants ""who do not have permanent residence status, do not work, and do not abide by our rules.""

Earlier this week, responding to a reporter at the head office of his conservative CDU party in Berlin, Merz seemed almost amused by the questions over whether he would retract his statement.

""I don't know whether you have children. If you do, and there are daughters among them, ask your daughters what I might have meant. I suspect you'll get a pretty clear and unambiguous answer. There's nothing I need to retract,"" he said.

""There are a lot of people who say, see, and judge it this way,"" Merz reiterated when pressed further. ""Once again: Ask your children, ask your daughters, ask your friends and relatives. They will all confirm that this is a problem — once it gets dark, if not before.""

Merz's comments have been met with several protests in recent days, with thousands of people joining groups like Together Against the Right marching through Berlin. A petition with the title ""We are the Daughters,"" first launched on Tuesday, had been signed by nearly 200,000 people as of Thursday morning. The petition's preamble refutes Merz's statements, saying, ""We are the daughters, and we won't allow ourselves to be manipulated by your racism, Mr. Merz! You don't speak for us."" It also calls for more focus on violence against women.

Among well-known Germans to sign the petition were actor Marie Nasemann and environmental activist Luisa Neubauer, who called out ""racism"" on Instagram.

""There are approximately 40 million daughters in this country. We have a genuine interest in ensuring that our safety is taken seriously,"" said Neubauer. ""What we are not interested in is being misused as a pretext or justification for statements that were ultimately discriminatory, racist and deeply hurtful.""

Last week, a national survey conducted by the opinion research institute Civey showed a mixed picture, with only a third of the 2,500 representative subjects saying Merz's comment was xenophobic. Meanwhile, 59% said it was either definitely or probably not the case.

Germany is 'a very safe country'

Does Germany really have a problem with rising crime? DW investigated this claim in September, and spoke with criminologist Susanne Karstedt, among others. She gave the example of the area around the train station in Frankfurt am Main, which has been a site of prostitution for many years.

""That then attracts violence and drug crime,"" said Karstedt, adding that there are isolated areas like this in Germany where the crime rate is very high. As in many other countries, there is more criminality in urban areas than in the German countryside.

Official statistics from the Federal Criminal Police Office for 2024 show that for every 100,000 German citizens, 1,878 adults and children over the age of 8 committed a crime. Among non-German residents, however, that figure was 5,091. The Criminal Police Office added that it is predominantly young male refugees who account for this higher proportion. Many of them have fled war zones and are traumatized, and they often find themselves isolated in Germany.

However, Karstedt stressed that Germany could be considered a ""very safe country"" overall. ""Here, as in other Western European countries, the crime rate has dropped since the 1980s and 1990s.""

Criticism from both sides

The governing coalition of conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) has been drawn into the debate. On Wednesday, Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil of the SPD warned that politicians ""have to be very careful what kind of discussion we initiate when we suddenly divide people into 'us' and 'them,' into people with a family history of migration and those without.""

Criticism has also come from Merz's CDU party. ""There are, of course, many places where the look and feel of a city is unsettling,"" said Dennis Radtke, a senior party member. ""But to imply that deportations would change that is simplistic, raises unrealistic expectations, and fails to reflect the complexity of the issue.""

Speaking on the German n-tv news program on Monday evening, Tim Klüssendorf, the general secretary of the SPD, said the chancellor was conflating things that should not be. He stressed that people must not be prohibited from addressing problems.

""When I think what this must feel like for people who have come here from elsewhere, whose parents came here, who aren't white or who look different from Friedrich Merz [...] it's not a pleasant feeling,"" said Klüssendorf. ""I think we should avoid that.""

If you had to rank the three video game console manufacturers based on how well they're doing commercially in 2025, the answer for numbers one and two could differ from person to person, with some seeing Nintendo as solidly in first, and others seeing PlayStation. But without a doubt, Microsoft and Xbox are in third place, and it's from this position, from well behind its two biggest competitors, that Microsoft and Xbox management are reportedly asking its studios to hit profit margin goals far above the industry average.

A new report from Bloomberg shows that Microsoft and Xbox are setting 30% profit margin goals for its internal studios. This isn't for every project, as the report clarifies that ""Not every project is expected to hit the 30% profit threshold,"" per Bloomberg's sources, ""but many Xbox developers and groups have been presented with the new target.""

The average profit margins for the rest of the industry have fallen between 17% and 22% since 2018, per the report and analysis from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Neil Barbour, analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, even distinguished 30% or higher margins as the kind of goal you'd set if you were ""a publisher that is really nailing it.""

Thanks to court documents we saw as part of Microsoft closing out its Activision Blizzard acquisition in 2023, we know that just two years ago, the profit margin for Xbox and the gaming division sat at just 12% for most of 2022. Once that merger closed in October 2023, Bloomberg's report claims that Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, implemented the new 30% goal, as if to say that Xbox needed to start making back the money that was spent on making franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush first-party franchises.

Gambles like putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass haven't necessarily paid off though, or at least that's how it seems, since in the last two years after that 30% profit margin goal was set, Microsoft has laid off thousands of employees within its gaming division, closed its own studios and cancelled several highly anticipated projects.

It's worth pointing out that the layoffs aren't entirely due to Xbox Game Studios not hitting the profit margin. We know that while that goal exists, Microsoft has been investing more into AI and would seemingly close, cut, and sell off any project to free up capital to invest even more. But knowing that the company's leadership is asking its game studios to hit well above the industry average does help to explain how leadership gets to the conclusion that these mass layoffs and publishing its first-party titles on competing platforms are necessary.

Of course, you could argue that Amy Hood and Microsoft are setting the gaming division up to fail, because again, Microsoft is nowhere close to being the industry-leading titan we saw in its Xbox 360 days. The sentiment that Microsoft wants out of the video game business is one that continues to grow online, and if that's the end goal for Microsoft, then its playbook of cutting projects from its expert developers, setting unreasonable profit margin goals, and constantly upsetting its consumer base with price hikes on products and services, while pushing features nobody asked for is a solid one.

The report continues to say that the projects likely to get priority within Microsoft and Xbox will be ""cheap to make or deemed more likely to generate significant revenue windfalls,"" which also sounds like we're in for cheaply made games and live service bets that don't try to do anything other than make as much money as possible.

A Microsoft spokesperson quoted in the report adds, ""We look at the business as a whole, balancing creativity, innovation, and sustainability across a diverse portfolio of offerings. As with any creative business, sometimes that means making hard decisions and stopping work on things that are no longer working for a variety of reasons, and shifting resources toward the projects that are more aligned with our direction and priorities.""",Wccftech,2025-10-23T14:13:36Z,https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-asking-xbox-game-studios-to-push-profits-above-rest-of-industry/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:02.142703
SEC Chair Says Regulation Continues Despite Shutdown,"The regulator is still monitoring the markets for signs of manipulative behavior, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said in a Wednesday (Oct. 22) CNBC interview.

“Even during the shutdown, as we conduct our surveillance on the marketplace, we have stopped trading on eight foreign companies on Nasdaq that showed indicia of manipulative behavior — ramp and dump, we call it,” Atkins said.

“So we are monitoring the market for the behavior that indicates, you know, hanky-panky going on in the marketplace,” he added.

The commission, Atkins said, is searching for signs of suspicious trading activity, like sudden and unexplained jump in stock prices despite no news, or anomalous trading surrounding company announcements that could point to insider trading.

“We have a lot of different tools that we can use to analyze this, and we work closely with the self-regulatory organizations, the exchanges and so forth, because they are the immediate ones looking at their markets and doing surveillance over that,” he added.

Still, he said the shutdown has affected the regulator’s work, such as reviewing initial public offering (IPO) registration statements and cryptocurrency legislation proposals.

“Our staff can’t be working on some of the things we would like to roll out,” Atkins said of the pending crypto legislation. “Hopefully by the end of the year, if Congress can let us get back to work, that’s what we’re looking for.”

In regard to IPOs, the SEC said earlier this month that because it was not able to review registration statements, the regulator would not look to penalize companies that left out pricing information from prospectuses filed during the shutdown and then listed either during or after the shutdown.

This week also saw a report that the legal battle over the Trump administration’s mass firings of staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was in limbo due to the shutdown.

The White House has asked for a stay on a rehearing in the case because the relevant Justice Department employees are not permitted to work during the shutdown, Federal News Network reported Wednesday (Oct. 22).

“One interesting thing that we’ll have to see, though, is the courts themselves,” Rich Andreano, a partner at Ballard Spahr, told Federal News Network. “Apparently, they have funding to last sometime into November. If we get to the point they run out of funds, do we have no judges to hear cases at that point? So, it could, if this is an extended one, it could get quite interesting to see what happens at that point.”",pymnts.com,2025-10-23T14:13:24Z,https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2025/sec-chair-says-regulation-continues-despite-shutdown/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:06.018699

US home sales accelerated in September to their fastest pace since February as mortgage rates eased,"By ALEX VEIGA, AP Business Writer

Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes accelerated in September as declining mortgage rates and a pickup in available properties on the market encouraged home shoppers.

Existing home sales rose 1.5% last month from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That’s the fastest sales pace since February.

Sales jumped 4.1% compared with September last year. The latest sales figure came in slightly below the roughly 4.07 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.

The national median sales price climbed 2.1% in September from a year earlier to $415,200. That’s the 27th consecutive month that home prices have risen on an annual basis and the highest median sales price for any September on data going back to 1999.

“The home sales in September showed an increase, but I would not characterize (it) as a breakout,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “It does show that consumers do respond to lower mortgage rates.”

The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.

Mortgage rates started declining in July in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.

Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in July and August, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.75% to 6.56%, according to Freddie Mac. The decline in mortgage rates accelerated in September and this month, dropping the average rate as low as 6.27% last week.

While lower rates boost home shoppers’ purchasing power, borrowing costs remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home following years of skyrocketing prices. The U.S. median home sales price has risen 53% over the past six years, before the housing market superheated during the initial years of the pandemic.

Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates have benefited from a wider selection of properties on the market, which has brought supply and demand more into balance.

There were 1.55 million unsold homes at the end of last month, up 1.3% from August and up 14% from September last year, NAR said. The latest inventory snapshot matches a 5-year high, but remains well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic.

That chronic shortage of homes for sale, especially those in the more affordable end of the market, continues to weigh especially on first-time homebuyers, who don’t have home equity gains to put toward a new home purchase. They accounted for 30% of homes sales last month. Historically, they made up 40% of home sales.

September’s month-end inventory translates to a 4.6-month supply at the current sales pace, matching the supply level at the end of August and an increase from 4.2 months in September last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.

Homes are also taking longer to sell. Properties typically remained on the market for 33 days last month before selling, up from 31 days in August and 28 days in September last year, NAR said.

The longer homes linger on the market, the more pressure it puts on homeowners eager to sell to give buyers a better deal.

Despite easing mortgage rates, many home shoppers bought homes entirely with cash last month. Such transactions made up 30% of all sales, up from 28% in August and unchanged compared to September last year, NAR said.

That reflects a broader trend this year. Roughly one-third of homes sold in the first half of 2025 were paid for in all cash, down slightly from the same period last year, but well above pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent report by Realtor.com.

Mortgage rates will probably ease further through the end of the year, but prospective homebuyers are likely to remain cautious amid uncertain economic conditions, said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.

“The push and pull of lower rates and rising economic uncertainty means that home sales activity is likely to remain steady through the fourth quarter, with total 2025 transactions ending only slightly above last year,” she said.",Boston Herald,2025-10-23T14:12:48Z,https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/23/home-sales-accelerates-september-2025/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:12.475979

Homes are also taking longer to sell. Properties typically remained on the market for 33 days last month before selling, up from 31 days in August and 28 days in September last year, NAR said.

The longer homes linger on the market, the more pressure it puts on homeowners eager to sell to give buyers a better deal.

Despite easing mortgage rates, many home shoppers bought homes entirely with cash last month. Such transactions made up 30% of all sales, up from 28% in August and unchanged compared to September last year, NAR said.

That reflects a broader trend this year. Roughly one-third of homes sold in the first half of 2025 were paid for in all cash, down slightly from the same period last year, but well above pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent report by Realtor.com.

Mortgage rates will probably ease further through the end of the year, but prospective homebuyers are likely to remain cautious amid uncertain economic conditions, said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.

“The push and pull of lower rates and rising economic uncertainty means that home sales activity is likely to remain steady through the fourth quarter, with total 2025 transactions ending only slightly above last year,” she said.",The Denver Post,2025-10-23T14:12:48Z,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/10/23/home-sales-accelerates-september-2025/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:13.124576
US AI revenue in 2025 nearly double closest competitor – analysis,"The US dominates the global artificial intelligence (AI) market at present and will command nearly twice as much revenue than its closest competitor in 2025, new research forecasts.

GlobalData’s AI Global Market Opportunity Forecasts to 2029 report indicates that the US AI market will generate $41bn in revenue during 2025, while second-placed China will generate $24bn.

The US’ strong position is supported by the presence of technology leaders like IBM and Microsoft, which continue to refine and expand their AI offerings in response to generative AI adoption and evolving business requirements. The US generative AI market has registered high growth and investment and reached $2.4bn in 2025. In addition, nearly 70% of US enterprises are now using AI solutions in some capacity, underlining the technology’s widespread integration across industries.

GlobalData analyst Rohit Sharma commented: “The strength of the US AI market comes from its enterprises being early adopters and willing to experiment with new technologies. Backed by a world-class ecosystem of chipmakers, cloud providers and software innovators, US companies are quick to scale AI across critical functions, particularly in banking and IT, where security and compliance are essential.

“This culture of rapid adoption combined with supportive policies like the CHIPS Act and a deep talent pool, positions the US to sustain its leadership in AI revenue growth.”

Macroeconomic and industry drivers

The rapid expansion of the global AI market is influenced by multiple macroeconomic factors, including technological advancements, government support and investment in infrastructure. Regions that encourage innovation through favourable regulations and strong funding are seeing faster adoption, while restrictive environments act as barriers.

AI adoption has accelerated due to advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, robotics and generative AI. Further, the unprecedented generation of structured and unstructured data from digital platforms, connected devices, advancements in GPUs and purpose-built AI chips are making it feasible to process this data in real time.

These capabilities are unlocking high-value use cases from predictive healthcare and autonomous vehicles to fraud detection and personalised commerce cementing AI as a foundational layer of modern industry transformation.

Asia-Pacific records the fastest growth

The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region posted the highest growth rate between 2020 and 2025 and is anticipated to sustain the momentum during the 2025-29 period. Government-backed AI programs are a major driver. In early 2025, both India and South Korea advanced their AI roadmaps – India unveiled a plan to deploy 18,000 high-performance GPU systems to fuel AI development, while South Korea’s Presidential AI Committee set out a programme to build a world-class large language model.

China leads the APAC market, contributing $24bn in revenue in 2025. The country’s large population along with the availability of a skilled workforce is expected to further drive the growth of AI market across various verticals, especially banking and information technology. However, evolving government regulations remain a potential challenge to faster market expansion.",Verdict,2025-10-23T14:12:17Z,https://www.verdict.co.uk/us-ai-revenue-in-2025-nearly-double-closest-competitor-analysis/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:15.672373

"Blockchain.com secures MiCA license, hires Malta insider to head EU expansion","Blockchain.com, one of the oldest crypto platforms operating a wallet and a blockchain explorer, has received regulatory approval in Europe as it ramps up compliance efforts.

Blockchain.com obtained a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) license from the Maltese Financial Services Authority (MFSA), the company said on Thursday.

With the license, Blockchain.com is enabled to provide custody and wallet services in 30 European Economic Area (EEA) countries and plans to roll out institutional services, including treasury management.

“Prior to MiCA, the company operated within a fragmented regulatory environment,” a spokesperson for Blockchain.com told Cointelegraph, adding that the license helps it consolidate those services across the EEA under a single regulatory umbrella.

New exec from Malta’s financial association

“Malta’s regulatory clarity and strategic position make it the ideal hub to scale Blockchain.com’s European operations,” Blockchain.com co-founder and CEO Peter Smith said.

To lead its EU strategy, Blockchain.com has appointed Fiorentina D’Amore, a chairperson of the Financial Institutions Malta Association (FIMA), as senior director of EU business operations and CEO of Blockchain.com Malta.

Launched in 2017, FIMA is an association representing licensed financial institutions in Malta, aiming to promote the industry in cooperation with local and EU-wide regulators. With previous experience at major platforms including Bitpanda and eToro, D’Amore will oversee Blockchain.com’s operations across the EU, focusing on strategic growth.

“Leveraging off the momentum of our MiCA license, we will continue to advance the balance of innovation and compliance across the region,” D’Amore said.

Malta stands out in MiCA approach

Malta’s approach to issuing MiCA licenses has attracted both attention and controversy within the EU.

In July, the MFSA came under scrutiny of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), Europe’s primary MiCA supervisory authority, for certain authorization shortfalls. The Maltese regulator later clarified that these issues posed no risk to its MiCA licensing process, underscoring the country’s role as an early adopter of crypto regulation.

Malta also stands out in its stance against EU centralization on crypto supervision.

While member states such as France have called for ESMA to take direct supervision of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), Malta has argued that it is too soon to implement such a major change, with MiCA having been in full force for less than a year.

“It is premature to assess its full impact, especially on CASPs, and the MFSA believes that now is not the appropriate moment to introduce additional layers of supervision that could potentially hinder competitiveness and innovation within the digital assets market,” the regulator said in a statement on Sept. 17.",Cointelegraph,2025-10-23T14:11:55Z,https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-com-mica-eu-institutions-malta-mfsa,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:27.783757
"Surfshark expands network to 4,500 servers – but ""quality is more important than quantity""","Surfshark brings its server count to 4,500, a 40% increase in its network size

Yet, Surfshark said server quality is more important than sheer quantity

That's why the VPN includes tools to boost connection stability and speed

VPN firm Surfshark has just announced a 40% expansion of its global VPN server network, bringing its total count to an impressive 4,500.

This move enhances Surfshark's global coverage and provides users with more connection options, which can help reduce server load and improve speeds.

However, the company is using this moment to challenge a long-held industry metric: that a higher server count is always better.

For years, VPN providers have used the size of their server network as a key selling point. While a large number of servers can be beneficial, Surfshark argues that customers should look beyond the numbers.

The company stressed that the true measure of a top-tier service lies in the quality, consistency, and performance of its infrastructure, not just its size.

This expansion demonstrates Surfshark's commitment to providing one of the best VPN services on the market, ensuring it has the capacity to serve a growing user base.

At the same time, its focus on quality sends a clear message that reliability and user experience are its top priorities, a sentiment that echoes a similar argument recently made by its rival, NordVPN.

Quality over quantity

Diving deeper into the ""quality over quantity"" debate, Surfshark explained that while broad global coverage is essential, it’s the user experience that truly defines a VPN's worth.

A VPN server is the crucial piece of hardware that encrypts a user's internet traffic and masks their IP address, but its effectiveness depends on how well it's maintained and optimized.

""Server count is an easy and understandable metric for comparing VPN providers, but it doesn’t capture the full picture,"" said Justas Pukys, Senior Product Manager at Surfshark.

""A strong VPN delivers not just broad reach but reliable, high-performance servers, minimized latency, and uninterrupted connections across its network. In practice, this means robust uptime, proactive maintenance, and a smooth, user-friendly experience for all online activities,"" Pukys added.

This approach means that instead of just adding more and more locations, the company is focusing on ensuring each server provides a fast and stable connection. This is particularly important for activities like streaming in 4K, online gaming, or heavy torrenting, where a sudden drop in speed or a lost connection can be incredibly frustrating.

Innovation is key

To back up its commitment to quality, Surfshark highlighted several new technologies it has developed to enhance its network performance. These innovations are part of its proprietary Nexus SDN (software-defined networking) technology, which aims to revolutionize how consumer VPNs operate.

Two key components recently introduced areEverlink andFastTrack.

Everlink is an industry-first patented technology designed to improve VPN connection stability, ensuring users remain connected even in challenging network conditions.

FastTrack, on the other hand, is an innovative system that automatically optimizes traffic paths to deliver the best possible speeds and performance for the user's specific location and activity.

By combining this strategic expansion with cutting-edge technology, Surfshark aims to build a faster, more secure, and exceptionally stable network. This two-pronged approach ensures it can handle future growth and evolving user demands while continuing to deliver the high-quality experience its customers have come to expect.

Bitcoin whales add 40X leverage BTC shorts ahead of Trump announcement,"Key points:

Bitcoin whales flip bearish on BTC price action hours before Trump makes another White House announcement.

“Insider” market bets have featured prominently since Oct. 10, when Bitcoin hit $102,000 on Binance.

Traders say that $107,000 is now the next line in the sand.

Bitcoin (BTC) risked fresh losses into Thursday’s Wall Street open as whales flipped short BTC.

Bitcoin whales pile on shorts again

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price action tapping but failing to hold $110,000.

Acting in an increasingly narrow range, BTC/USD offered little cause for optimism ahead of some classic volatility triggers.

US President Donald Trump was scheduled to make an announcement from the White House at 3 pm Eastern Time, and large-volume Bitcoin traders were betting on bad news.

Bitcoin OG Kyle Chasse described one whale’s 40X leveraged BTC short as “insane.”

“We see quite a big liquidation cluster just above $106k,” he added in a further post on X.

An accompanying chart showed liquidation levels on exchange order books from monitoring resource CoinGlass, with these often acting as near-term price magnets.

Additional CoinGlass data showed various new whale shorts opening on the day, including those with a significant amount of leverage.

As Cointelegraph reported, suspicions have accompanied whale plays throughout October after certain entities appeared to front-run news headlines and comments from Trump. The phenomenon originally surfaced on Oct. 10, when BTC/USDT fell from all-time highs to a low of $102,000 on Binance.

Concentrating on overall trader behavior, onchain analytics platform Glassnode revealed “defensive” positioning.

“Net-premium flows reveal concentrated selling across the $109K–$115K range, indicating that recent moves higher are being used to hedge,” it reported on Bitcoin options markets.

“This suggests traders are positioning defensively into strength while the market consolidates.”

Bearish BTC price predictions stay in place

Already bearish market participants doubled down on their existing warnings.

Trader Roman, concerned about a lack of trading volume even at the all-time highs, said that the situation would turn “get ugly fast” for Bitcoin below $107,000.

“So far we’ve held but I wanted to show that it’s not just a horizontal support, it’s a diagonal support for a near year and a half long uptrend,” he told X followers about the weekly chart.

Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades agreed that volume in the current range was “pretty thin.”

“The $111K level is what matters in the short term. If price can break and hold above that point, we can start looking for higher,” he wrote on Thursday.

“It's good that the $107K level held during all this weakness also from stocks yesterday. But that is a key support to hold going forward.”

FeelTect raises €1.5m in funding round to commercialise wound-care technology,"Galway-based medtech company FeelTect has raised €1.5 million in a funding round that will help the company bring its cutting-edge wound care device to the market.

Tight Alright is a new wound treatment monitoring technology used to treat leg ulcers. The wearable device’s pressure sensors wirelessly connect with a digital platform that allows care providers to monitor sub-bandage pressure applied during compression therapy. That can reduce healing times and treatment costs.

The company is now set to launch commercially, with Thun Hospital, Switzerland, the first to get on board.

Co-Founder Darren Burke said the launch was a “major milestone” for both the company and wound care globally.

“After years of rigorous testing and clinical validation, Tight Alright is now ready to empower clinicians and patients with real-time insights that will transform the model of care,” he said.

The funding, which will help facilitate a wider launch, came through Irrus Investments, the Western Development Commission (WDC), and a network of angel investors. A previous round in 2023 saw the company raise a similar amount, with the aim of commercialising the technology. Irrus Investments also participated in that round, along with the Halo Business Angels network.

FeelTect said the money in the latest round will also help support the commercial roll-out of the device, as well as regulatory expansion and help the company expand its team.

“We’re proud to be growing our team and scaling our operations right here in Spiddal,” said Mr Burke. “The west of Ireland has everything we need to support our journey to becoming a global MedTech leader.”

The new funding builds on WDC’s previous backing of the health tech startup, with the organisation also offering advice and support to help FeelTect navigate the regulatory and technical pathways of medical device development.

“FeelTect embodies the innovation and ambition we aim to support in the West of Ireland,” said CEO of the Western Development Commission, Allan Mulrooney. Their success demonstrates how regional start-ups can make a global impact with world-class technology.”",The Irish Times,2025-10-23T14:10:14Z,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/10/23/feeltect-raises-15m-in-funding-round-to-commercialise-wound-care-technology/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:40.049278

Apple could really shake up iPhone release dates and numbers,"The iPhone 20 is reportedly coming sooner than you might think. Apple is so eager to release the 20th anniversary model that it might skip a number and introduce the iPhone 20 months before the usual schedule.

iPhone 20 for iPhone’s 20th anniversary

Apple has followed a nice, simple pattern for new handsets since the iPhone 11 arrived in 2019. New versions come out each September, and the model numbers go up by one. Thus, the iPhone 12, iPhone 13 … all the way up to the new iPhone 17 series last month.

This system is apparently going out the window.

Word first went out a few months ago that Apple plans to split the iPhone releases into two phases starting in 2026. The high-end “Pro” models will continue to come out in the fall, but the two cheaper variants will wait until the following spring.

On Wednesday, Omdia chief researcher Heo Moo-yeol generally agreed with that prediction, but then threw a curveball: There won’t be an iPhone 19. And the model called the iPhone 20 will come out far earlier than expected.

iPhone 19? What iPhone 19?

“Apple will launch iPhone 18e and iPhone 20 in the first half of 2027, and iPhone 20 Air, Pro, Pro Max and iPhone Fold 2 will be released in the second half of 2027,” said Heo (based on an AI translation of an article by South Korean publication Electronic Times).

While skipping a model number might seem odd, there’s a good reason for it. The original iPhone launched in 2007, so 2027 will mark the device’s 20th anniversary. Apple clearly wants iPhone 20 to launch that year.

Tinkering with model numbers is necessary because Apple hasn’t followed a consistent pattern of product numbering over the decades. There’s no better example than the second model: the iPhone 3G. The fifth model was the iPhone 4s, and so on.

What is unusual is that, if the Omdia analyst’s prediction holds true, starting in 2027, customers will be able to buy the base model iPhone 20 for half a year before the Pro versions hit the market.",Cult of Mac,2025-10-23T14:07:36Z,https://www.cultofmac.com/news/iphone-20-could-launch-early,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:46.975896
Meet the marketing team behind LSU sports' giveaways,"At LSU, students and fans wait in line for hours at games just for the chance to get their hands on unique merchandise for a small price — attendance.

The giveaways form from the minds of the marketing team. Everything is planned months before it’s brought to stadiums on game day for fans to take home and enjoy.

This exchange between fan and product is personal for the marketing staff at LSU.

“When [the giveaway] is in high demand and you see fans really going after something that was your brainchild, it’s really cool and rewarding to see,” said assistant director of marketing Grace Ghee.

It’s a sentiment shared by many in the same position. Rhett LeBlanc, a former marketing graduate assistant at LSU who became a marketing coordinator at the University of Florida, said that seeing the shirts and hats around campus, which he helped create as part of these giveaways, felt fulfilling.

He is now back at LSU, serving as the assistant director of live events.

With a variety of athletic events to account for, LeBlanc, Ghee and the rest of the marketing staff have to get creative long in advance. For football, marketing plans for t-shirt tosses and other gameday promotions are finalized in May. Plans for basketball season are set in stone before the fall semester begins in August, associate AD of marketing Dave Haskin said.

Team members work throughout the year on ideas and send them through to production once approved.

“It’s one of those fun parts of the job, getting to be completely creative and come up with some really cool stuff,” said director of marketing Julia Fecke.

The never-ending creative cycle asks the staff to dig deep into its bag of knowledge of current trends in fashion and draw inspiration from other sports teams’ giveaways.

“For any sport we’ve done giveaways for, I try to do something that I would want … If it’s something that I don’t think I would want to wear, or [have] in my office or at my house, then why do it?” Kelsey Dulinski, director of fan experience, said. “As far as the design goes, I look at what’s trending and what people are wearing.”

General fashion trends that are picked up from TikTok or X play a large part in the merchandise designs for giveaways, she said. Some of the most popular items from last year were from men’s basketball games, such as the cream vintage sweatshirt, which can still easily be spotted on students during the winter.

Like this giveaway, the best and most drawing items are typically reserved for the biggest events.

“With the SEC games later in the year, we want a competitive advantage from our fans, being there and cheering loud,” assistant director of marketing Matt Westman said.

Enticing promotions and larger quantities of the items are key to getting more people in the stadium. Students are the main target for the marketing team, with many giveaways available exclusively to them.

“I think our student fan base is one of the best in the country,” Haskin said. “They love LSU. They love coming to support their fellow colleagues and student-athletes on campus.”

The goal is to get students to games of a sport they previously wouldn’t have considered attending. Haskin said that freshmen and transfer students, in particular, are heavily encouraged to attend games and get involved on campus with athletics.

LSU helps market its smaller sports with mid-event competitions for students as well. The smaller budget for less-funded sports means the marketing team gets extra creative.

Last year, LSU hosted a cannonball competition for students during a swim and dive meet against No. 2-ranked Texas. The competition had raving reviews from LSU and Texas fans alike, as well as from John Trapp, the winning student who received an LSU Swim and Dive backpack for his splash.

Marketing graduate assistant Michael Paust said the swim and dive team will build on the well-received competition from 2024. On Oct. 24, LSU will host a Student Splash Dash Race where students will race on kickboards through the pool.

Track and field also hosted a student event in April — a 50-meter dash to crown the “fastest Tiger on campus.”

“I remember specifically a couple of students were like, ‘Oh man, this is awesome,’” Haskin said. “‘I’ve never been to a track meet before.’ Then I saw them come back for another one later in the year.”

He said that the most important aspect of these giveaways and events is getting the students and fan base excited.

Some upcoming giveaways include a senior shirt at the soccer team’s final home game on Oct. 26 and many t-shirt giveaways throughout the men’s and women’s basketball seasons. The PMAC often offers free food to the first few hundred students through the door.

The purple cowboy hat giveaway at the Oct. 10 soccer game helped make it the fifth-highest attended game in program history. The first 500 fans received a voucher to get their hat at halftime, and they returned to the bleachers, inspecting and proudly wearing their new accessory.

Some giveaways have fans lining up for hours, like the Mardi Gras jerseys handed out for the men’s basketball game against Tennessee last year.

“You want to reward the people who are in line and are waiting,” Dulinski said. “Rewarding those students or fans that are coming in first and spending that pre-game time [in the stadium].”

Having fans arrive early for the giveaways helps boost the energy before the event begins. It also brings them closer to LSU Athletics and the university itself.

“That’s what we do, we create memories that last a lifetime,” Haskin said. “That’s kind of our mantra, and that’s our why, because this place is very special.”",Lsureveille.com,2025-10-23T14:07:31Z,https://lsureveille.com/266623/sports/lsu-athletics-giveaways-are-boosting-attendance-across-all-sports-meet-the-team-behind-it-all/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:22:52.011590

"Kantar’s Jeff Greenspoon on growth, AI & why company’s center of gravity is shifting west","Together, their appointments mark a deliberate shift: Kantar is moving its C-suite center of gravity from London to North America, signaling that the region is now the driving force of its global growth agenda. The new leadership team inherits a business that has quietly reinvented itself – from a traditional research firm into what Greenspoon calls “an AI-native growth consultancy.”

Once part of WPP, Kantar was carved out and acquired by Bain Capital in 2019. The private-equity ownership gave it the freedom and funding to modernize at speed. Free from holding company structures, it rebuilt its platforms, invested heavily in AI and automation and redefined itself from a data supplier to a growth consultancy. That independence – and Bain’s appetite for transformation – is what’s powering the company’s current acceleration.

“Kantar used to be a market research company,” says Greenspoon, when we meet at the ANA Masters of Marketing Conference 2025 in Orlando. “Then it became an insights partner. Now, it’s a growth partner. The more data we can connect – our own and our clients’ – the better we can help brands make decisions that create enterprise value, not just measure it after the fact.”

It’s a subtle but important distinction. Behind the scenes, the company has spent the past few years re-engineering its systems around AI and automation. Its proprietary platform now draws on fifty years of brand-growth data across 14,000 brands – from creative performance to media effectiveness. “Anyone can build tech,” says Greenspoon. “What matters is what you train it on. And we’ve got decades of evidence for what actually makes brands grow.”

That foundation lets Kantar go beyond reporting and into strategy. “We believe in the connection between brand value and enterprise value,” he explains. “Too many conversations are about efficiency. We want to be the effectiveness layer that helps CMOs show their CFOs exactly what brand investment delivers.”

He points to the fast-emerging world of retail media as a prime example. “It’s the wild west,” he says. “Right now, there’s no consistent way to plan or measure across retailers and platforms. We’re building a system that uses our measurement data and analytics to normalize planning so marketers can invest smarter and prove it.”

For Greenspoon, that mix of platform and consultancy defines Kantar’s future. The company’s AI-native tools are now used by around 70% of its clients, while more than 80% of staff use the firm’s internal Copilot system weekly. “We’ve moved from bespoke research to an integrated platform plus advisory model,” he says. “We’re out of beta and into scale and acceleration.”

The American basecamp is part of that acceleration. “Global brand decisions are made here. Our global CEO, our global client officer, our global product officer – all now based around New York. We’re here to play in the North American market like we’ve never played before.”

That move westward is also personal. When Greenspoon joined Kantar in August, his wife was due to give birth within weeks. He disclosed it during the hiring process and the company encouraged him to take paternity leave early on. “It was the best possible start. They told me to learn the business, meet clients and then take time with the baby. It gave me the chance to really understand the company before diving in.”

He believes that same empathy should define Kantar’s approach to clients. “We’ll always be evidence-based. That’s non-negotiable. But the question is how we use that truth to unlock growth. That’s where my agency background helps. We know the craft, but we also know how to move fast.”

As for Kantar’s own brand, Greenspoon is intent on practicing what he preaches. “The number-one rule of growth is being meaningfully different – and being meaningfully different to more people. We’ll show up in new places with new products and we’ll focus more on outcomes than on capabilities.”

He insists Kantar now offers something competitors can’t: a connected model spanning brand, creative, media and commerce. “None of them link the marketing value chain end-to-end. We can see how media predisposes brand, how brand affects media, how creative influences both. It’s all in one data model.”

It’s a confident claim and one he’s happy to demonstrate. “We don’t just tell people – we show them. We’ll open up the browser, run their creative through our tool and prove it. That’s what changes conversations.”

With Zwillenberg now at the helm globally and Greenspoon leading in the Americas, Kantar’s direction is clear: data-driven, AI-powered and growth-obsessed. The company that once measured the world’s brands now wants to help them grow – and it’s doing it from a new headquarters, on a new continent, with a new playbook.",The Drum,2025-10-23T14:06:00Z,https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/10/23/kantar-s-jeff-greenspoon-growth-ai-why-company-s-center-gravity-shifting-west,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:23:02.133995

US existing home sales rise to seven-month high in September,"By Lucia Mutikani

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. existing home sales increased to a seven-month high in September, but rising economic uncertainty and a stalled labor market could limit the boost from easing mortgage rates.

Home sales rose 1.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units, the highest level since February, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales would advance to a rate of 4.06 million units. Sales increased in the Northeast, South and West regions, but declined in the Midwest. Home sales jumped 4.1% on a year-over-year basis.

""As anticipated, falling mortgage rates are lifting home sales,"" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. ""Improving housing affordability is also contributing to the increase in sales.""

The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is near a one-year low of 6.27% after surging to 7.04% in January, data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac showed. Mortgage rates have eased after the Federal Reserve resumed cutting interest rates to shore up the labor market.

A U.S. government shutdown resulting from a funding standoff in Congress has delayed the release of official economic data, including the closely watched employment report for September. But independent reports, including the U.S. central bank's ""Beige Book,"" have sketched a picture of muted hiring. Economists have blamed the lack of hiring on economic uncertainty stemming from import tariffs.

Some realtors also have said the shutdown is delaying contract closings as prospective buyers in flood-prone regions are unable to get necessary insurance. The National Flood Insurance Program, which helps to provide coverage for properties in high-risk areas, has suspended services during the shutdown.

The inventory of existing homes shot up last month by 14.0% to 1.550 million units from a year ago. It, however, remains below the levels that prevailed before the COVID-19 pandemic.

MEDIAN HOME PRICE INCREASES

The median existing home price last month increased 2.1% from a year ago to $415,200. At September's sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to exhaust the current inventory of existing homes, up from 4.2 months a year ago.

A four-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Properties typically stayed on the market for 33 days last month, compared to 28 days a year ago. First-time buyers accounted for 30% of sales, up from 26% a year ago. Economists and realtors say a 40% share in this category is needed for a robust housing market.

All-cash sales constituted 30% of transactions, unchanged from a year ago.

Distressed sales, including foreclosures, made up 2% of transactions, holding steady from a year ago.

College Football Week 9 Betting Report: Bettors Ready to Board Vandy Train,"With Vanderbilt facing traditional powerhouses such as Alabama and LSU, it’s been difficult to attract the public betting masses. A historic season and a charismatic quarterback weren’t enough.

""In the Vanderbilt-Alabama game, we still needed Vandy. And in Vandy-LSU, we really needed Vanderbilt,"" Caesars Sports head of football trading Joey Feazel said.

But in college football Week 9 odds, the tables will likely turn, as the 10th-ranked Commodores host No. 15 Missouri.

Bookmakers and sharp bettors offer their insights on Missouri vs. Vanderbilt and other big matchups, as we dive into this week’s college football betting nuggets.

This page may contain affiliate links to legal sports betting partners. If you sign up or place a wager, FOX Sports may be compensated. Read more about Sports Betting on FOX Sports.

Dandy Vandy

As Feazel said, in last week’s LSU-Vanderbilt showdown, Caesars needed the Commodores to win and cover as 1.5-point home favorites. That’s because the Tigers are always well bet, particularly in the Louisiana market.

QB Diego Pavia and Vandy boosted bookmakers with a 31-24 victory. The Commodores improved to 6-1 straight up (SU)/5-2 against the spread (ATS) and are certainly entrenched in the SEC chase.

Caesars opened Vanderbilt as 1.5-point home favorites against Missouri (6-1 SU/5-2 ATS), and within minutes on Sunday, the line jumped to -2.5. Vanderbilt even got to -3 for about 24 hours, from late Sunday afternoon to late Monday afternoon. The Commodores have since been -2.5 for Saturday’s 3:30 p.m. ET kickoff.

Bettors are ready to get on board the Vandy train, starting with Saturday’s 3:30 p.m. ET contest.

""Vanderbilt will start seeing public money now that it’s not facing blue bloods,"" Feazel said Wednesday afternoon. ""The public is certainly intrigued this week. There’s heavy action on the spread for Vanderbilt.

""Besides Pavia, the Commodores have a pretty good defense. They’re holding back teams that in the past would’ve run over Vanderbilt.""

So finally, Caesars will be rooting against the Commodores.

""We’re gonna need Mizzou this week. I can confidently say that,"" Feazel said.

College Football Rocks on FOX

The Big Noon Kickoff on FOX features another surprising team: Indiana, now ranked No. 2 in the country, which no one would’ve forecast in preseason. The Hoosiers (7-0 SU/4-3 ATS) got a signature win at Oregon in Week 7, 30-20, and followed with an easy 38-13 home victory vs. Michigan State.

But upstart UCLA wants to crash the party for the second time this season. After an 0-4 start — and the firing of coach DeShaun Foster following the third loss — the Bruins (3-4 SU and ATS) are on a three-game upswing.

The first of those wins was arguably the upset of the year. UCLA was a 24.5-point home underdog to Penn State and posted an improbable 42-37 victory.

In college football Week 9 odds, UCLA is an even bigger underdog. Caesars opened Indiana as a 23.5-point home favorite, quickly went to -24/-24.5 on Sunday, then went to -25.5 on Monday.

""Indiana is obviously riding high, and UCLA is just another really fun story,"" Feazel said in assessing this noon ET Saturday clash. ""We’ve seen a little bit of UCLA money. There is a spark with this team.

""The problem is that Indiana can really run up the score, and the Hoosiers are not gonna rest on their laurels. We see Indiana money from the public every week now.""

On Campus Sharp Side

College football betting expert Paul Stone got there in Week 8 with Alabama -8 vs. Tennessee, as the Crimson Tide notched a 37-20 victory. In Week 9, Stone is going back to the SEC well, backing one of the best stories of the season.

Vanderbilt and Missouri harbor not only SEC Championship hopes, but berths in the 12-team College Football Playoff. Stone believes Vanderbilt has a significant advantage at quarterback, siding with the fiery Pavia over Missouri signal-caller Beau Pribula.

""Pavia just has that ‘It’ factor that few possess,"" Stone said. ""Vanderbilt is 14-6 against the spread since Pavia showed up in Nashville. Pribula is still a work in progress and has thrown two interceptions in each of his last two games.""

So Stone’s money is on Vandy -2.5.

""I like Vanderbilt and see the Commodores winning by a touchdown or more.""

More Must-See SEC TV

Texas A&M (7-0 SU/3-4 ATS) might have the inside track to the SEC Championship Game, with a perfect overall record that includes a 4-0 mark in the SEC. But the Aggies have three road games remaining, all against ranked opponents.

That starts with Saturday’s 7:30 p.m. ET kickoff at No. 20 LSU (5-2 SU/3-4 ATS). The Tigers are up against it, having lost two of their last three, including the aforementioned setback at Vanderbilt.

Caesars opened A&M as a 2-point road favorite and is up to -2.5 on Wednesday night.

""Texas A&M has been under the radar, not necessarily a public darling,"" Feazel said. ""We’ll see a little more A&M money this week, with how LSU is playing. But there will be two-way action. The LSU faithful will come in.

""It’s a tough place to play. LSU needs this one badly, and the Tigers will be going all in.""

Wall Street drifts as gains for oil companies make up for Tesla’s and IBM’s losses,"By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose to the cusp of their records on Thursday, as oil prices jumped after President Donald Trump announced “massive” new sanctions on Russia’s crude industry.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and crept back within 0.2% of its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 144 points, or 0.3%, and finished just below its own record set earlier this week, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%.

Companies in the oil and gas business led the way, including gains of 1.1% for Exxon Mobil, 3.1% for ConocoPhillips and 3.4% for Diamondback Energy. They rose with prices for crude, which leaped roughly 5.5% after Trump announced sanctions against Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil.

The hope is to convince Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to end the brutal war with Ukraine, and sanctions could constrict the global flow of oil. The jumps helped oil prices recover some of their sharp recent losses, taken because of expectations for supplies of crude in inventories to remain plentiful. Oil prices are still down more than 10% for the year so far.

Also helping to drive the stock market higher were strong profit reports from several big U.S. companies, as the reporting season ramps up for their profits during the summer. The majority are topping Wall Street’s forecasts, as is usually the case.

Dow jumped 12.9%, and Las Vegas Sands rallied 12.4% after both delivered stronger earnings than analysts expected. Tesla shook off an early loss to climb 2.3% after reporting a weaker profit but also stronger revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

The pressure is on companies broadly to deliver solid growth in profits. That would counter criticism that their stock prices shot too high following a 35% romp for the S&P 500 from a low in April.

On the losing end of Wall Street, Molina Healthcare tumbled 17.5% after its profit for the latest quarter fell well short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Joseph Zubretsky cited a challenging environment for medical costs, and insurers across the industry have been warning about rising medical costs throughout the year.

IBM fell 0.9%, despite reporting better profit and revenue than analysts expected. Wall Street focused instead on weaker-than-expected results for its Red Hat business, which provides open-source software products.

All told, the S&P 500 rose 39.04 points to 6,738.44. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 144.20 to 46,734.61, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 201.40 to 22,941.80.

In the gold market, prices strengthened to halt a sharp recent slide. The price for an ounce climbed 2% to $4,145.60 per ounce.

It had dropped sharply the last two days after setting its latest all-time high, as momentum suddenly gave out following what’s been a stunning year. The price of gold has jumped about 57% so far in 2025.

Many of the factors that have sent gold on its monumental rise are still around, including concerns about the mountains of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are amassing. The U.S. government’s gross national debt topped $38 trillion on Wednesday, and the worry is that a continued acceleration will only worsen inflation.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.00% from 3.97% late Wednesday. That was ahead of a report coming on Friday that will show how much inflation U.S. consumers felt during September. The report was initially due earlier this month but was delayed because of the U.S. government’s shutdown.

If the reading ends up benign, it could encourage the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates in hopes of giving the slowing job market a boost. It delivered its first cut of the year last month, but it’s been wary of promising many more because lower rates can make inflation worse.

In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across Europe following a more mixed finish in Asia.

Stocks rose 0.7% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai as leaders in Beijing wrapped up an important Communist Party meeting to set the agenda for the coming five years. The party said afterward that it will focus on speeding up self-reliance in science and technology.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.4%, and South Korea’s Kospi sank 1% for two of the world’s larger losses.

US home sales accelerated in September to their fastest pace since February as mortgage rates eased,"Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes accelerated in September as declining mortgage rates and a pickup in available properties on the market encouraged home shoppers.

Existing home sales rose 1.5% last month from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.06 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That’s the fastest sales pace since February.

Sales jumped 4.1% compared with September last year. The latest sales figure came in slightly below the roughly 4.07 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.

The national median sales price climbed 2.1% in September from a year earlier to $415,200. That’s the 27th consecutive month that home prices have risen on an annual basis and the highest median sales price for any September on data going back to 1999.

“The home sales in September showed an increase, but I would not characterize (it) as a breakout,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “It does show that consumers do respond to lower mortgage rates.”

The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.

Mortgage rates started declining in July in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve’s decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.

Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in July and August, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.75% to 6.56%, according to Freddie Mac. The decline in mortgage rates accelerated in September and continued month, pulling the average rate down this week to its lowest level in more than a year.

While lower rates boost home shoppers' purchasing power, borrowing costs remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home following years of skyrocketing prices. The U.S. median home sales price has risen 53% over the past six years, before the housing market superheated during the initial years of the pandemic.

Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates have benefited from a wider selection of properties on the market, which has brought supply and demand more into balance.

There were 1.55 million unsold homes at the end of last month, up 1.3% from August and up 14% from September last year, NAR said. The latest inventory snapshot matches a 5-year high, but remains well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic.",Yahoo Entertainment,2025-10-23T14:04:09Z,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-home-sales-accelerated-september-140409835.html,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:23:15.177064

Apollo considers sale of Hispanic grocer Heritage Grocers Group,"US private equity company Apollo Global Management is exploring the sale of its Hispanic grocery chain, Heritage Grocers Group.

The move comes as concerns over mass deportations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have prompted Heritage’s core Hispanic customers to exercise greater caution over their shopping habits, dampening consumer demand within Latino communities across the US, as reported by Reuters.

Apollo could secure $1.5bn from the potential sale and has engaged investment bank UBS to manage the process.

Heritage Grocers generates $150m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and records more than $2bn in annual revenue.

Apollo and UBS declined to comment on Reuters’ inquiries, while Heritage Grocers also did not respond to requests for comment.

The company operates several Hispanic-focused grocery banners, including El Rancho Supermercado, Cardenas Markets and Tony’s Fresh Market.

Apollo acquired Tony’s from its founding family and Cardenas from private equity firm KKR in 2022, merging the two.

It purchased El Rancho in 2023.

Heritage Grocers currently operates 115 stores across Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Nevada and Texas.

Apollo has made various investments in the grocery sector, including The Fresh Market, Sprouts Farmers Market, Smart & Final and Albertsons.",Retail-insight-network.com,2025-10-23T14:03:53Z,https://www.retail-insight-network.com/news/apollo-sale-heritage-grocers-group/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:23:21.440891

European markets rise after major earnings reports; Gucci-owner Kering surges 9%,"Brendan McDermid | Reuters

LONDON — European stocks ended Thursday in positive territory as investors looked to earnings reports for clues on business activity and confidence in the region.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed the session up 0.4%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index added 0.7%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.2%, and Italy's FTSE MIB also saw gains of 0.4%. Germany's DAX also edged higher, ending up 0.3%.

It was a busy day for earnings in Europe with Kering , Roche Holding , Unilever , Vinci , Thales , LSEG , Dassault Systemes , Antofagasta , Swedbank, Nokia and Lloyds Banking Group among the big names reporting third-quarter figures.

Enterprise software firm SAP released earnings late on Wednesday, which missed analyst expectations. The German company reported a 7% increase in revenue for the third quarter of 9.08 billion euros ($10.53 billion), below expectations of 9.15 billion euros ($7.96 billion), according to consensus figures compiled by LSEG.

However, it saw gains of 22% in its cloud revenue, with CEO Christian Klein putting it down to increasing AI and data cloud market share.

""For Q4 we are executing against a strong pipeline - which gives us confidence in our accelerating total revenue growth ambition for 2026,"" he said in a statement. SAP's shares ended the session up 2.2%.

Gucci-owner Kering also reported after the bell on Wednesday. The group's revenue totaled 3.4 billion euros in the quarter, down 5% on a comparable basis but it beat expectations of 3.31 billion euros, per a consensus compiled by FactSet. Gucci sales — which typically make up close to half of Kering's total revenues — came in just shy of forecasts at 1.3 billion euros, down 14% on a comparable basis on the year before. Its shares closed 8.7% higher.

Stock Chart IconStock chart icon

In financial services, Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday reported pre-tax profit of almost £1.2 billion, slightly higher than consensus estimates of about £1 billion, but down from the £1.8 billion of the same period last year. It comes after the British lender announced earlier this month an additional £800 million charge relating to customer compensation arising from the U.K. car finance misselling scandal. Its shares were up 1.2% at the closing bell.

Shares in Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) lost 0.1% as its net interest income reached 10.4 billion Swedish krona during the third quarter, beating the 10.2 Swedish krona predicted by analysts. The bank's quarterly-earnings report showed net profits of 7.68 billion Swedish krona for the three-month period, missing the 7.86 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts, according to LSEG estimates.

Swedbank reported pre-tax profits of 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above the 9.4 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts. Shares in the Stockholm-listed lender — which has a strong presence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — fell 0.2% on the day. The bank saw net interest income reach 10.8 billion Swedish krona, above analyst estimates of 10.7 billion Swedish krona.

Attention turns to energy

Oil prices were in focus Thursday after they jumped around 3% in the previous session when the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The commodity was up by more than 5% in afternoon trade.

The administration cited Moscow's ""lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.""

European Union member states also approved new sanctions on Russia on Wednesday, to be formally adopted today, including a ban on liquefied natural gas imports further as the bloc ramps up efforts to decouple its energy supply from Russian oil and gas.

""We really want to deprive Russia of the means to fund this war to end this war,"" Kaja Kallas, European Union high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and vice president of the European Commission, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

The continent has made progress on this, Kallas noted, but ""not all the member states are there,"" she said. ""So the criticism that we have heard, also from the United States, regarding some of our member states still buying oil and gas, it's very relevant,"" she added.

Kallas spoke ahead of an EU leaders' summit on Thursday, where further measures will be discussed. Brussels will also discuss using frozen Russian assets as a reparations loan to support Ukraine.

Broader Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell, tracking Wall Street's declines on Wednesday on concerns about U.S.-China trade relations. Trade fears resurfaced after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is considering curbs on exports to China that are made with U.S. software, citing a U.S. official and three people briefed by U.S. authorities.

U.S. stock markets were in positive territory as investors digested quarterly earnings releases that came out after the previous market close, including from Tesla, IBM, Moderna and Lam Research.

"Lower mortgage rates push home sales higher in September, but prices still stubbornly high","Sales of previously owned homes rose 1.5% in September from August to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4.06 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is slightly less than the analysts were forecasting, but the highest pace in seven months.

Sales were 4.1% higher compared with September of last year.

Regionally, on an annual basis, sales were strongest in the South and Northeast. From August, sales were strongest in the West and actually fell slightly in the Midwest, the only region to see a monthly decline.

This count is based on closings, so people signing contracts likely in July and August, when mortgage rates were coming down but were not as low as they are now. The average rate on the 30-year fixed started July at 6.67% and is now at 6.17%, according to Mortgage News Daily.

""As anticipated, falling mortgage rates are lifting home sales,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. ""Improving housing affordability is also contributing to the increase in sales.""

Inventory continued to make gains, up 14% from a year ago to 1.55 million units for sale at the end of September. That is still lean historically. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.6-month supply of homes for sale. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller.

""Inventory is matching a five-year high, though it remains below pre-Covid levels,"" Yun added. ""Many homeowners are financially comfortable, resulting in very few distressed properties and forced sales. Home prices continue to rise in most parts of the country, further contributing to overall household wealth.""

Still tight supply continues to pressure prices. The median price of a home sold in September was $415,200, up 2.1% year over year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. Prices are 53% higher than pre-Covid levels.

Sales continue to see the biggest gains on the high end of the market, likely because of more supply in those tiers. Sales of home priced above $1 million rose 20% from the year before, while sales of homes priced below $100,000 were up just under 3%.

First-time homebuyers are making some gains, likely due to falling mortgage rates. They made up 30% of September sales, up from 26% the year before.

About 30% of sales were made all in cash. Homes are sitting on the market longer, an average 33 days, up from 28 a year ago.",CNBC,2025-10-23T14:02:57Z,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/lower-mortgage-rates-push-home-sales-higher-in-september.html,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:23:32.097333
"Foo Fighters Return With 2026 Stadium Tour, Dates Revealed","Foo Fighters have been dipping their toes in the touring waters of late after taking an extended break from the road, but things are about to pick up in a major way as the band just announced a major North American stadium tour for 2026.

The group will kick off the run Aug. 4 at Toronto's Rogers Stadium with the tour dates set to wrap on Sept. 26 at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium. Joining them on the trek will be Queens of the Stone Age, who will open all dates except the Sept. 12 Fargo stop.

These all came after a handful of late minute surprise show announcements in Southern California and on the East Coast where the band got their feet wet with Rubin behind the kit.

What Else Did Dave Grohl Say About the Tour?

Speaking at length about the inspiration for the upcoming dates, Grohl commented, ""Since our return to the stage in San Luis Obispo five weeks ago, we have been reminded of why we love and are forever devoted to doing this Foo Fighters thing. From reuniting as a band and staring at a list of 30 years worth of songs to brush off, to reimagining versions with the incredible blessing of the one and only Ilan Rubin behind the drums, to reconnecting with our amazing fans and blasting them with everything we’ve got (no matter the size of the venue) because we would not be here without them, we have the most solid core. And the sun is finally rising over the horizon.""

""What better way to share the view than with close friends,"" he continued. ""In 1992 I first saw the legendary Kyuss perform at the Off Ramp in Seattle and met Mr. Josh Homme. The band were friends of a friend and before long their album Blues for the Red Sun became the soundtrack to that summer. 33 years later and with many miles behind us, I have shared some of my life’s most rewarding musical moments with my dear friend, Josh. A lifelong bond that goes far beyond the sound we’ve made together. So it is with great happiness that we can share this next chapter together with his almighty Queens of the Stone Age. Take cover.""

How Did Foo Fighters Tease Their New Tour?

In typical Foo Fighters fashion, the band dropped a dryly humorous video in which they played up the desire to deliver the ""100 percent real, raw, human element of rock 'n' roll"" as AI generated tomfoolery could be spotted throughout the teaser.

""Hey everyone, it's been a while, but I'm happy to announce that Foo Fighters are coming back to bring you that 100 percent real, raw, human element of rock 'n' roll,"" shared Dave Grohl.

Bassist Nate Mendel added, ""After 30 years of being a band, we've realized that the most important thing to us is that what you see and hear coming from our speakers is the genuine passion of the six living, breathing human beings onstage.""

""Because, just as our many heroes before us, at the end of the day we want you to feel that it's true,"" continued guitarist Pat Smear before fellow guitarist Chris Shiflett added, ""So, make no mistake, we've been preparing something special for you, rehearsing tireless to bring you our best from the heart.""

The video concludes with Grohl sharing, ""And wait til you meet our new drummer"" - Grohl, as a 10-armed Ilan Rubin pounds away on multiple drums.

A Message From Foo Fighters

More About Foo Fighters' Return

Foo Fighters took an extended break and largely stayed out of the spotlight following promotion of their But Here We Are album. It was the band's first offering after the death of longtime drummer Taylor Hawkins.

Further complicating things was Dave Grohl's public revelation of fathering a child outside of his marriage and the backlash after the announcement. The group had essentially wound down their touring at the time of the announcement, but called off the one remaining festival appearance they had as Grohl spent time working through issues with his family.

But after dropping out of the public spotlight for a period, Foo Fighters began to move toward a return in early July when they issued ""Today's Song"" to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the group.

A few select dates in other parts of the world were announced and more recently the band's decided to play a handful of surprise shows closer to home in Southern California and then on the East Coast. Now, with the 2026 stadium tour announcement, Foo Fighters seem to be back with a full-on return.",Loudwire,2025-10-23T14:02:37Z,https://loudwire.com/foo-fighters-2026-north-american-stadium-tour-dates/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:23:34.682515
From penny stock to meme frenzy: Is BYND’s 388% rally about to crash hard? Today's market move shows Beyond Meat in trouble,"Synopsis

Beyond Meat (BYND) stock is in turmoil. After a staggering 388% surge last week, pre-market trading on October 23 shows a 20% drop, closing near $2.79. Retail frenzy and a short squeeze fueled the rally, but weak revenues of $326 million in 2024 and a $35 million quarterly loss raise red flags. Analysts warn the meme stock rally may be unsustainable. BYND investors face high volatility and risk of a sharp pullback.

Beyond Meat Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) has become the latest meme stock sensation. The company’s stock soared over 1,400% in a single week, but recent pre-market losses have investors questioning whether the rally can last.

The plant-based meat company faces a sharp pre-market drop of 22%, closing at $2.79 on October 23. Investors are questioning whether the meme stock rally can last.

Between October 16 and 22, 2025, BYND skyrocketed from $0.50 to $7.69, fueled by a short squeeze and massive retail buying. Short interest hit 81.8%, forcing traders betting against the stock to cover. Retail investors poured $35 million into BYND on October 21 alone. Social media hype, particularly from Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets, further accelerated the momentum.

Beyond Meat continues to report declining revenues and sustained losses, with Q2 2025 net revenues falling 19.6% year-over-year to $75.0 million and a net loss of $33.2 million. The company has never achieved annual profitability, and its gross margin dropped to 11.5% in Q2 2025, down from 14.7% the previous year, reflecting ongoing operational inefficiencies. International operations have been scaled back, including a significant reduction in China, adding to restructuring costs. ​

In October 2025, Beyond Meat executed a debt-for-equity swap to refinance over $1.1 billion in convertible notes due in 2027, issuing up to 326 million new shares to bondholders—increasing the total share count by nearly fivefold. This extreme dilution wiped out significant shareholder value, triggering a 56% single-day crash on October 13, 2025, and eroding investor confidence. While the restructuring averted near-term bankruptcy, it severely weakened the equity structure. ​

Live Events

The recent price surge from below $0.50 to over $7 was fueled by retail investor speculation and a short squeeze, not business recovery. High short interest (around 10.5% of float) and inclusion in the Roundhill Meme ETF (MEME) amplified volatility, with trading volumes exceeding 476 million shares in a single day—over 12 times the average. Analysts emphasize that the rally is disconnected from fundamentals and warn against chasing momentum. ​

Analyst price targets reflect deep skepticism: the average 12-month target is $2.27, implying a 36.7% downside from the current price of $3.58, with targets ranging from $0.80 to $4.00. Out of 10 analysts, five rate BYND a 'Strong Sell' and five a 'Hold', with no 'Buy' ratings, underscoring lack of confidence in a turnaround. Forecasts suggest sales will only marginally improve to $311 million by 2028, with continued losses expected. ​

Technical indicators show extreme overbought conditions, with a 14-day RSI of 78.78, and high volatility at 35.64%. The Fear & Greed Index stands at 39 (Fear), indicating cautious sentiment despite the price spike. Pre-market trading on October 23 showed a 20.39% drop, signaling weakening momentum and potential reversal

Financial fundamentals remain weak. Beyond Meat reported 2024 revenue of $326.45 million, down from $343.38 million in 2023, and posted a $35 million quarterly loss. Recent debt restructuring added 326 million new shares, raising dilution concerns.

Analysts remain cautious. The 12-month price target is $2.27, suggesting potential downside of over 36% from the current price.

Why did Beyond Meat stock jump so fast?

The recent spike in BYND shares has surprised many investors. Several factors contributed to the sudden jump:

Retail investor enthusiasm: Social media and online forums have fueled interest in Beyond Meat, turning it into a “meme stock.”

Short squeeze dynamics: Investors betting against BYND were forced to buy shares quickly to cover their positions, pushing the stock higher.

Business developments: New deals and partnerships, especially with retailers, have boosted investor confidence.

In just one day, Beyond Meat’s stock soared by more than 60%. This is not a small move for a company with a market value of only a few billion dollars.

The surge demonstrates the power of retail investors in today’s stock market. Even companies with financial challenges can see dramatic short-term rallies if investor sentiment is high.

How strong is Beyond Meat’s business today?

Beyond Meat’s stock rally is impressive, but the company’s financials tell a different story. Investors need to consider these points:

Revenue vs. debt: Beyond Meat has trailing 12-month revenue of around $360 million. However, its long-term debt exceeds $1.2 billion, more than three times its revenue.

Share dilution: Recent debt-for-equity swaps have increased the number of shares outstanding, reducing the value of existing shares.

Profitability challenges: The company is still struggling to generate consistent profits, which can make the stock more sensitive to market sentiment.

While business expansion and partnerships can provide short-term boosts, the underlying financial risks remain significant.

What is a short squeeze and why does it matter here?

One of the main drivers of Beyond Meat’s stock surge is the short squeeze. But what exactly does that mean?

Short selling explained: Some investors bet that a stock will fall. They borrow shares and sell them, planning to buy them back at a lower price.

Short squeeze effect: When the stock rises instead, these investors rush to buy shares to cover their positions. This pushes the stock price even higher.

Impact on BYND: Beyond Meat’s high short interest means that even a small wave of buying can create large price swings.

Short squeezes can create rapid gains, but they are usually temporary. Investors who enter during a squeeze need to be careful because the price may drop just as quickly as it rose.

Could Beyond Meat stock crash soon?

Beyond Meat stock faces a high risk of crashing soon despite its recent dramatic surge. Beyond Meat has endured years of declining sales since 2022, consistently posting losses, and carries a large debt load despite a recent debt restructuring. Analysts warn that the rally is momentum-driven and speculative, similar to other meme stocks, which typically experience sharp reversals after brief surges.

The stock’s volatility remains extreme. After climbing as high as $7, shares have rapidly dropped in pre-market trading to under $3. Key risks include dilution from recent convertible debt issued to extend loan maturity, ongoing revenue declines, and the absence of profitability or clear growth catalysts. Market experts caution that while retail enthusiasm may push prices higher short-term, Beyond Meat stock is more likely to face an 80% or greater crash due to its poor financial health and high dilution risk.

While the surge has created excitement, the risk of a crash is real. Here are the key warning signs:

High debt load: With more debt than revenue, the company may face difficulties in funding operations if investor sentiment changes.

Unstable market sentiment: Meme stock rallies are often driven by hype rather than fundamentals. Prices can drop sharply if interest fades.

Share dilution: More shares in circulation can lower the value of existing holdings, impacting investors’ returns.

Investors should understand that Beyond Meat’s stock is volatile. The rapid gains are exciting, but long-term stability is not guaranteed.

How can investors approach BYND stock?

For those considering Beyond Meat as an investment, caution is key. Here are some strategies:

Short-term traders: Those looking for quick gains may benefit from the volatility, but must be ready to exit fast.

Long-term investors: Should monitor the company’s debt levels, profitability, and market expansion before committing.

Diversification: Avoid putting too much capital into a single volatile stock. Spread risk across multiple investments.

Investors should stay informed, watch the news, and consider using stop-loss orders to manage potential losses.

Fantasy Football Sleepers: Tez Johnson among top hidden gems for Week 8 following Mike Evans injury,"We're all looking for that hidden gem to give our fantasy football team an edge, so we can kick back and relax on Sundays while gleefully watching our squad march to victory. Let Scott Pianowski help you rest easy this season with his top sleepers.

[Upgrade to Fantasy Plus and gain your edge in player projections and much more]

Week 7 was a solid week in the sleeper streets, as Oronde Gadsden II smashed, Kayshon Boutte scored again and Cade Otton was useful on Monday night. Let’s see if we can keep the momentum rolling this week, especially with six NFL teams out of action.

Advertisement

WR Tez Johnson at Saints (46% rostered on Yahoo)

Johnson might be an obvious pick to start with, but often the wisdom of crowds is correct. He's spiked in two straight weeks and had a season-best nine targets at Detroit. With Mike Evans out for months and Chris Godwin Jr. rehabbing slowly, Johnson becomes a priority target for Tampa Bay.

WR Alec Pierce vs. Titans (24%)

If Josh Downs is able to return, Pierce’s market share will likely take a hit. But Pierce is also coming off a snappy 5-98-0 line against the Chargers, and the Colts like to take deep shots to Pierce every week. At this point, any potential add in the Indianapolis passing game sounds good to me.

Advertisement

WR Troy Franklin vs. Cowboys (28%)

His Week 7 touchdown was a stone fluke, a lucky bounce from a deflection, but we can’t ignore that Franklin is up to 11 red-zone targets for the year. He’s also caught a couple of two-point conversions, underscoring his goal-line equity. Bo Nix and Franklin showed chemistry at Oregon, and that’s starting to translate in the NFL. And obviously the Dallas defense is a dream matchup.

TE Theo Johnson at Eagles (22%)

He’s collected four touchdowns in his last four games, and he’s also seen nine red-zone targets this year, third at the tight end position. It’s obvious Jaxson Dart trusts Johnson in confined spaces, so there’s touchdown equity at play on Sunday.

Advertisement

QB Joe Flacco vs. Jets (40%)

Age is just a number for Cincinnati’s temporary quarterback — he was good against Green Bay and outstanding against the Steelers. Now Flacco takes dead aim at a winless Jets defense that might be without cover ace Sauce Gardner (concussion).

RB Kyle Monangai at Ravens (36%)

Monangai saw a season-best 15 touches in the win over the Saints, turning them into 94 total yards and a score. Ben Johnson would love to create a two-headed backfield in Chicago, and an injury-plagued Baltimore defense has been ripped against the run all season.

TE Dawson Knox at Panthers (1%)

This call is directly tied to Dalton Kincaid and his oblique injury; if Kincaid is cleared, Knox is a no-go. But Knox did sneak a touchdown in Buffalo’s last game and the Carolina seam coverage has been awful for two straight years.

'No free lunch': Covered call ETFs have high yields but come with a trade-off Back to video

Article content

Prerna Mathews, vice-president of ETF product strategy at Mackenzie Investments, said covered call ETFs typically invest in dividend-paying equities and further enhance income by writing call options on those holdings. A call option provides the right to purchase a security at a set price. She said covered call ETFs essentially earn option premiums in exchange for “giving up” some of the stock’s future gains beyond the set option price.

Article content

Article content

She noted covered call ETFs have flourished in the market recently, fuelled by investor enthusiasm for their higher yields. Mathews said these products can be attractive to those who prioritize income over growth and help manage market volatility.

Article content

“There’s definitely a trade-off; there’s no free lunch. The higher yield off the options premiums is coming off of the fact that you are giving up long-term return in the stock,” Mathews said.

Article content

“Those options premiums, you’re getting paid out on them today, but that total return impact is usually much more significant than the yield that you’re actually generating off of them.”

Article content

Mathews said there is more onus on investors to do due diligence and not get “distracted by a flashy yield number and marketing material.”

Article content

Fred Masters, president of Masters Money Management Inc., said the best way to view these products is to think of them as “enhanced income products” that use options strategies to boost their yields.

Article content

He said retail investors shouldn’t base their portfolios around these products, pointing to higher fees and lower overall returns. Though he said they can work as a smaller part of a larger portfolio.

Article content

Article content

Masters highlighted that management fees for these products can be “up to ten times higher” than a typical ETF in the same category.

Article content

“You can’t control outcomes in many cases when investing in equity markets, but you can control costs and keeping costs to a minimum year after year is a crucial tenet of long-term investing success,” he said.

Article content

“We know these covered call ETFs are expensive and that eats into returns annually.”

Article content

Covered call ETFs can perform better under certain market conditions though, according to Nick Hearne, a financial adviser and portfolio manager at RGF Integrated Wealth Management.

Article content

In a range-bound market, where stocks are moderately increasing, and in declining markets, he said covered call ETFs will often outperform traditional strategies due to the income investors receive.

Article content

“Where they’re going to underperform is when the market increases significantly over a period of time … what they’re really doing is when they sell those call options, they’re selling their upside. That’s the downside,” Hearne said.",Financial Post,2025-10-23T14:02:11Z,https://financialpost.com/pmn/no-free-lunch-covered-call-etfs-have-high-yields-but-come-with-a-trade-off,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:23:40.273410

WPP cuts out the agency to help brands create their own ads with AI,"In this article:

By Paul Sandle

LONDON (Reuters) -British ad group WPP said on Thursday it was letting brands access its AI-powered marketing platform to plan, create and publish their own campaigns.

WPP Open Pro, a new edition of its AI platform WPP Open, has been designed for smaller brands that do not use full-service agencies, it said, as well as to provide new capabilities to existing clients.

Advertising groups are facing the challenge of brands starting to use AI to do more of their own creative and planning work, reducing the fees they pay to agencies.

WPP has appointed Cindy Rose to turn it around after it lost its crown as the world's biggest ad group to French rival Publicis last year and its shares more than halved this year.

The company, which owns Ogilvy, AKQA and WPP Media, said it was the first of its peers to provide a range of integrated, AI-powered delivery models, including directly to clients.

Rose, who took over from Mark Read last month, said WPP's creative and strategic talent would always be at the heart of what it did for the world's biggest brands, such as Coca-Cola.

But technology was fundamentally reshaping the industry, she said, and the new platform would put its AI capabilities into the hands of a much wider array of brands and businesses.

""This is about transforming how marketing is delivered, expanding our total addressable market, and giving more brands the tools they need to lead in the AI era,"" she said.

The platform will enable brands to create channel-specific ads in seconds, it said.

For example, a coffee shop chain could combine brand-approved imagery with content generated by AI to create a campaign for a new store opening.

The ad could then be dropped into WPP's Open Media Studio to be published or it could be published directly to major platforms, WPP said.

"Bitcoin Is the CIA’s Greatest Scam, Claims Tucker Carlson","Tucker Carlson has reignited one of Bitcoin’s most charged debates—privacy, provenance, and the politics wrapped around the origin—by telling an audience on his “This Is The Turning Point” tour that he believes the asset traces back to the US intelligence community. Pressed during an open-mic Q&A on whether he invests in Bitcoin and whether he views it as a viable asset, Carlson said he supports the principle of financial self-determination but fears what he describes as a widening gap between the ideal and the implementation.

Bitcoin Is Not Private

“I love the idea of Bitcoin because I love the idea of financial autonomy,” he said, framing his stance in civil-liberties terms rather than price speculation. “I don’t want what I buy or sell to be tracked. I don’t want my money to be tracked. It’s nobody’s business.” Carlson, who noted he has spoken at multiple Bitcoin events—“I spoke at the Bitcoin conference actually last year… I’ve spoken at a couple of Bitcoin conferences”—cast himself as philosophically aligned with the original cypherpunk promise while distancing himself from the market’s practical realities.

The fulcrum of his critique is surveillance. “It turns out that it is not, to this point… a way to conduct financial transactions privately at all. And that really freaks me out,” he said. He extended that worry to the broader rise of digital money, warning that programmable account restrictions could be used as instruments of political discipline. “I’m really afraid of a digital currency because that is totalitarian in control. If you can punish people, if you can zero out their bank account and keep them from eating, you will have total obedience. That’s totalitarian.”

Carlson’s skepticism is not directed at BTC’s aspirations alone; he tied it to generational economics and political economy. He argued that young Americans, “completely screwed in the job market,” have turned to crypto as an upward-mobility vehicle.

He said he hopes that promise pans out—“I’m praying for them. I hope that’s true”—but warned it could devolve into a familiar alliance of “financial beneficiaries” and “the politicians they control.” As he put it: “I fear that it will become, like so many other things in our country, a scam of sorts run by a coalition of the financial beneficiaries… and the politicians they control who use it to further their control of American society.”

On portfolio choices, Carlson was categorical: “I’m a gold buyer, and I’ve been vindicated big time in that… It was good enough for the Phoenicians. It’s good enough for me.” He framed his approach as a discipline of staying within his circle of competence: “In general, don’t get involved in anything I don’t understand… I try to limit myself to things I understand.”

Who Created Bitcoin?

The sharpest provocation came when the question turned to Satoshi Nakamoto. For Carlson, the pseudonymous creator—and the unmoved early coins commonly attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto—remain a decisive obstacle.

“Nobody can explain to me who Satoshi was, the creator of Bitcoin, this mysterious guy who apparently died, but nobody knows who he was,” he said, before delivering the claim that will dominate headlines: “You know, I grew up in D.C. primarily, in a government family. So CIA. That’s my guess. Can’t prove it.”

Related Reading: Bitcoin Is ‘Like Electronic Gold,’ Says Federal Reserve Governor Waller

He pressed the point as an investor’s threshold question: “You’re telling me to invest in something whose founder is, like, mysterious and has billions of dollars of unused Bitcoin. Like, what is that? And no one can answer the question, including some of the biggest holders of Bitcoin in the world, who I know personally. They’re like, oh, it doesn’t matter. What matters to me? Right?”

Carlson’s remarks interweave several long-running Bitcoin controversies. First is Bitcoin’s privacy model. Bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous; transaction histories are globally replicated and auditable by default, which is why surveillance concerns coexist with arguments that transparency is an integrity feature.

Second is origin risk: the unresolved identity of Satoshi, the status of the early-mined coins that have not moved, and the governance implications of dormant supply suddenly entering circulation. Carlson elevates origin risk from a philosophical curiosity to a non-starter for capital allocation.

For context, this is not the first time Carlson has floated the intelligence-origin theory around Bitcoin. At a private gathering during the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in late July 2024, he similarly speculated that “obviously, it was the CIA,” adding, “I think we all know that,” when pressed on Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity.

At press time, Bitcoin traded at $108,729.

Built-In Batteries: a Daft Idea With an Uncertain Future,"Having a gadget’s battery nestled snugly within the bowels of a device has certain advantages. It finally solves the ‘no batteries included’ problem, and there is no more juggling of AA or AAA cells, nor their respective chargers. Instead each device is paired to that one battery that is happily charged using a standardized USB connector, and suddenly everything is well in the world.

Everything, except for the devices that cannot be used while charging, wireless devices that are suddenly dragging along a wire while charging and which may have charging ports in irrational locations, as well as devices that would work quite well if it wasn’t for that snugly embedded battery that’s now dead, dying, or on fire.

Marrying devices with batteries in this manner effectively means tallying up all the disadvantages of the battery chemistries and their chargers, adding them to the device’s feature list, and limiting their effective lifespan in the process. It also prevents the rapid swapping with fresh batteries, which is why everyone is now lugging chunky powerbanks around instead of spare batteries, and hogging outlets with USB chargers. And the task of finding a replacement for non-standardized pouch cell batteries can prove to be hard or impossible.

Looking at the ‘convenience’ argument from this way makes one wonder whether it is all just marketing that we’re being sold. Especially in light of the looming 2027 EU regulation on internal batteries that is likely to wipe out the existence of built-in batteries with an orbital legal strike. Are we about to say ‘good riddance’ to a terrible idea?

Not Very Pro

To further rub in how much of a terrible idea built-in batteries are, one only has to look at professional equipment, particularly in the audiovisual world. Whether we are talking about DSLRs, mirror-less cameras, or professional video cameras, they all have as standard feature the ability to quickly swap batteries. Nikon and Canon cameras use a range of proprietary-but-standard Li-ion batteries, with Sony’s video camera batteries also used on portable studio lighting. For the super-expensive Red video cameras you can use either the massive Redvolt batteries that dangle off the side or a power adapter.

The reasoning here is simple: when you are doing a photo or film shoot you do not have time for charging, so you load up with a stash of charged batteries beforehand. As the current battery becomes drained, you pop open the battery hatch or detach the current pack and slam in a fresh battery before resuming. During moments of downtime you can put the drained batteries on the charger that you have squirreled away somewhere. This way you stay wireless and charged with zero fuss, and if you have enough batteries, zero downtime.

Even within the era of budget photo and video cameras you’d be able to do this. When it comes to my own JVC camcorder and Canon IXUS 100 IS point-and-shoot camera, both offer this feature, even if the battery swapping experience doesn’t feel as premium as with the Nikon D7200 DSLR and its EN-EL15 batteries that is used for more serious occasions. Swapping batteries with the DSLR in particular is as easy as swapping SD cards, which is to say a matter of seconds.

One might get the idea here that the main reason to stuff a pouch cell somewhere inside the device is mostly a cost-saving measure, as it omits the battery terminals and ejection mechanism for the pack.

Battery Decay

Another reason why having a built-in battery with a multi-thousand-Euro DSLR would be a terrible idea beyond the insanity of having to ‘charge the DSLR’, is that the battery will be dead long before even the warranty on the DSLR has expired, especially if you are an avid shooter. Even if you do not use a device that much, the fact of the matter is that lithium-ion cells begin to degrade as soon as they have been manufactured. This may be acceptable in a €1,000+ smartphone when people buy a new one every other year anyway, but becomes a problem when you’d like to use a device for much longer.

A good summary of the how and why of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) can be found in this IEEE review article by Wiljan Vermeer et al. from 2021. The three main aging mechanisms are:

Loss of Lithium Inventory (LLI).

Loss of Active Material (LAM).

Conductivity Loss (CL).

There are multiple ways in which each type of aging can occur, with most requiring the cell to be charged and discharged, as this inflicts mechanical and other types of stress. When it comes to storing LIBs, we enter the territory of calendar aging. This has an irreversible and reversible component, the former being impacted by three components: the state of charge (SoC), temperature, and time.

What this tells us is that although you can affect LIB calendar aging, it’s a pretty inevitable aspect of their chemistry. This is true even in the case of the lithium-polymer (LiPo) LIB type batteries with its polymer electrolyte. This effectively means that charging the battery in a device to 80% instead of 100% will give it some more life, but you’d have to drop down to 50% or less to see the big gains. It’s also highly advisable to keep the battery relatively cool, which is where fast-charging is a terrible idea, especially as the resistance of the battery goes up due to aging.

While the exact mechanisms behind calendar aging are still being investigated, it’s likely that the layer that forms at the electrochemically unstable electrolyte-electrode interface (SEI) restructures to prevent the transfer of lithium ions, effectively increasing the measured resistance via the CL aging path.

In addition to calendar aging you have the charge-discharge cycle-based aging mechanisms, which not only affects the SEI, but also causes mechanical expansion of the graphite anode material, which leads to both the LLI and LAM aging paths. When you then add in the typical charging method for gadgets like smartphones using a LIB-based powerbank, you end up with double the charge-discharge cycles over simply slotting in a fresh battery.

End Of The Road

Beyond larger electronic devices, pouch cell LIBs are now integrated in countless more gadgets, from lamps to Bluetooth speakers. To address the sheer volume of these built-in LIBs, the EU’s Battery Regulation will begin to enforce its removability and replaceability requirements starting on 18 February of 2027.

The batteries which we discussed in this article fall under so-called ‘portable batteries’, meaning that it weighs less than 5 kg and is not used for an electric vehicle. These are required to make it possible for the end user to replace and remove, all without damaging or destroying the battery or the device, and without requiring any special tools. There are some partial safety-related exceptions where a professional can do said replacement, while a full exception is limited to a number of very specific device categories.

What exactly the fallout of this change will be remains to be seen, with manufacturers likely starting to adapt their products throughout 2026. Devices like smartphones, game controllers, but also Bluetooth speakers, wireless mice and portable game consoles will all be affected, so it’ll be interesting to see what approach we will see here.

Perhaps most of all what it might mean for standardization of cells and batteries, as every device that’s put on the market in the EU must have spare batteries available for reasonable cost for five years after it stops being sold. Clearly this would be cheaper if the same battery just got used for decades, somewhat like the veritable AA cell and today’s 18650 and similar formats.

So Many Standards

The process of standardization is a rough one, with sometimes the legislature leaning into the issue after consultation with a requirement, as with USB-based chargers. Other times the market simply picks something that’s readily available and does the job. One example of this is the Nokia BL-5C battery and its variations, which was quite prevalent due to Nokia using it for its phones and other platforms like the N-Gage. Consequently third-party manufacturers made their own compatible versions for use in a wide range of devices.

While the BL-5C is still fairly large, at 53 mm x 34 mm and a thickness of 6 mm, point and shoot cameras as well as action cameras feature a range of smaller batteries, with the Canon NB-4L as used in the IXUS point and shoot cameras providing more than 750 mAh in a 35 mm x 40 mm package and a similar 5.9 mm thickness. The third-party replacements that I got of the NB-4L claim to provide 1,200 mAh, as modern LIBs tend to have more capacity within the same form factor due to more refined manufacturing.

Interestingly, even rechargeable AA-sized cells aren’t limited to NiMH chemistry any more, with Li-ion options now available yet still providing the 1.5 V one would expect. This does require a bit of electronics in the cell, and results in them having a capacity that’s similar to that of NiMH AA cells, while suffering all the aging issues of any other LIB in addition to the limited number of charge cycles. Assuming that the 1.2 V of NiMH cells is acceptable, then devices could accept AA or AAA NiMH cells.

Of note here is that none of this means that having a power input port for charging the battery or cell inside the device itself is no longer possible or allowed. Depending on the device manufacturer, the new EU regulations should mean little difference for the end user, other than having the option to pop open each device to extract and replace the battery. This could mean that wireless mice and Bluetooth headsets will soon feature an alternative to sticking in that charge cable and have the device be mostly useless until its built-in battery has soaked up sufficient juice.

Although this is an EU-only thing, it’s likely to come to every other part of the globe as well.",Hackaday,2025-10-23T14:00:45Z,https://hackaday.com/2025/10/23/built-in-batteries-a-daft-idea-with-an-uncertain-future/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:11.013597

Should Bitcoin bears start expecting a short squeeze soon?,"Key Takeaways

Is Bitcoin forming a potential market bottom?

Yes — Buy-Sell Pressure data signals a potential bottom, with BTC in a “bullish zone” while short traders face increasing risk.

What’s driving the current market divergence?

Institutions and spot investors briefly turned sellers, but rising Funding Rates and liquidation clusters suggest a possible short squeeze ahead.

Bitcoin [BTC] has yet to recover from the sharp decline it suffered on the 11th of October, which triggered a broader market downturn.

Trading at $107,510 at press time, the asset remained under selling pressure. However, new market indicators suggest that sellers may be betting on the wrong side.

Relief inflows and strengthening bullish signals could pave the way for a rally—potentially putting short traders at a loss.

Bitcoin bottom reach?

Buy-Sell Pressure data from Alphractal has begun signaling that a potential Bitcoin bottom may be forming.

The chart shows Bitcoin still in the green phase—its bullish zone—but approaching the red phase, where selling pressure typically intensifies.

Ordinarily, this would imply that Bitcoin could see a natural decline. However, analyst Joao Wedson noted a subtle distinction, saying.

“The 2025 cycle looks very different — it shows weaker, more subdued demand, nothing close to the euphoric spikes we witnessed in the past.”

He added that, unlike previous market cycles in 2017 and 2021, the current cycle appears more restrained—implying a potential euphoric phase could still lie ahead, which may drive the asset higher.

A more intriguing trend is visible in the Bitcoin/Gold chart, which shows Bitcoin continuing to rise against gold, posting an 8% gain in the past 24 hours.

This indicates that more capital is moving into Bitcoin compared to gold—which, notably, just recorded its steepest single-day decline in over a decade.

In an Email to AMBCrypto, Farzam Ehsani, Co-founder and CEO of VALR, explained that this shift from gold to Bitcoin is expected, stating:

“Investors taking risk off the table in one asset are likely to seek asymmetric upside in another, especially one still perceived as undervalued and under-owned relative to its potential.”

Institutions and spot investors diverge

Institutional and spot investors currently do not share the same bullish sentiment.

Institutional investors through U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs sold $101.3 million worth of BTC, while retail investors offloaded an even larger $165 million at the time of publication.

This appears to be a cooling phase, as both groups were net buyers the previous day. Institutional investors accumulated $477.19 million worth of Bitcoin with no outflows, while spot investors purchased $435.37 million.

Adding to the outlook, CryptoQuant data shows a recent surge in Bitcoin’s Funding Rate. At the time of writing, the total Funding Rate had turned positive, climbing to 0.0067% after previously dipping below zero.

The gradual alignment of retail, institutional, and derivatives activity places short traders at increasing risk.

Short squeeze on the horizon?

Enjoy a Japanese train seat heater at home this winter,"Bring the warmth of Japanese train seat heating into the comfort of your home.

It’s been a particularly odd year for weather in Japan, with the heat lingering until just a few days ago, when the temperatures fell dramatically to winter-like levels. As it feels like we’re skipping autumn and going straight into winter, we’re already looking for things to keep us warm, and this year there’s a new product to give us one of the most comforting features of a Japanese winter: train seat heating.

Created by Thanko, the quirky innovators who brought us a hot air bag clothes dryer and the chair umbrella, this clever product lets you enjoy the cosy warmth of a heated Japanese train seat, right in the comfort of your home or office.

Released on 22 September, the “Like a Train Seat Heater” provides calf-warming comfort in a choice of three colours — Red, Green, and “Glay” (“Grey”) — which are reminiscent of real train seat upholstery, to make it feel like you’re actually sitting on a train.

While Japanese trains tend to push air out from heaters underneath the seat, this product replicates that action with four heating zones: two under the thighs and two behind the calves, warming up those hard-to-reach areas.

The calf section includes a polycarbonate board with built-in springiness so the heating element feels comfortable against your lower legs.

It’s also designed with raised edges to recreate the snug fit of a train seat, which might just send you off into the same sort of blissful slumber you might enjoy on a long train ride.

Powered by USB, the temperature can be adjusted through three levels — High (46 degrees Celsius [115 degrees Fahrenheit]), Medium (44 degrees Celsius), and Low (42 degrees Celsius) — using a wired remote control. It automatically switches off after 60 minutes to prevent overheating and as a safeguard in case you forget to turn it off.

▼ With a storage pocket for a mobile battery included, the operating time is about four hours on High, five hours on Medium, and six hours on Low.

There are a lot of products on the market that’ll keep your body warm in winter but you’ll be hard-pressed to find one that warms your heart with the sensation of a cosy Japanese train ride as well. The “Like a Train Seat Heater” is priced at 6,980 yen (US$45.70), and can be purchased at Thanko’s official online store and physical retail locations.",SoraNews24,2025-10-23T14:00:14Z,https://soranews24.com/2025/10/23/enjoy-a-japanese-train-seat-heater-at-home-this-winter/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:17.941818
Mizuho downgrades Enphase on weak residential solar demand,"Investing.com -- Mizuho downgraded Enphase Energy to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target by 26% to $37, on expectations of weaker residential solar demand in 2026 and uncertainty around the company’s new lease-and-loan financing model.

The brokerage said it now expects U.S. residential solar installations to fall 20% next year to 3.8 gigawatts, with Enphase’s market share slipping as more homeowners adopt third-party ownership (TPO) models, such as leases offered by Sunrun and other installers.

Enphase’s approach, which does not rely on TPO, is seen as more complex for customers and less likely to drive near-term growth.

Mizuho expects Enphase’s U.S. microinverter sales to decline 8% year-on-year in 2026, with sell-through down 28%, partly cushioned by about $200 million in “safe harbor” orders expected in mid-2026 for projects due between 2029 and 2030.

The analysts see a near-term boost in the third quarter from those safe-harbor sales but warned that fourth-quarter guidance could miss consensus due to slower inventory movement ahead of a federal tax credit step-down.

Battery demand remains a bright spot, with attachment rates projected to rise to 20% and margins improving as new products launch, Mizuho said. But the firm said Enphase continues to lose share among new homebuilders and third-party installers.

“Our downgrade reflects reduced resi solar demand in 2026, lower solar market share due to lease switching, limited visibility into the success of a new lease+loan financing model for tail end of installers, and as cost declines from IQ9 tech adoption is limited to commercial market,” Mizuho analysts said.

Here are the 4 pillars of Trump’s growing crypto empire—and the key people running the show,"“In the Trump crypto ecosystem there are four different teams, all interrelated, but all kind of separate, that are all doing their own crypto stuff with Trump’s imprimatur,” explained Weiss.

The first of these businesses launched in December of 2022, well before Trump embraced crypto more broadly at a Bitcoin event on the campaign trail. It consisted of Trump NFTs and, following his election last November, has expanded to encompass Trump’s personal memecoin, which currently has a market cap of over $1 billion. All of these operations are overseen by Bill Zanker, a longtime confidant and business partner of the president.

The second Trump crypto business to emerge, and by far the most significant, is World Liberty Financial, which the family launched last fall. Its assets include the token WLFI, whose supply is currently worth around $3 billion, as well as a stablecoin called USD1. The latter token was used by a UAE firm to make a $2 billion investment in the crypto firm Binance. Meanwhile, World Liberty has also created a publicly traded entity whose share value is tied in large part to the WLFI token.

According to Weiss, the day-to-day operations of World Liberty Financial are handled by a pair of longtime crypto veterans named Zak Folkman and Chase Herro. The real power, though, appears to lie with Trump’s oldest sons, Don Jr. and Eric, who have been intimately involved in many of the company’s key decisions.

While Zanker’s NFT and memecoin operation as well as World Liberty Financial serve as vehicles to make money for the Trump family, the two entities have at times clashed. Weiss explained that one clash arose a few months back when Zanker announced plans to launch a crypto wallet only to be rebuffed by Trump’s sons, who have wallet plans of their own.

The third corporate vehicle for the president’s crypto ambitions is Trump Media & Technology Group, which once existed primarily to run the Truth Social platform, but has since expanded to operate a Bitcoin holding company akin to Michael Saylor’s Strategy. This business has also entered tie-ups with third-party firms like Singapore-based Crypto.com.

Finally, there is American Bitcoin, a crypto mining operation. This most recent venture came about after the Trump operation absorbed the mining operations of a firm called Hut 8. Overseen by Eric Trump, the operations now run under the new American Bitcoin name and benefit from the Trump family’s branding.

While all four of the Trump crypto entities are bringing in money for the family—billions by most estimates—their product lines and business purposes are often changing and evolving.

“The way I think about a lot of these Trump crypto ventures is, what was Trump’s business play before he became president? He took his name, lent it out, and got money for lending it out. Right? He put it on steaks, he put it on classes—he did a bunch of different things. That’s kind of what’s happening here,” said Weiss.",Fortune,2025-10-23T14:00:00Z,https://fortune.com/2025/10/23/here-are-the-4-pillars-of-trumps-growing-crypto-empire-and-the-key-people-running-the-show/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:24.387955

"Kingsley Ben-Adir and Archie Madekwe to Play Brothers in Bijan Sheibani’s ‘The Arrival’ for ‘Conclave’ Producers, Michael Fassbender’s DMC Film","Rising British stars Kingsley Ben-Adir (“Bob Marley: One Love,” “Barbie”) and Archie Madekwe (“Lurker,” “Saltburn”) are teaming up to lead the cast of “The Arrival” alongside Joanna Scanlan (“After Love,” “Joy”) and Alex Descas (“Let the Sunshine In,” “Raising Colours”).

The film marks the feature directorial debut of award-winning theater director Bijan Sheibani, based on his acclaimed play of the same name, and boasts an array of prestige producers behind the camera in Michael Fassbender‘s DMC Film and House Productions, which made “Conclave.” Cornerstone is handling worldwide sales and will be launching the project at the American Film Market.

Described as a “gut-wrenching, depiction of identity, obsession and betrayal,” “The Arrival” — which has now wrapped in London after shooting under the radar across the U.K. — charts the reunion of two long-lost brothers, Raheem (Madekwe) and Tom (Ben-Adir) in adulthood. Tom, the elder of the two, was given up for adoption as an infant. The film examines the “exhilarating and uncanny experience” of meeting a blood brother for the first time in adulthood. As the two grow closer, seduced by the idea of their shared history finally making sense, they must confront the uncomfortable truths at the heart of their family, and the impossible decision that their parents (Scanlan and Descas) made thirty years ago.

Sheibani is an Olivier Award-winning director and “The Arrival” marked his writing debut for the theatre. Most recently, he directed “Till the Stars Come Down” for the National Theatre, which successfully transferred to the Theatre Royal Haymarket. For TV, he wrote multiple episodes of “One Day” for Netflix. Other acclaimed theatre directing credits include “Dance Nation” (Almeida Theatre), “Barber Shop Chronicles” (National Theatre) and “The Brothers Size” (Young Vic).

“The Arrival” was developed by Sheibani with Film4 alongside DMC Film (“Kneecap,” “Calm With Horses”) and House Productions (“Conclave,” “The Iron Claw”) who also have co-produced the film. It is co-financed by Film4 and the BFI (awarding National Lottery funding).

The film is produced by BAFTA Award winner and Emmy Award nominee Tessa Ross (“Conclave,” “Slumdog Millionaire”) Emmy Award nominee Juliette Howell (“Brexit: The Uncivil War,” “Conclave”) and BIFA winner Theo Barrowclough (“Scrapper,” “Mint”) for House Productions. Oscar and BAFTA nominee Fassbender, BIFA and BAFTA nominee Daniel Emmerson and Conor McCaughan produce for DMC Film. Nell Green also produces the feature. David Kimbangi is executive producer for Film4 and Ama Ampadu for the BFI. It has been shooting in the U.K. across the summer.

“Having worked with Bijan on his Film4-backed short Morning Song and throughout development of the script, we’re so proud to see The Arrival come to life,” said David Kimbangi, senior commissioning executive at Film4. “The calibre of the cast and crew that have attached to the film is testament to Bijan’s undeniable writing, his reputation in theatre, and it has been a joy collaborating with him, Theo Barrowclough, and our partners at the BFI.”

Added Ampadu, senior production and development executive at the BFI: “In ‘The Arrival,’ Bijan Sheibani is bringing his unique voice and style to create a film that deftly explores issues of identity and roads not taken. Following his success in theatre and based on his play of the same name, Bijan and his producer Theo Barrowclough have brought together a fantastic team and an exciting cast, led by Archie Madekwe and Kingsley Ben-Adir, to create a gripping, striking and heartfelt debut feature.”",Variety,2025-10-23T14:00:00Z,https://variety.com/2025/film/global/kingsley-ben-adir-archie-madekwe-the-arrival-1236559555/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:26.431861
Does market access drive trade growth? Evidence from China,"3.2.1. Explained variable.

The high-quality development of foreign trade is a comprehensive concept that any single indicator, such as trade volume, trade structure, or trade efficiency, cannot adequately represent. Academic research has no unified standard for the comprehensive measurement and evaluation of foreign trade quality. Based on the requirements of China’s “14th Five-Year Plan for High-Quality Development of Foreign Trade” and existing research on high-quality trade development indicators [2], this study develops a comprehensive evaluation system consisting of four dimensions: trade development environment, trade development conditions, trade development capacity, and trade cooperation, along with 10 sub-indicators. The system provides a detailed and systematic assessment of the high-quality development of foreign trade in 260 cities in China. (Table 1). The entropy weight method is employed to calculate the high-quality development index of urban foreign trade, thereby reducing the influence of subjective judgment. Due to significant regional differences in trade development among Chinese cities, the trade quality index will show a significant right-skewed distribution. However, this indicates that the level of high-quality trade development reflected by the index is both expected and reasonable. A few cities exhibit outstanding innovation, openness, and cooperation performance, while most remain in early development stages. To alleviate this skewness in regression analysis, we apply a logarithmic transformation to the index, ensuring consistency with the log specification of the market access variable and improving model robustness.

The high-quality trade development index (Trade) distribution is right-skewed (Fig 1). This skewness primarily arises from the significant heterogeneity in trade development levels across the 260 cities in China, with a small number of highly developed cities (such as Shenzhen and Shanghai) disproportionately raising the upper tail of the distribution. The fundamental cause of this skewed characteristic lies in the reality of urban development in China. Among the 260 cities, most are medium-sized or small, with only a few megacities (such as Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) highly developed in foreign trade and innovation. This leads to scores being highly concentrated in the middle or lower value range, with only a few cities achieving very high scores, raising the maximum value and causing the distribution to skew to the right. However, this is consistent with Chinese cities’ current foreign trade development.

(2) Explanatory Variable

Following the methodology of Donaldson and Hornbeck (2017), the Market Access index for each city-year combination is calculated using the following formula:

(1)

Where Nc’t represents the economic scale (proxied by GDP) of city c’ in year t, this study follows Donaldson and Hornbeck by using the population as an alternative proxy for economic scale in supplemental calculations to test robustness. The parameter θ represents trade elasticity, which is set to 8.22 by established studies [39,40]. The variable τcc’t represents the iceberg cost—the implicit cost of transporting goods from city c to city c’ in year t.

The iceberg cost is computed as follows:

(2)

where denotes the shortest transportation time between cities c and c′ in year t, and ρ is a given parameter set at 0.008 following the approach of Baum-Snow et al. [14]. This calculation method leverages detailed road network data to estimate the shortest transportation paths between cities, even without actual firm-level transportation cost records. The functional form also effectively captures the dynamic influence of national road network upgrades on economic indicators. Using an exponent of 0.8 for the minimum transport time ensures the iceberg cost behaves as a concave function, reflecting the positive association between iceberg costs and transportation time and accurately depicting the feature of diminishing marginal transport costs as total travel time increases.

(3) Moderating Variable

The level of industrial rationalization is measured using a Theil index-based method [41], which has been widely recognized for its ability to capture the efficiency of resource allocation across industries [42–44]. The industrial rationalization index (TL) is calculated as follows:

(3)

Where TL represents the industrial rationalization index for city c in year t is the output of industry i in city c at time t denotes the total industrial output of city c and represent the employment in industry i and the total employment across all industries in city c at time t, respectively. The closer TL is to zero, the higher the level of industrial rationalization, indicating an increasingly balanced and efficient allocation of resources among industries.

(4) Mechanism Variables

For the measurement of industrial advancement (Adv), this study adopts the improved structural similarity coefficient method, also known as the cosine angle method [45]. This convenient method produces intuitive results and supports inter-regional and time-series comparative analysis. The calculation formula is as follows:

(4)

Where is defined as the three-dimensional vector of the GDP share of value added of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in a region; =(1,0,0), = (0,1,0), =(0,0,1) represent the theoretical state of the three industries in the state of complete specialization; represents the angle between the actual industrial structure vector and the respective benchmark vectors ; is the index of industrial advancement, and the increase of its value directly reflects the evolution of industrial structure to higher-order form.

In this study, economic agglomeration (EA) is measured by GDP per unit of land area. The economic output per unit of area better reflects the degree of agglomeration of local economic activity. Moreover, considering both market size and regional size helps to mitigate measurement bias arising from geographical differences [46]. The formula is as follows:

(5)

In this equation, denotes the level of economic activity in city during year ; represents the gross domestic product of city in year ; is the total land area of city , which remains constant over time. This specification captures the intensity of economic activity per unit of land, thereby reflecting the spatial agglomeration of economic output while controlling for regional size differences.

(5) Control Variables

Following established literature, several control variables are introduced to mitigate the influence of confounding factors on foreign trade quality development:

Economic Development Level (lnGNI): measured as the logarithm of regional gross national income. Urbanization Level (Urb): represented by the logarithm of the city’s total year-end population. Government Intervention (Gov): measured as the ratio of general government expenditure to regional GDP. Financial Development (Fin): measured as the ratio of the year-end balance of financial institution loans and deposits to regional GDP. Living Standard (Live): measured as the number of hospital beds per 100 residents.",Plos.org,2025-10-23T14:00:00Z,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334661,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:32.727660
Lychee13-3634: A new lychee image dataset and classification methodological evaluation,"Introduction

As one of the most popular fruits in tropical and subtropical regions, Lychee is not only loved by consumers for its sweet taste, but also attracts attention for its rich nutritional value. Precise lychee classification can accurately identify the appearance, color, and shape, effectively avoiding the subjectivity and errors associated with traditional methods, while high speed and efficiency enable faster quality inspection in production. Therefore, high accuracy and efficiency play an indispensable role in production. Recently, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning and deep learning [1,2] have been widely applied in image classification and identification tasks to improve the accuracy and efficiency [3–5]. For the task of lychee image classification, advanced technology can be used to achieve more accurate and faster classification, laying the foundation for the intelligent development of the lychee industry [6]. However, despite significant progress in image recognition technology [7–11] for classifying other agricultural products, research on lychee image classification still faces many challenges. Compared to other fruits, lychee has many varieties and subtle differences in appearance characteristics between different varieties, such as color, texture, shape, and so on. Traditional classification methods often rely on human experience, which is not only inefficient but also susceptible to subjective factors. Therefore, building a dataset that comprehensively covers different lychee varieties and appearance characteristics is crucial to promoting the development of lychee image classification technology.

The existing dataset containing lychee images usually only treats lychee as a rough category among many fruit classifications, which is difficult to meet the multi-variety lychee classification tasks in the market. In other words, currently, lychee datasets have the problems of limited data and incomplete variety coverage [12,13], which limits the generalization ability of machine learning and deep learning models in lychee variety recognition [14]. Besides, data imbalance also affects the recognition accuracy of the model for a few categories of lychee varieties [15]. To make up for these problems, this study innovatively proposes a comprehensive lychee dataset (Lychee13-3634) containing 13 typical varieties and 3634 images. Compared to other datasets, Lychee13-3634 is a more comprehensive and unified lychee dataset. For example, Fruits-360 has not explicitly disclosed their image resolution, while Lychee13-3634 uniformly uses a high-definition resolution of 400 × 400 pixels. This is more in line with the input requirements and helps improve the training performance of classification models. Moreover, in terms of sample balance, there is a significant difference in the number of samples for different fruit categories in Fruits-360, while the Lychee13-3634 has achieved a class imbalance rate (IR) of only 1.6 through careful construction, demonstrating a relatively more balanced class distribution. This is crucial for training a comprehensive and accurate lychee classification or recognition model. To sum up, through the detailed data acquisition and screening process, we ensured the accuracy and diversity of the Lychee13-3634, and provided a new benchmark and test platform for lychee image classification research.

In addition, to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the Lychee13-3634, we used 21 state-of-the-art classification models, including 6 typical ResNet-series, 10 deep learning-series, and 5 YOLO-series models for lychee image classification training. During the training, we used a series of performance indicators to comprehensively evaluate the classification performance and efficiency of each model. The results of these indicators directly reflect the performance of each model in lychee image classification. Through in-depth analysis and interpretation of these indicators, we not only understand the advantages and disadvantages of each model in the classification task, but also deeply explore the reasons for the performance differences between different models. This detailed analysis not only helps us better understand the characteristics of each model, but also provides a useful reference for future research, which helps to further promote the development of lychee image classification technology.

Related exisiting fruit datasets

In this section, we conducted research and summarized existing commonly used fruit image datasets (including/excluding lychee images). Table 1 provides detailed information about each dataset, including publication year, classes, class number, total image number, image size, format, method type (classification, segmentation, or recognition), and including/excluding lychee images.

Fruits-360 dataset [12] is a public baseline dataset for classification tasks. It contains 94,110 images of 141 different fruit, vegetable, and nut classes, with 70,491 for training and 23,619 for testing, respectively. All images were taken from different angles and lighting conditions, providing a rich visual diversity. The Fruits-360 has a pure white image background, and each image contains only one complete fruit, and only 490 lychee images without further precise category labels. This data collection method guarantees the representation of color, texture, and shape, which is well suited for training and evaluating fruit classification models. Its size and diversity support the effective performance of deep learning models in fruit recognition tasks, commonly used for benchmarking and research development.

Fruits-262 dataset [13] is an image dataset containing 262 different categories of fruits. It is designed for computer vision tasks such as image classification and object recognition. The dataset consists of natural background images, each containing multiple fruits, with an average number of images of 861, a median of 1007, and a standard deviation of 276. Building the dataset involved crawling images from the Internet, automatic and manual filtering, and image resizing. This dataset can be used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize and classify different fruits. It can also serve as a valuable resource for studying computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

FruitNet: Indian-Fruits-Dataset-With-Quality dataset [16] address the need for high-quality fruit images. It contains 14,700 high-resolution images of 6 popular Indian fruits. The dataset is divided into 3 subfolders based on fruit quality: 1) good quality, 2) poor quality, and 3) uneven quality. Each subfolder contains images of 6 fruits: apple, banana, guava, lime, orange, and pomegranate. All images are taken with a high-end resolution camera under various backgrounds and lighting conditions and are valuable for training, testing, and validating fruit classification or reconstruction models.

Fruits-Images dataset [17] is widely used in computer vision and deep learning research, including 360 high-quality images of a category of common fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, kiwifruit, and strawberries, with a single image containing multiple fruits of the same variety. Despite the relatively small number of images, different shooting conditions and angles provide valuable training data for developing and evaluating classification models. Fruits-Images has accurate class labels, supports supervised learning tasks, and contributes to the progress of image classification techniques and the improvement of fruit recognition techniques.

Fruit-Classifiation dataset [18] is designed for image classification and contains 22,495 images from 33 categories such as watermelon, dragon fruit, and corn. Most of the images are with a size of 100 × 100, and there are references to Fruits-360 images that often include rotations to aid training and improve usability. The main application of this dataset is to improve the accuracy of fruit image recognition. In practice, it is common to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization and augmentation to optimize model performance.

Comprehensive-Fruit-Image dataset [19] is a valuable resource that provides support for image classification and recognition models. It contains 20 different fruit categories and uses specific fruit names as search criteria to carefully pick and download images from the DuckDuckGo search engine to ensure a diverse and high-quality dataset. In particular, each fruit category contains a large number of pulp images for efficient model training and testing. The images in the dataset are stored in high-resolution format and organized by fruit type for use during model training and evaluation. This dataset can be used for a variety of machine learning tasks, such as image classification and recognition, as well as enhancement of computer vision models. It is also a practical resource for students and educators in the field of machine learning and computer vision. By providing a diverse and curated collection of fruit images, this dataset aims to facilitate significant progress in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Researchers and developers can use this dataset to build robust, accurate, and efficient image recognition systems.

To sum up, the existing fruit and vegetable datasets contain few specific lychee varieties, or the variety is not detailed enough. It just exists as a fruit and vegetable category. For example, the Fruits-360 dataset, which is widely used for fruit classification, contains a large number of fruit images with distinct visual features, while lychee varieties exhibit high similarity and low inter-class differences. In contrast, lychee varieties often exhibit subtle differences in color, texture, and shape, posing unique challenges for lychee classification. This highlights the need for a specialized dataset for lychee classification. Besides, with the advancement of agricultural intelligence, fast and accurate classification of lychee varieties is of great significance for optimizing market supply, reducing labor consumption, and improving production efficiency. Effective recognition of different varieties of lychee images can meet the practical needs of agricultural production, quality control, market classification, and consumer choice. Therefore, a more refined lychee dataset needs to be proposed.

The proposed dataset: Lychee13-3634

In this section, we first introduce lychee image acquisition and then introduce the lychee image background preprocessing. Finally, we present the overview of Lychees13-3634 and analyze the balance of it. The overall flowchart of this work is shown as Fig 1.

It illustrates the complete process of this work, which mainly includes four stages, i.e., lychee image acquisition, preprocessing, training-test set segmentation, and classification model training.

Lychee image acquisition

To solve the problem of lychee non-fine-grained classification, we construct a new lychee image dataset (Lychee13-3634), which aims to provide high-quality training and testing data for the deep learning model of lychee image classification or recognition. Notably, the construction of Lychee13-3634 is mainly based on the three aspects of market prevalence, sales volume, and availability. Specifically, we selected 13 varieties widely distributed in southern China to ensure the universality and sufficient data samples for collection. Moreover, their extensive market liquidity makes sample collection convenient. Meanwhile, the existing relative researches provide reference for data annotation, analysis, and model training, which greatly improves data availability and helps to build a high-quality lychee dataset.

All the lychee images are freshly picked and taken with a high-resolution camera under indoor lighting conditions. Specifically, the capture camera is a 48-million pixel main camera with a 24 mm focal length and f/1.78 aperture. The advanced camera configurations ensure the high quality of image acquisition and provide a solid foundation for the reliability of experimental results. During shooting, special attention was paid to factors such as illumination uniformity and background conciseness to ensure clear image quality, true color, and to reflect the real appearance characteristics of lychee.

The proposed Lychee13-3634 dataset was collected by the authors themselves. All lychee image data were purchased from publicly available markets in strict compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines. The purpose of the Lychee13-3634 collection is limited to scientific research, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lychee image classification and recognition.

Lychee image preprocessing

To facilitate the training of the deep learning model, we pre-process the lychee images. Including background preprocessing, uniformizing the image size to a resolution suitable for model input (400×400 pixels). In addition, we also randomly divided the Lychee13-3634 into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) to meet the needs of different research stages. In particular, for the specific background pre-process, we provide its pseudocode implementation in Algorithm 1.

Noted: This background preprocessing approach assumes uniform backgrounds and that alternative methods may be needed for complex field conditions, such as varying lighting or occlusions.

As shown in Fig 2, it provides a comparison of lychee samples before and after background preprocessing. Obviously, after background preprocessing, the noise issues such as shadows caused by unstable lighting during image capture have been balanced. This can make the dataset more standardized and unified, thereby reducing bias caused by the dataset during model training.

It can be seen that before processing, there are interferences such as referencing, uneven lighting, and blurring in the image background. While after processing, it illustrates clearly and uniformly, making it easy for fine-tuning in other research.

Lychee13-3634 overview

Lychee13-3634 is a comprehensive and standardized lychee image dataset, which contains 3634 images, covering 13 representative varieties. These varieties have high popularity and economic value in the market, covering the main types and variations of lychee. Table 2 and Fig 3 provide a detailed summary of Lychee13-3634. And Fig 4 shows 13 different varieties of single and multiple lychee samples, respectively.

Each category includes different numbers of images with a single lychee and images containing multiple lychees of the same variety, and the average number of single lychee images is around 220, while the average number of multiple lychee images is around 60.

It can be seen that the differences between most categories are small and difficult to distinguish directly.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334900.g004

To the best of our knowledge, the proposed Lychee13-3634 dataset is the first benchmark dataset for fine-grained classification of lychee to date. However, there are still certain limitations. On one hand, it does not include information on the maturity of the lychees, which may affect the model’s generalizability. On the other hand, the sizes and the production area of different lychee varieties were not recorded during data collection. This lack of information may limit the dataset’s applicability in certain research scenarios. Additionally, while efforts were made to ensure data quality, potential biases may still exist due to factors such as uneven sample distribution or variations in shooting conditions.

Lychee13-3634 balance analysis

For further analysis, we use the imbalance rate (IR) [20], which is an important indicator to measure the imbalance degree of the dataset. IR is defined as the ratio of the number of samples in the majority class to that in the minority class. A higher IR value typically leads to poorer classification performance, especially for minority classes, and it is expressed as,

(1)

where and denote the maximum and the minimum sample size in a set, respectively. The closer the IR value is to 1, the more balanced the dataset becomes. The specific IR ratios of Lychee13-3634 are shown in Table 3. It can be found that the IR value of ’single’ category (image only contains a single lychee) and ’multiple’ category (image contains multiple lychees of the same variety) is 3.6 (the maximum category is ’single’, the minimum category is ’multiple’). The IR of the entire dataset (both ’single’ and ’multiple’ categories) is 1.6 (the maximum category is ’HangingGreen lychee’, the minimum category is ’Guiwei lychee’). The IR of only the ’single’ category is 1.7 (the maximum category is ’HangingGreen lychee’, the minimum category is ’Guiwei lychee’), and the IR of only the ’multiple’ category is 1.9 (the maximum category is ’TopScorerRed lychee’ and the minimum category is ’Whitewax lychee’). In summary, Lychee13-3634 is a relatively balanced dataset compared to other fruit datasets. Data balance is crucial for ensuring that models perform well across all categories, especially for datasets with fewer categories.

Experimental results on Lychee13-3634

To create a high-quality and highly representative dataset system for experimental validation, we adopt stratified random sampling to divide Lychee13-3634 into a fixed 80% (2907 images for training) and 20% (727 images for testing) to maintain the variety distribution similar to the original dataset.

Image classification models

To validate the applicability and effectiveness of Lychee13-3634, we selected 16 representative or recent deep learning-based classification models [21–23], including ResNet152, ResNet101, ResNet50, ResNet34, ResNet18 [24], EfficientNetv2-s, EfficientNetv2-m, EfficientNetv2-l [25], SENet [26], Vision Transformer [27], Res-Att-Net [28], MobileViT [29], SqueezeNet [30], ShuffleNetv2 [31], MobileNetV2 [32], and MobileNetV4 [33], as well as 5 YOLO (-v5 [34], -v7 [35], -v8 [36], -v9 [37], and -v10 [38]) algorithms for experiments. These classifiers were chosen for their superior performance, lower computational complexity, and good generalization ability, particularly in classification tasks. Specifically, ResNet series solves the problem of gradient disappearance in traditional neural networks through residual connections and can conduct deeper training on lychee images and achieve better feature extraction. Moreover, different depth versions of ResNet can be flexibly adapted to the size of the dataset and computing resources, an advantage over many other architectures. Deep learning-based models have the unique advantages of attention mechanisms and lightweight design, meeting the different analysis requirements of the lychee dataset. YOLO series has excellent real-time object detection performance and can provide fast and accurate lychee classification results, which is difficult for most other architectures to achieve. All the compared methods were coded with the PyTorch framework. To ensure optimal performance of each model, we retained their original hyper-parameter settings, as detailed in Table 4. Notably, in the last column, the data marked as ’Fixed (8:2)’ means that the method uses a fixed split of 8:2 for training/testing sets.

Experimental evaluation indicators

Classification effectiveness evaluation indicators. In this paper, we use common evaluation indicators [39,40], including Precision (Pre.), Recall [41] (Rec.), F1-Score [42] (F1.), Accuracy [43] (Acc.), top-1 and top-5 [44], to comprehensively evaluate and analyze the classification performance of different models on both the Fruits-360 and our Lychee13-3634. In particular, top-1 accuracy is the proportion of samples for which the model’s highest predicted probability class matches the actual class, while top-5 accuracy is that for which the actual class is among the top five predicted probability classes. The two indicators are particularly suitable for multi-classification tasks. They reflect the model’s performance in single predictions and candidate predictions, respectively. All the above evaluation indicators can respectively be defined as,

(2)(3)(4)(5)

Model performance evaluation indicators. The number of model parameters (Params) and the model running time (Times) are used for the model performance evaluation, where Params refers to the total number of trainable parameters contained in the model. It directly affects the model’s complexity and computational cost. In the lychee classification task, choosing a model with a moderate parameter count can reduce computational resource consumption while ensuring performance. And Times refers to the duration required for the model to make a prediction, including forward propagation and any necessary post-processing steps. In real-time application scenarios, time is a critical performance metric. Shorter prediction times mean the model can respond to queries more quickly, enhancing user experience.

Lychee13-3634 evaluation

In this section, we apply 16 typical state-of-the-art deep learning-based models and 5 YOLO-series models for multi-class analysis on both our Lychee13-3634 and the existing Fruits-360.

Classification results on Lychee13-3634.

To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the constructed Lychee13-3634, we introduced a variety of existing ResNet-based, deep learning-based, and YOLO-series models to carry out lychee image classification experiments. It is noted that for the YOLO series models, we first annotate the Lychee13-3634 and then use five common YOLO series models to carry out the lychee classification. The input image size is set to 256 × 256. The classification results are shown in Table 5, it can be found that SqueezeNet shows the worst performance with an accuracy of 71.53%. This may be due to its simple architecture, limited model capacity, and lack of targeted optimization for multi-classification tasks, resulting in unsatisfactory classification results for Lychee13-3634. In contrast, EfficientNetv2-s shows excellent performance with an accuracy of 99.99%. Although EfficientNetv2-m has the same performance as EfficientNetv2-s, it has significant expansion in parameter number (from 21.46M to 54.14M), which directly leads to the rise of its calculation cost and the extension of the average prediction time. For the YOLO series, it can be seen that all the YOLO algorithms achieve good classification performance on Lychee13-3634. In particular, YOLOv7 and YOLOv10 stand out in both precision and mAP50, with both values of 98%, showing a strong classification ability.

To sum up, from the comprehensive consideration of classification accuracy and model efficiency, it can be considered that the EfficientNetv2-s model has more prominent advantages in the task of lychee image classification. To observe the excellent classification performance of EfficientNetv2-s more intuitively, we provide its confusion matrix as shown in Fig 5. It can be observed that the best model has the highest probability of misclassifying Guiwei as Heiye (8%), followed by misclassifying Chickenmouth as Xianjinfeng (2%). Fig 6 gives the visual examples of the common misclassified lychee varieties. It can be speculated that such misclassification is caused by the similarity of lychees themselves (Guiwei and Blackleaf), as well as uncontrollable factors such as light control, shooting distance, and freshness during the dataset acquisition process. This is also an important direction for the further improvement of the dataset in the future.

It can be found that except for the misclassification probability of 0.08 for ’ChickenMouth_1ychee’ as ’Xianjinfeng_lychee’ and 0.02 for ’Guiwei_1ychee’ as ’Blackleaf_lychee’, all other diagonal values are 1.0, which proves the strong strength and reliability of EfficientNetv2-s in lychee classification tasks.

(a) shows the easily confused Guiwei and Blackleaf varieties, which have similar textures and sizes. (b) shows the easily confused ChickenMouth and Xianjinfeng varieties, which have similar peel colors. This shows that the misclassification of lychees may not only be caused by the natural texture itself, but also by external factors such as freshness, angle, distance, and lighting when shooting.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334900.g006

In addition, to verify whether the performance differences between different models are significant, we use K-fold cross validation (K=5 in this paper) for statistical testing, that is, through multiple iterations, each image can participate in both training and testing to avoid the random deviation of a single division. It is noted that, considering the uniformity of various indicators for different models and the fact that other indicators can be indirectly calculated through Acc. and Pre., we only use Acc. and Pre. as the result indicators of the statistical test of model differences. As shown in Table 6, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on the K-fold experimental results shows that the performance differences between the models are extremely statistically significant ( ), that is, the average accuracy of high-performance models such as EfficientNetv2-l and SENet exceeds 99%, which is 2.46% higher than the average accuracy of medium-performance models such as ResNet-152 (96.56%), and the difference is significant, while the accuracy of lightweight models (such as SqueezeNet) is less than 75%, which is more than 15% lower than other models. Among the same type of models, there is no significant difference in performance between YOLOv5 and YOLOv9, but the former is more stable. VisionTransformer has a slight advantage over traditional CNN-based methods but is inferior to high-performance CNN-based methods. This indicates that there is a real gap in the model architecture’s ability to extract features from lychee images. In practical applications, models with significant advantages can be selected based on accuracy requirements and resource constraints.

Recognition results on Lychee13-3634.

YOLO-series models are renowned for their superior object recognition capabilities. To further validate the wide availability of Lychee13-3634, we perform the lychee image recognition task by training the five different YOLO models on it. The recognition results are shown in Table 7. It can be found that YOLOv10 gets the best comprehensive recognition results. To some extent, the data from Table 7 also reflects the applicability of Lychee13-3634 in image recognition.

Classification results on Fruits-360.

To verify the effectiveness of our Lychee13-3634 and explore the generalization ability of each model on different datasets, we used another dataset (Fruits-360 [12]), which is widely recognized in the field of fruit classification, to carry out an extended experiment. The Fruits-360 has a wide range of fruit types and rich images, which can provide a variety of test scenarios for the classification model.

The classification results on Fruits-360 are shown in Table 8, it is worth noting that EfficientNetv2-s once again shows excellent performance, and its accuracy is as high as 99.9%. It can be seen that in the field of classification of a variety of fruits or lychee, EfficientNetv2 shows the best effect and has the highest applicability. However, the performance of ResNet34 is relatively inferior, and its accuracy rate is 91.2%. Despite SqueezeNet performing poorly in the lychee classification, it shows adaptability to a variety of fruit classifications, which may be related to the differences in dataset characteristics. In summary, the classification results of each model on Lychee13-3634 are consistent with those on Fruits-360, which reflect the similarities and differences between the two datasets. This consistency strongly proves the effectiveness of the lychee dataset proposed in this paper in capturing lychee characteristics, and its generalization is equivalent to other widely recognized fruit datasets (such as Fruits-360). Notably, due to the huge amount of data in the Fruits-360 and the lack of label files directly applicable to the YOLO-series model, we did not use the YOLO-series model for testing in this study.

Based on experimental results on Lychee13-3634 and Fruits-360, it can be observed the significant differences in performance between different models. Specifically, in terms of classification performance, Resnet-152 successfully alleviated the gradient disappearance problem due to its sufficient depth and effective residual structure. Res-Att-Net is more consistent with the data characteristics. This demonstrates that the feature distribution and complexity of the dataset have a direct impact on the model performance. EfficientNetv2 series performs well in both datasets, demonstrating the wide adaptability of its architecture to different datasets. VisionTransformer has a low recall on Fruits-360, probably because of its weak ability to capture local detailed features. In terms of parameter optimization, the general strategy is dynamically adjusting the learning rate, such as using a large learning rate at the initial stage of training to converge quickly, while reducing the learning rate at the later stage to avoid missing the optimal solution. The weight initialization can be selected according to model structure. For instance, residual network adjusts jump connections or adds batch normalization, and EfficientNetv2 series optimizes data enhancement strategy to further improve model performance.

Model efficiency evaluation

In addition, we also comprehensively compare the parameter number and running time of each model on both Lychee13-3634 and Fruits-360, as shown in Table 9. On Lychee13-3634, the Res-Att-Net had the shortest average classification time (0.0011s), followed by MobileNet (0.0014s). Although EfficientNetv2-l has excellent classification performance, the average time of it is the longest (1.0764s). On Fruits-360, SqueezeNet has the shortest average time (0.0001s). Similarly, the EfficientNet series still takes the longest time (0.9758s). In terms of the parameter number, SqueezeNet is the least (0.73M). The EfficentNetv2-l model has the most parameters (118.52M). In summary, EfficientNetv2 has the best classification performance, but it also has the longest running time and the most parameters.

Ablation studies

In this section, we conducted ablation studies on different background preprocessing and dataset balance of Lychee13-3634.

Impact of dataset preprocessing on model.

To evaluate the impact of different background preprocessing techniques on the classification performance, we compared the accuracy of three different models (SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and YOLOv8) without background preprocessing, black background preprocessing, and white background preprocessing, respectively. The three selected models cover classifiers of different performance levels, and thus it can more comprehensively analyze the impact of background processing and model architecture on classification performance.

As shown in Table 10, it can be found that background processing has a significant impact on model performance. Specifically, white background preprocessing can improve the classification accuracy, while black background preprocessing leads to performance degradation. Moreover, the adaptability of different models to background changes varies. EfficientNet shows the most stable performance under different background treatments. SqueezeNet is sensitive to background changes. YOLOv8 performs well in unprocessed backgrounds, but has limited adaptability in black backgrounds.

Impact of dataset IR on model.

To evaluate the impact of dataset balance on model classification performance, we aligned the number of samples in all categories of Lychee13-3634 with the category with the smallest number of samples in Lychee13-3634, and constructed a balanced dataset. We respectively chose one algorithm from the ResNet series (ResNet50), deep learning series (MobileViT), and YOLO series (YOLOv8) as an example to conduct an ablation study.

As shown in Table 11, after dataset balancing, the accuracy, precision, and F1-score of the three models have been improved to varying degrees. This indicates that the balance of the dataset is crucial for improving the generalization and classification performance of the model. Future research will further explore how to optimize the balance of the dataset through data augmentation and sampling techniques, thereby improving the robustness and classification accuracy of the model.",Plos.org,2025-10-23T14:00:00Z,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334900,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:35.110381
Keyrock: Crypto’s Buyback Boom Tests the Industry’s Financial Maturity,"As token buybacks gain popularity in crypto, Amir Hajian, head of research at market making firm Keyrock, warns in a new report that every dollar spent repurchasing tokens is a dollar diverted from growth and innovation, underscoring the hidden opportunity cost behind the show of confidence.

Token buybacks involve blockchain projects repurchasing their own tokens from the open market, similar to stock buybacks. The strategy sucks out circulating supply from the market, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the token's value to signal confidence to investors.

The rise of token buybacks marks a turning point in how crypto defines maturity, Hajian argues in the report shared with CoinDesk, writing that what began as an effort to prove that protocols could return value like companies has become a stress test of their financial realism. The key point is whether protocols can repurchase with the restraint of a central bank rather than the twitchy reflexes of a bull market.

Much of this capital for buybacks comes from treasuries rather than recurring revenue, exposing how quickly the pursuit of legitimacy can drain future runway.

With clearer rules forming in the U.S. for crypto and protocols finally generating consistent fee income, token buybacks have emerged as the preferred way to link revenue to holder value.

Hajian finds that protocol payouts to token holders have risen more than 400% since 2024, hitting nearly $800 million in the third quarter of 2025.

Across 12 revenue-distributing protocols studied, teams returned an average of 64% of total revenue to holders, far higher than traditional DAOs, which reinvest roughly three-quarters of spending into growth and development.

That tilt toward distributions over reinvestment, Hajian writes, has forced protocols to confront the limits of one-time treasury spending. As markets mature and revenues normalize, projects can no longer afford buybacks that treat capital as infinite or timing as irrelevant.

In response, some teams are rethinking how and when value should return to holders, tying repurchases to valuation metrics, cash flow strength, and market conditions rather than fixed percentages.

Hajian points to the rise of trigger-based and options-based models as early signs of this shift, designed to make buybacks counter-cyclical, revenue-sensitive, and sustainable beyond the next bull cycle.

Trigger-based systems tie spending to measurable fundamentals, such as valuation multiples or fully diluted value bands, increasing allocations when tokens look undervalued and scaling them back when prices run hot.

Options-based structures go a step further, allowing protocols to sell covered puts and earn premium income while committing to future buy levels, a design that generates revenue even when no buyback occurs.

Hajian argues that these models together reflect a maturing approach to tokenomics, writing that they are healthy for treasury management as they align buybacks with real market conditions.

The report also warns that execution quality remains an under appreciated risk.

Most projects use taker orders that pull liquidity from thin order books, exaggerating price swings once buying stops. Calibrating buybacks to organic volume and leaning on maker orders, Hajian writes, would allow protocols to add liquidity instead of consuming it.

So, When Should Token Buybacks Occur?

A protocol should only initiate buybacks once its revenues are recurring, its treasury can cover at least two years of operations, and its valuation multiples suggest that the token is trading below fundamentals, Hajian argues.

Mature projects tend to launch buybacks when financial strength is evident: Revenues are stable, market liquidity is deep, and the protocol’s valuation has reached levels where capital returns make economic sense rather than promotional sense.

In contrast, newer teams often deploy buybacks too early to attract users or attention, mistaking visibility for value. These premature buybacks drain the reserves needed to fund product, growth, and R&D, Hajian writes.

It might just be that the real test is not the presence of a buyback policy but the discipline to wait until the fundamentals justify one. Buybacks aren’t proof of success, but rather they’re a measure of whether crypto can evolve from distributing promise to managing profit.",CoinDesk,2025-10-23T14:00:00Z,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/23/keyrock-crypto-s-buyback-boom-tests-the-industry-s-financial-maturity,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:38.991205
Our first carbon capture and storage project,"At Google, we’re advancing a broad portfolio of new energy technologies that can support our growth and enable a reliable, affordable, clean energy future.

When we published our strategy to advance the next generation of clean electricity sources, we identified a suite of technologies we would work to commercialize — setting the scene for pioneering agreements to procure enhanced geothermal, advanced nuclear and long duration energy storage. We also identified natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a critical source of clean firm power and outlined stringent safety and environmental criteria we look for in potential CCS projects.

Today we're excited to announce a first-of-its kind corporate agreement to support a gas power plant with CCS. Broadwing Energy, located in Decatur, Illinois, will capture and permanently store approximately 90% of its CO2 emissions. By agreeing to buy most of the power it generates, Google is helping get this new, baseload power source built and connected to the regional grid that supports our data centers.

We hope it will accelerate the path for CCS technology to become more accessible and affordable globally, helping to increase generating capacity while enabling emission reductions.

What is CCS?

If, like some of our data centers, you’re connected to the U.S. grid today, some of the power you consume comes from natural gas generation. CCS holds the promise to significantly reduce carbon emissions from gas power plants and provide clean, reliable power to electricity grids.

CCS works by capturing CO2 from a power plant or industrial facility and permanently storing it deep underground. Leading global institutions like The International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agree that it is a valuable tool, because it can significantly reduce emissions from power generation and carbon-intensive industries like steel manufacturing and cement production.

Broadwing is the first project in a longer-term collaboration with project developer Low Carbon Infrastructure (LCI), a portfolio company of leading infrastructure investor, I Squared Capital, to develop future CCS facilities in the U.S. and demonstrate how to deploy CCS projects for power generation at commercial scale.

How does the Broadwing project work?

The Broadwing project is located at an industrial facility run by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which has nearly a decade of experience safely storing CO2 from ethanol production. A new power plant with over 400 MW of generating capacity will be built on site, and the CO2 it generates will be permanently stored in ADM’s adjacent EPA-approved Class VI sequestration facilities more than a mile underground.

We look forward to helping Broadwing achieve commercial operation by early 2030. LCI has already engaged a broad range of community stakeholders in the development of the project and will continue to do so throughout its lifecycle. Broadwing is designed to meet rigorous safety and environmental standards and will bring significant benefits to the local community, including creating an estimated 750 full-time jobs over the next four years and supporting dozens of permanent jobs once the plant is running.

What’s next?

Our goal is to help bring promising new CCS solutions to the market while learning and innovating quickly — the same approach we’ve taken with other energy technologies. Our collaboration with LCI will help fast-track critical technical and operational improvements, from continuing to raise CO2 capture rates to improving system performance and economics.

Transparency will also be critical to ensure the environmental integrity of our projects. That’s why the project will incorporate a newly-released standard for CCS-specific Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs), developed by industry experts to ensure CCS projects can be accurately quantified in emissions reporting.",Blog.google,2025-10-23T14:00:00Z,https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/first-carbon-capture-storage-project/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:41.189574

Trump to Set Price Floors to Prevent Prices from Falling Too Low,"Bessent mentioned seven price floor areas in a CNBC interview but did not name them.

Price Floors Across a Range of Industries

The discussion of price floors is in relation to the US trade war with China, especially rare earth metals.

However, it’s not just rare earths.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “We’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again. And we’re going to do it across a range of industries.”

CNBC reports Trump administration will set price floors across range of industries to combat China, Bessent says

“When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,” Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.

“So we’re going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn’t happen again and we’re going to do it across a range of industries,” the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths.

China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.

The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing’s rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.

The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. “We do have to be very careful not to overreach,” he said.

What’s Strategic?

Please recall Trump labeled movies a national security threat.

With Trump, even the absurd is strategic.

“We have things that are more powerful than the rare earth export controls that the Chinese want to put on,” said Bessent.

Uh… like what? And if so, why back down?

U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China

The New York Times reports U.S. to Take Control of More Companies to Counter China

The Trump administration is seeking to counter new economic measures from China by exerting more control over American companies in key strategic sectors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Wednesday.

The approach marks a new era of industrial policy in the United States, a contrast to how policymakers have traditionally valued free markets and open investment. But as China’s dominance over the production of rare-earth minerals and battery technology grows, President Trump wants to take a page out of Beijing’s economic strategy. By taking more stakes in American companies that specialize in areas deemed critical to national security, the Trump administration aims to exert more control over what they produce. The goal is for the U.S. to become less reliant on China for sensitive technology that it has been using as leverage in trade negotiations.

On Friday, Mr. Trump responded by threatening to put an additional 100 percent tariff on products from China on Nov. 1 and cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. After the announcements caused the stock market to plummet, Mr. Trump quickly qualified his statements. He said he might meet Mr. Xi anyway and wrote on social media on Sunday, “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!”

The Treasury secretary pointed to China’s announcement last week of new export controls on rare-earth minerals as a reason the United States must exert more state control over corporations. “When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said.

Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration had identified seven industries that it considered of strategic importance where the United States could seek to exert more government control. He pointed specifically to the defense sector, where in some cases the U.S. government is the largest or only customer of certain companies, and said that the administration could insist that companies spend more money on research and less on stock buybacks.

“I do think our defense companies are woefully behind in terms of deliveries,” Mr. Bessent said.

The United States would use “price floors” and “forward buying” across a “range of industries,” he added, to ensure that China does not dominate other sectors the way it has with the processing and refining of rare earths.

The push for greater government control over the private sector is a policy that he has criticized in the past.

Last year, Mr. Bessent delivered a speech at the Manhattan Institute deriding the Biden administration’s subsidies of strategic sectors such as semiconductors as “central planning.” At a news conference at the Treasury Department on Wednesday, Mr. Bessent scolded China for deploying similar tactics.

“They are a state economy,” Mr. Bessent said. “We are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.”

The countries have also clashed over a U.S. move to impose fees on Chinese-owned ships docking in American ports, a policy U.S. officials say is geared at revitalizing American shipbuilding. Non-Chinese shipping lines must also pay the fees when they send Chinese-built ships to American ports. Those went into effect on Tuesday.

Agreement With Bessent

“When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies,” Mr. Bessent said.

Q: I totally agree. But what is Trump’s approach?

A: Terrorize allies with tariffs and threats, especially Canada and Mexico.

I propose the US expand trade with allies. Specifically, the US should work out a deal for Canada to produce rare earths and Mexico to process them.

Canada has vast areas of land to mine and Mexico has cheap labor. Instead, Trump has punished allies as much as China.

“Our relationship will never again be what it was,” said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Irony of the Day

“They are a state economy,” Bessent said. Note the the direction Trump is taking the US.

Here is a list of US government involvement.

Trump’s Takeover of US Businesses

The government has a 10% equity stake in Intel (INTC)

The government has a 15% equity stake in MP Materials (MP)

The government has a 10% equity stake in Lithium Americas (LAC)

The government has a 10% equity stake in Trilogy Metals (TMC)

The government has a “golden share” in US Steel Corporation (USS)

After the launch of the $TRUMP memecoin, Trump’s wife Melania launched her own meme coin, $Melania on January 19, 2025

Nvidia (NVDA) agreed to pay 15% of revenues from chip sales to China to the U.S.

AMD agreed to pay 15% of revenues from chip sales to China to the U.S.

Trump started a government website for prescriptions called TrumpRx.gov.

Trump wants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to subsidize homebuilders

“We do have to be very careful not to overreach,” said Bessent.

OK, what constitutes “overreach”?

Movies Are Now a National Security Threat

On May 4, 2025 I commented Movies Are Now a National Security Threat, 100 Percent Tariffs Announced

Hooray for Hollywood!

Just when you thought national security threats could not get any stupider, Trump says Hollywood ‘dying’; orders 100% tariff on non-US movies to save Hollywood.

Subsidize Home Builders

Please note Trump and Pulte Now Want Fannie Mae to Subsidize Home Builders

Trump’s economic illiteracy and disrespect of moral hazards have no bounds.

US and Canada Have a New Spat Over Auto Tariffs

On October 12, 2025, I noted US and Canada Have a New Spat Over Auto Tariffs

“He [Canadian Prime Minister Mak Carney] wants to make cars, we want to make cars, and we’re in competition,” Trump said in the Oval Office as he sat next to Carney. “And the advantage we have is, we have this massive market.”

Trump’s Myopic View of Trade

Trump views trade as having a winner and a loser.

But other than coercion or force, both sides believe they benefit from a deal or there is no deal.

The US could be and should be expanding our relationship with Canada and Mexico. Instead, Trump destroyed it.

Meanwhile Bessent says “we have to be sufficient with our allies.”

How about practicing that instead of punishing them?

‘I Swear’: Kirk Jones’ Biopic Of Tourette Syndrome Campaigner John Davidson Is A Record-Breaking Look At A Unique Life – Global Breakouts,"Welcome to Global Breakouts, Deadline’s fortnightly strand in which we shine a spotlight on the TV shows and films killing it in their local territories. The industry is as globalized as it’s ever been, but breakout hits are emerging in pockets of the world all the time and it can be hard to keep track. That’s why we’re doing the hard work for you.

After world premiering in Toronto last month, I Swear, Kirk Jones’ biographical comedy drama based on the life of notable Tourette Syndrome campaigner John Davidson, released in the UK and Ireland on October 10 via Studiocanal. Upon release, it nabbed an unprecedented 87% ‘Excellent’ comScore PostTrak rating — the most highly rated film by cinema audiences in the UK since records began, above such blockbusters and Oscar winners as Bohemian Rhapsody, Top Gun: Maverick and Parasite. On Rotten Tomatoes, it’s carrying a 100% Fresh rating from critics and a 100% audience score. Since its debut, I Swear has played in the No. 1 spot at the UK/Ireland box office during the midweeks. Through Wednesday, the roughly $5M-budgeted film is at £3.34M ($4.46M).

Name: I Swear

Country: UK

Producer: Tempo Productions, One Story High

Distributor: Studiocanal (UK)

International Sales: Bankside

For fans of: Billy Elliot, The King’s Speech, Coda

Written and directed by Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Divine, Nanny McPhee), UK pic I Swear charts John Davidson’s journey from a misunderstood teenager in 1980s Britain to present-day advocate for the understanding and acceptance of Tourette Syndrome, a genetically determined neurological condition characterized by tics, and involuntary and uncontrollable sounds and movements. Coprolalia, or involuntary swearing, affects only around one in 10 people with the syndrome, according to Tourettes Action UK, although it is often portrayed or mocked in the media as a common symptom.

Diagnosed at 15, Davidson, who is affected by Coprolalia, navigated his way against the odds through troubled teenage years and into adulthood. The film tells his story while also exploring this misunderstood condition. Following its launch at the UK and Ireland box office, it has been both a critical winner, and online audience reviews outranking every other British film released to date. It’s also likely to recoup its estimated $5M budget set.

The cast is led by The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’s Robert Aramayo as Davidson, along with Maxine Peake, Shirley Henderson and Peter Mullan. Producers are Piers Tempest and Georgia Bayliff for Tempo Productions, and Jones for One Story High. Executive producers are Cindy Jones and Davidson.

Bankside has sold the film to about 20 international territories including Australia, France, Germany, Spain and India. Negotiations are under way with distributors in the U.S., Italy and Japan.

Jones first discovered Davidson through a 1989 BBC documentary and followed his story through subsequent docs including one “which showed that John had really kind of found his purpose, and was focused on trying to bring the Tourette community together and to educate them and inspire them,” Jones tells Deadline. In 2019, Davidson was awarded an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II.

In a change from our usual format, a Deadline catches up with Jones for a Q&A chat about the genesis of the project, Davidson’s involvement and the movie’s success. Below are excerpts from our conversation which have been edited and condensed for clarity. Scroll down for a trailer.

DEADLINE: How did your collaboration with John Davidson come about?

KIRK JONES: I went up to Galashiels (in Scotland), and we sat and talked. The first thing he said to me when he opened the door was, ‘Kirk, come on in. Let’s have sex.’ I made a joke, because that’s in my nature. I wanted to take the edge off the meeting, and the next thing he says is, ‘Just ignore it… You know, ignore the tics,’ – but don’t ignore the person. Then I said, ‘Is it what is in your head? We’ve all got this little room in our head, which is double-bolted… Things never come out. Is it like your door is just swinging wide open?’ And he said, ‘Absolutely not.’

One of the things I was most aware of is that the Tourette’s community has historically been teased and mocked because of the nature of the condition, and it’s an easy kind of cheap gag to get someone on a radio show who’s got Tourette’s, or to write a character into a film or TV series who has Tourette’s, and I was very aware that John and many others in the community had felt like they’d been taken advantage of in the past. So right from day one, I promised that was not my intention. More than that, I said I would make him an executive producer. I spent a lot of time with John. I just listened to everything he had to say about his life; he told me the whole story.

DEADLINE: The film can be heartbreaking yet also has lots of humor. How do you walk the balance of keeping it respectful?

JONES: I just stayed really close and true to John’s actual story. That seemed like the right place to start. Of course, I changed some elements. Beyond that, it really just comes down to instinct. I’ve always enjoyed mixing humor, emotion and drama together – You’ll have a very dramatic, emotional scene, and I just love snapping the audience out of that and getting a laugh, and then a couple of minutes later, it dives down again. That delivers what people describe as a rollercoaster. They’re talking about John’s life journey, and the film has a rollercoaster of emotion.

I tried to keep the performances as natural as possible. I knew that from the documentaries when John’s story was presented as a straight documentary story that he was very engaging. It was also funny and emotional. You didn’t need to try hard on top of that.

DEADLINE: And in terms of the casting, was there ever a time you considered having a person with Tourette’s playing John’s role?

JONES: Yes, I thought, ‘Is it possible, on a film set, which is essentially nothing more than a military operation, to put someone who has Tourette’s in that situation? And then I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if John played himself in the last 20 minutes? From getting the MBE through to the end.’

I’ve worked with non-actors before with some success, and I’ve enjoyed that process. I wrote four or five bespoke scenes to shoot with John, and this is what I learned: Trying to suppress [the condition] or not suppress it is incredibly exhausting. After about 45 minutes of working each day, John was saying, ‘Have we finished now, can I go home?’ He was really tired.

The one key thing that made me feel really uncomfortable was, I said, ‘Look, you’re talking with Dottie (Peake), and I want you to say, “Fuck the Queen,”’” because that’s how it will end up being in the script.’ [Davidson famously said this as a result of his tics when receiving his MBE in 2019]. He said, ‘Well, I can’t really tic on demand. It comes out of nowhere.’ And I said, ‘John, if we’re going to do this for real, and this test is going to be thorough and proper, you’re going to have to do it.’ He felt really, really uncomfortable acting or ‘faking’ a tic, and I felt really uncomfortable asking him.

After a couple of weeks, I edited the material and I called John and said, ‘I don’t feel like it’s the right decision for these reasons.’ And he said, ‘I am so relieved. I’ve been terrified that you were going to say you wanted me to do it.’ John, very publicly since then, has said he doesn’t believe a person with Tourette’s could have worked within the confines of a film group.

DEADLINE: Do you think that there’s more awareness now of Tourette syndrome amongst the general public?

JONES: We do these market research screenings and then we have a focus group at the end, and someone the other day said they were going to google Tourette’s. They said, ‘One thing I know is that if I came here on the tube tonight and I saw someone behaving like John, I would have moved to another carriage. If someone [did the same] on my way home, I would smile at them and maybe chat to them if I was confident that it was Tourette’s.’

DEADLINE: You have some big credits with studio pictures, so why this sort of pivot?

JONES: I was really looking to make a low-budget British film that I had complete control over. Having made films for 30 years or so at different levels, I knew that that’s when I’m happiest – when I’m the most creative, and when I jump out of bed in the morning and don’t have to answer to a dozen people in a studio.

DEADLINE: And yet the independent sector is facing some serious challenges in today’s climate.

JONES: Probably six people contacted me just before the release of the film, and they said, ‘You do realize that the British film industry is watching the performance of your film this weekend, don’t you?’ I didn’t quite understand. And they said, ‘If I Swear doesn’t work, it’s a real problem for the future of the British film industry. It’s a homegrown story. It’s a British crew.’

We screened it to 2,600 people, and 100% said they’d recommend it, so it’s got word of mouth, on paper anyway, going into the cinemas. We had Studiocanal releasing on 650 screens – pretty unheard of for a low-budget British movie – so you couldn’t blame anything on that. It had great P&A and marketing, and we’d started screening it like three months before the release, so essentially, on paper, it ticked every single box. People were effectively saying the elements were in place and if the British public did not come to the cinemas to watch it, any financier moving forward would about other films, ‘I like that project, but I Swear had everything going for it, and look what happened.’ It’s reassuring that the public are actually still interested in, and prepared to come out and go to the cinema to see homegrown films.

DEADLINE: And were you ultimately surprised by that response in the UK?

JONES: It doesn’t always work, but it seems that on this occasion, we might have touched a nerve in some way. We live in a world where we could probably all do with respecting and considering other people, en masse. This reminds people that their normal isn’t always the same as someone else’s normal.

People are missing projects that feel unique, different or new or fresh. One of the reasons is that the people who are making the decisions and commissioning the projects have for many years now been playing very, very safe, with all of the remakes. Fresh is something which isn’t coming along very often.",Deadline,2025-10-23T14:00:00Z,http://deadline.com/2025/10/i-swear-kirk-tourette-syndrome-campaigner-global-breakouts-1236593919/,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:24:47.305097
Unpacking the link between flexible work arrangements and job stress: The mediating role of Job satisfaction among highly educated employees,"Abstract

The main objective of this research was to investigate the mediating role of Job satisfaction in the relationship between flexible working arrangements (FWAs) and Job stress. The main research question is: what is the nature of the effect of flexible working arrangements on Job stress and Job satisfaction, the effect of Job satisfaction on Job stress and the role of Job satisfaction as mediation in the relationship between FWAs and Job stress? The methodology consists of theoretical and empirical parts. The empirical research was performed on a sample of 448 highly educated employees who operate in Serbia. Sample collection lasted from April to July 2024 via G-Forms electronic questionnaire. The proposed relationships were tested by applying PLS-SEM method via SmartPLS software. The main findings of the research are that there are positive effects of Flexible work arrangements and Job satisfaction on Job stress, and Job satisfaction has an indirect effect on the relationship between Flexible work arrangements and Job stress. The results indicated a partial mediation; a noticeable reduction of job stress was observed among employees who are sati.sfied with their jobs because of the implementation of flexible work arrangements.

1. Introduction

Flexible work arrangements are becoming an increasingly important aspect of the modern work environment, especially considering the changes brought about by globalization, the development of digitalization, and various economic, health (Covid-19), political, and other crises [1,2]. Legesse Bekele and Mohammed [3] emphasize that the rapid changes in the characteristics of the global workforce, as well as trends in talent management, are forcing companies to develop innovative strategies for attracting, motivating, and retaining employees. These strategies must become part of management and corporate culture, and personnel at all levels should be involved in their implementation. Pradère and Taylor [4] emphasize that the role of leaders is crucial; they need to lead and embrace new tasks to create a supportive work environment that will mitigate increased stress levels, prevent demotivation, and improve working relationships. As more employers adopt this approach to meet the needs of their employees better, it has become essential to examine the impact of such methodologies on key work dimensions, such as job satisfaction and job stress. Since these are two critical dimensions of work that have a direct impact on work efficiency and the overall experience of employees in the workplace, exploring how flexible work arrangements can contribute to increased job satisfaction and reduced stress levels can assist human resource managers in achieving an optimal organizational climate, leading to improved business outcomes. Job satisfaction and stress are two important factors affecting work efficiency and employee well-being.

Understanding how FWAs can enhance job satisfaction and reduce stress can help organizations optimize their work environment, resulting in better business performance and increased competitiveness in the market. Additionally, the mediating role of job satisfaction in the relationship between FWAs and job stress offers further insight into how these changes impact employees’ emotional and psychological state. Researching these relationships is significant for theoretical understanding and practical implementation in organizations striving to establish a healthy and productive work environment. Previous studies indicate that there is no universal and unambiguous approach to the implementation of FWAs, as their application largely depends on the institutional framework, the socio-economic context of a given country, and the organizational culture itself [3]. This heterogeneity suggests that FWAs cannot be uniformly applied across different countries, which additionally creates a research gap in understanding specific national and regional factors that shape the effects of these arrangements on job satisfaction and job stress. It is therefore necessary to pay special attention to examining this issue in transitional and post-socialist economies such as Serbia, where FWAs are still not sufficiently developed or institutionally embedded.

Therefore, this study aims to provide relevant data and recommendations that can aid in shaping future work policies, particularly in the context of the growing need to balance professional obligations and employees’ personal lives in development country of Serbia. Creating a healthy organizational culture can positively impact employees, as they feel they are creating value through their work, with the role of managerial support being of great importance. Garai-Fodor and Jäckel [5] emphasize that a healthy organizational culture can be based on openness and trust. Every organization should create an adequate organizational culture with the goal of becoming a desirable company to reduce job stress, turnover intentions etc., Habib et al. [6] emphasized that a company must satisfy its numerous stakeholders (including employee satisfaction) to prevent the formation of negative perceptions about its business operations. Piwowar-Sulej et al. [7] emphasizes that the mission of HRM is to support the organization in achieving its goals through the implementation of HR strategies that will positively influence the promotion of employee development, better relationships between employees, and so on. Adequate HRM is focused on the performance of employees, teams, or the entire organization [8]. Therefore, it is essential for managers at all levels to develop adequate strategies and positively impact the reduction of stress and turnover intentions, which are some of the main organizational challenges in today’s post-COVID business environment.

The paper is structured into three main sections. The first section focuses on the theoretical background of the research, where the authors reviewed professional literature on the topics of Flexible work arrangements, Job satisfaction, and Job stress. Following this, the authors examined previous theoretical and empirical findings on the relationships between FWAs and Job stress, FWAs and Job satisfaction, Job satisfaction and Job stress, as well as the mediation role of Job satisfaction between FWAs and Job stress, and based on this, they created the conceptual framework for the research. This conceptual framework has not been explored in Serbia or beyond, making it a significant scientific contribution to the research field. The next section is dedicated to the research methodology, where the authors provide an overview and explanation of the questionnaire used for data collection and sampling procedures. Then, the research sample on which the relationships were examined is examined in the subsequent section. The third main section focuses on analysing and discussing the obtained data. The authors applied the PLS-SEM method using the SmartPLS statistical software for data processing. In this section, the research hypotheses were tested based on previous theoretical and empirical findings by other authors. The aim was to determine whether the hypotheses were confirmed within the sample formed in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The following section pertains to the concluding considerations, where the authors summarized the research and provided recommendations to companies on how they can positively influence increased job satisfaction and reduce employee job stress.

2. Theoretical background

The second part focuses on the theoretical explanation of the variables to be studied: Flexible work arrangements, Job satisfaction, and Job stress. This is followed by a review of existing theoretical and empirical findings on the relationships between FWAs, Job satisfaction, and Job stress, as well as the mediating role of Job satisfaction in the relationship between Flexible work arrangements and Job stress. Based on the review of previous research, the authors have developed a conceptual framework for the study, presented at the end of this section.

2.1. Flexible work arrangements

Flexible work arrangements represent a set of work practices that provide employees with greater flexibility and freedom regarding the location and timing of their work activities [9]. These arrangements deviate from the traditional work model with fixed hours and location, allowing employees to align their work obligations with personal needs and lifestyle [10]. They represent a modern way of working that is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide due to its advantages. The most significant theoretical foundation of FWAs is the social exchange theory (SET), which suggests that individuals engage in social relationships and interactions with others based on perceived exchanges of rewards and costs. In FWAs, mutual benefits are expected for both employees and the organization. According to SET, employees perceive FWAs as a form of reward that can improve work-life balance (WLB), create overall well-being, and positively influence attitudes and behaviour [11,12]. Employees assess the rewards they receive for their work, considering whether they are proportional to the costs and inputs they bear. For instance, an employee might perceive injustice if required to work longer hours or feel isolated due to remote work without adequate compensation, leading to dissatisfaction and reduced employee commitment [13].

Additionally, they need to provide the necessary resources, training, and effective communication channels to help employees better adapt to the implementation of FWAs. Kelliher and De Menezes [14 pp 4–6] emphasize that companies can more effectively manage their human resources through job redesign and flexible work arrangements. Through an exploration of different types of FWAs, the authors identified a classification of 12 types based on the research of [15] Stavrou (2005) and the Cranet international research methodology [16,17]. These FWAs include weekend work, shift work, overtime, flexi-time, home-based work, remote work, compressed working week, job sharing, part-time work, fixed-term contracts, temporary work, and annual hours contracts. These arrangements provide better work-life balance [18,19], can increase job satisfaction [20–23] and productivity [24,25], and reduce stress levels among employees [26,27]. However, the effectiveness of these arrangements depends on the nature of the work, organizational culture, and individual employee preferences.

2.2. Job satisfaction

As an academic concept, job satisfaction has garnered significant attention from experts in management, practical business, and social psychology in recent years. Weiss [28] citing Locke [29] job satisfaction is defined as “a pleasant emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s job as achieving or facilitating one’s work values.” Job satisfaction refers to the level of fulfillment an individual experiences in their job or occupation, influenced by various factors such as the nature of the job itself, the work environment, compensation system, relationships with colleagues and supervisors, opportunities for career growth and advancement, and alignment of personal values with organizational goals. It is one of the most frequently used variables in organizational behavior and can be defined as an individual’s cognitive, affective, and behavioral response to their job [30]. The cognitive dimension focuses on an individual’s evaluation and perception of their job, which includes beliefs, thoughts, and perceptions about various aspects of their work, such as tasks, workload, compensation, and opportunities for growth and development. Boohene and Williams [31] explained that the cognitive dimension encompasses beliefs and opinions about change depending on positive and/or negative evaluations. Erwin and Garman [32] emphasize that the cognitive dimension reflects how employees think about and view changes, such as the advantages, disadvantages, and values of implementing those changes. The affective dimension relates to employees’ emotional or affective response to their job and encompasses positive or negative feelings and emotions associated with work experiences. Happiness, fulfilment, and enthusiasm are experienced by employees who are affectively satisfied with their job, while stress, frustration, and boredom occur in employees with low affective job satisfaction. Employees’ perceptions, assumptions, and decisions to adjust their behaviour are emotionally driven [33]. The behavioural dimension includes observable behaviors that individuals exhibit in response to their level of job satisfaction and encompasses employees’ reactions to changes and their intentions regarding how to respond to implemented changes [34]. Finally, changes in job satisfaction could have numerous positive, but also negative consequences, both for the individual and for the organization [35].

2.3. Job stress

Michigan group’s perspective [36], stress can be viewed as individuals’ reactions to seemingly overwhelming work environment characteristics [27]. This indicates a poor alignment between individuals’ capabilities and their work environment, where either excessive demand are placed on individuals or they are not fully equipped to handle a particular work situation [37]. Lamontagne et al. [38] emphasize that interventions to alleviate job stress have multiplied rapidly over the last two decades, due to the increasing recognition and acceptance of the adverse impacts of job stress on individuals and organizations.

Gupta and Beehr [39] emphasize that stress is extremely aversive for most employees and creates a harmful situation in the work environment. Various examples from several major psychological theories (e.g., field theory, balance theory, and reinforcement theory) can be used to demonstrate that individuals tend to avoid unpleasant situations. If the work organization is unpleasant, there is a high likelihood that the individual will try to avoid it by being late, being absent, or even quitting.

An indirect relationship between stress and withdrawal based on the mediating effects of job dissatisfaction is possible, and studies by [40,41], and [42] have shown that stress has a positive correlation with job dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, the study by Berber et al. [43] showed that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between flexible work arrangements and employees’ intention to leave, indicating that if employees are satisfied with their jobs and can use FWAs, they will be less likely to want to leave their job. Accordingly, it can be assumed that employees who are satisfied with their jobs will experience lower level of job stress. Haley and Miller [44] emphasize that the workplace is the primary cause of stress related to employees’ health. Specifically, the Center for Disease Control notes that “problems at work are more strongly associated with health problems than any other source of stress in life—even more so than financial or family problems.” They also highlight that up to 40% of workers have a very or extremely stressful job. These data imply that workplace stress effectively functions as a widespread health risk. It is essential for companies to make necessary changes in their business practices and behavior patterns to reduce stress and, consequently, address sleep-related issues. Sato, Kuroda and Owan [45] emphasize that working at night negatively affects employees’ health. Consequently, according to the Labor Law of the Republic of Serbia [46], Article 108, employees have the right to an increased salary, as determined by the general act and employment contract, for night work if such work is not accounted for when determining the base salary, by at least 26% of the base amount.

2.4. Relationship between Flexible work arrangements and Job stress

Russell, O’Connell and McGinnity [47] highlight that the recent rapid economic growth in Ireland has led to an increase in the number of employed women, which has, in turn, led to a rise in the proportion of dual-earner families. Consequently, these changes have brought the issue of adequately WLB to the forefront. FWAs in organisations have been identified as one of the important WLB and employees commitments. The results indicate that part-time and flexi-time reduce work pressure and work-life conflict, while home-based work is associated with higher levels of both. The authors emphasize the need to distinguish between FWAs to uncover their potential for reducing work pressure and work-life conflict. Parker and DeCotiis [48] point out that organizational pressure negatively contributes to increased job stress.

Chandola et al. [27] found that employed men and women who had the option to work reduced hours had lower levels of allostatic load, defined as the cumulative burden of chronic stressors and personal life events. Among women caring for two or more children under the age of 15, there was a difference of almost one unit in the allostatic load index compared to those who did not work reduced hours. They highlight that reducing working hours for women could positively impact the reduction of chronic stress levels.

Mache, Servaty and Harth [49] found in a sample of employees from a large technology company that the transition to open workspaces led to significant changes in working conditions. Mental demands decreased, while workload increased. Communication, team collaboration, and job autonomy improved, and levels of occupational stress significantly decreased over time. Results from regression analysis indicated a significant association between FWAs, job resources, and reduced occupational stress. These findings contribute to understanding the effects of flexible work arrangements on employee well-being and performance in open workspaces.

Grzywacz, Carlson and Shulkin [50] found in a sample of 19,704 employees from various industries that stress, and burnout levels were lower among those involved in all types of formal flexible arrangements. Results indicated that 30–50% of the observed differences between workers using flexitime and those not engaged in formal arrangements were explained by perceived flexibility. These results provide clear support for advocates’ calls for employers to expand FWAs, particularly flexitime.

Based on the previous theoretical and empirical knowledge of the authors, the first research hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 1 (H1). Flexible work arrangements are negatively related to Job stress.

2.5. Relationship between Flexible work arrangements and Job satisfaction

The results of Xiang et al. [51] indicate that the use of flexi time is positively associated with specific indicators of job satisfaction, with the association being stronger among mothers who had access to formal FWAs. The results suggest that while formality is important, it can also intensify the tension between the benefits and penalties associated with flexi time.

Jung and Yoon [52] found, based on a sample of 277 employees from Generations X, Y, and Z working in luxury hotels in South Korea, that the possibility of applying FWAs is positively related to job satisfaction. The results indicate that Generation Z places significant importance on job flexibility and that luxury hotels should develop flexible policies and adjust their organizational climate if they wish to influence j satisfaction, work engagement, and commitment positively.

Berber et al. [43] examined a sample of 219 employees in Serbia using PLS-SEM, and identified positive effects of FWAs and job satisfaction on employees’ turnover intentions. The study found indirect effects of FWAs on turnover intentions through job satisfaction. FWAs can contribute to increased job satisfaction, which in turn helps to reduce turnover intention. Job satisfaction mediates this relationship, and employees who are offered the possibility of FWAs may experience lower levels of turnover intention when they are satisfied with their jobs.

Arntz, Yahmed and Berlingieri [53] found that employees without children work an additional hour of unpaid overtime per week and report higher job satisfaction by using the “home-based work.”

Palumbo et al. [54] examined a sample of 16,473 employees, of which 54.4% were men and the remainder women, with an average age of 40 years. They found that remote work fosters improved work motivation, enhancing job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and increased work motivation nurture a positive perception of employees regarding the balance between work-life. Similarly, Taboroši et al. [55] found that teleworkers showed higher level of job satisfaction that conventionally employed persons.

Based on the previous theoretical and empirical knowledge of the authors, the first research hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 2 (H2). Flexible work arrangements are positively related to Job satisfaction.

2.6. Relationship between Job satisfaction and Job stress

Job satisfaction is often linked to a low level of stress at work. When employees feel that their efforts are recognized and have a good work-life balance, it can significantly reduce stress levels. Additionally, management support, clear communication, and opportunities for professional development can contribute to greater satisfaction and reduced stress.

Lelis et al. [56] found, based on a sample of 114 managers and using Spearman’s correlation, that stress has a negative correlation and statistical significance with five dimensions of job satisfaction, indicating that stress negatively affects job satisfaction. Masihabadi et al. [57] measured the effects of job stress on job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and employee performance among auditors in audit institutions in Tehran and Mashhad. The results indicated that job stress has a negative impact on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Job stress also negatively affected job satisfaction through organizational commitment. An, Zhang and Lee [58] investigated the relationship between job stress and job satisfaction among construction project managers. Pearson’s correlation results indicate that field managers who were satisfied with their job reported lower levels of job stress. The findings can be used to manage construction site managers effectively and improve their job performance in the field. Marzabadi and Tarkhorani [59] highlight that stress is one of the main contributors to medical illnesses among employees and that numerous studies have shown that many individuals experience stress at work due to various circumstances. The authors’ findings help understand the factors contributing to an adequate work environment and suggest ways to reduce stress and increase job satisfaction. According to Chandraiah et al. [60] various studies have shown a correlation between occupational stress and job satisfaction. These studies have proven that the stress level experienced by workers affects their job satisfaction. This means that workers who experience a high stress level will be less satisfied with their work [61].

Based on the previous theoretical and empirical knowledge of the authors, the first research hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 3 (H3). Job satisfaction are negatively related to Job stress.

2.7. Mediating role of Job satisfaction in the relationship between Flexible work arrangements and Job stress

A review of theoretical and empirical knowledge on the mediating role of job satisfaction in the relationship between FWAs and job stress has revealed a scarcity of research. The mediating role of job satisfaction in this relationship refers to how job satisfaction can explain the impact that FWAs have on job stress. When employees have the opportunity for more flexible work, it often increases their job satisfaction, which in turn can reduce the level of job stress. In other words, flexible work arrangements may directly reduce job stress but indirectly contribute to stress reduction by increasing job satisfaction.

Ghimire, Dahal and Rai [62] highlight that with the demand for greater exposure and better job results, there has been an increase in pressures that affect higher levels of stress among employees, as well as productivity, dissatisfaction, and turnover intention of employees. Burke and Cooper [63] emphasize that, in this context, flexibility in work operations would allow employees to better align their work hours according to their preferences.

Kelliher and Anderson [64] investigated employees’ experiences using FWAs such as home-based work, weekend work, and part-time job. The results were consistent with numerous existing studies, showing that employees who utilized FWAs reported higher levels of job satisfaction [65–67] and organizational commitment [68,69] compared to their counterparts who did not use these FWAs. Additionally, lower stress levels were reported in the case of employees working reduced hours [70,71].

Based on the previous theoretical and empirical knowledge of the authors, the first research hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 4 (H4). Job satisfaction has a positive mediation effect in the relationship between Flexible work arrangements and Job stress.

Based on theoretical and empirical knowledge about the mentioned relationships, a conceptual framework for the research has been developed (Fig 1).

3. Methodology

The third section of the paper is focused on a detailed explanation of the questionnaires used for data collection, based on which the data analysis will be conducted. This section provides a precise description of the sampling procedure and the way the data were organized. The sample is presented in a tabular form and further described to better understand its structure and relevance for subsequent analysis.

3.1. The questionnaire

The questionnaire is composed of four segments. The first part includes control questions (gender, age, education level, etc.). The second part examines the independent variable “Flexible work arrangements,” consisting of 11 statements adapted from Albion [72]. Factor analysis categorized these statements into two groups: the first group consists of job-related statements (“FWAs - Job”: FWAs1, FWAs5, FWAs6, and FWAs7), while the second group consists of family-related statements (“FWAs - Family”: FWAs2R, FWAs3R, FWAs4R, FWAs8R, FWAs9R, FWAs10R, and FWAs11). The third part of the questionnaire measures the dependent variable “Job Satisfaction,” which acts as a mediator in this model and consists of 5 statements adapted from Morgeson and Humphrey [73]. The fourth and final part measures the dependent variable, “Job Stress,” composed of 6 statements adapted from Lait and Wallace [74]. The authors created an electronic version of the questionnaire using the “Google Forms” platform, enabling respondents to complete it at any time and location using their devices. This significantly facilitated data coding and preparation for analysis.

3.2. Sampling procedure

Based on the defined subject and objectives, the research includes employees operating in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. Data collection through Google Forms was conducted from April to July 2024. A total of 448 employees completed the questionnaire, all of whom use flexible work arrangements. Before completing the questionnaire, all respondents were informed of the purpose of the research, and it was explained to them in the preamble of the questionnaire that completion was voluntary and anonymous and that the data would be used for research purposes only. If they decided to complete the questionnaire, they could leave the research at any time without any consequences. It was also emphasized that by completing the questionnaire they were giving their consent to participate.

Data obtained from the website of the Statistical Office of Serbia indicates that the total number of employees in the second quarter of 2024 was 2,367,170 [75]. According to the size of the target population in the research for the year 2024, and by the sample size formula developed by Cochran (1997), it is concluded that for the most applied significance level of 5% and a confidence interval of 95%, a sample in the research can be considered of at least 385 employees in Serbia. Based on the above, it can be concluded that this criterion has been met. Below is a tabular of the sample on which the research was conducted within point 4.

3.3. The sample

The sample consists of 448 employees from the territory of Serbia who use various forms of FWAs. Data collection was carried out from April to July 2024. The authors focused on highly educated, young employees, as they are the ones who most frequently use FWAs. Table 1. refers to sample characteristics presentation.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335279.t001

Based on the presented table, it can be concluded that female (56%; N = 251) make up most of the sample, while the rest are male (44%; N = 197). When comparing the age structure, it is noticeable that the sample consists of a younger employee, with the largest number between 25–34 years old (43%; N = 193), followed by those 35–44 years (39%; N = 174), while the smallest number are under 25 years old (18%; N = 81). The sample consists of highly educated employees, which corresponds to the research topic, as this type of work arrangement is more common among highly educated employees in higher hierarchical positions. Based of the data obtained, the largest number of them have bachelor’s degree (56%; N = 251), followed by a Master’s degree (35%; N = 157), and a Ph.D. (9%; N = 40). Regarding their position in the company, the majority work as professional workers (66%; N = 296), while the rest managers (34%; N = 152). Regarding sector affiliation, most are employed in the private sector (78%; N = 350), while the rest work in the public sector (22%; N = 98). An analysis of the number of jobs held by employees reveals an interesting finding: a significant number of employees work two jobs (24%; N = 108) or more than two jobs (16%; N = 72), while the majority work only one job (60%; N = 269).

4. Results

The research on the direct effects of Flexible work arrangements on Job satisfaction and Job stress, the direct effects of Job satisfaction on Job stress, as well as the mediating role of Job satisfaction in the relationship between Flexible work arrangements and Job stress, was conducted using PLS-SEM analysis. The model includes a second-order formative construct, Flexible work arrangements, composed of two first-order reflective constructs (FWAs – Job and FWAs - Family). Job satisfaction and Job stress are first-order reflective constructs (reflected through indicators). These relationships are depicted in Fig 2. which also illustrates the values of the outer loadings.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335279.g002

The authors first conducted a reliability analysis of the measurement model and then tested the structural model. The reliability analysis of the measurement model involves the evaluation of formative and reflective constructs, i.e., the analysis of the outer model. The formative construct in the model was assessed by analyzing the outer weights of the indicators, as well as their significance, using Standard Deviation, T-statistics, p-values, and the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), see Table 2.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335279.t002

Based on the analysis of the formative construct in the outer model and the presented Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values, it can be concluded that both first-order constructs (FWAs – Family and FWAs – Job) have statistically significant relationships with the second-order formative construct FWAs, as the p-value is < 0.05, and the VIF values for the formative construct are < 3.3. Reflective indicators were analyzed to test the reflective constructs in the model, along with internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. The results are presented in Table 3.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335279.t003

Outer loadings above 0.708 should be retained, as they indicate that the construct explains more than 50% of the variance in the indicators, ensuring acceptable indicator reliability [77,78]. Instead of automatically eliminating indicators with loadings <0.70, the effects of their removal on other reliability and validity measures should be carefully examined. Indicators with loadings between 0.40 and 0.708 should be removed only if their deletion leads to an increase in internal consistency reliability or convergent validity above the proposed threshold. Therefore, indicators with lower loadings should sometimes be retained. According to the authors Hair, Ringle and Sarstedt [79] indicators with very low loadings (<0.40) should always be eliminated from the measurement model. Based on these criteria for indicator loadings, the items FWAs2R, FWAs8R, and FWAs11 had to be removed from further analysis due to their loadings being below the acceptable level. Cronbach’s α represents a measure of internal consistency to determine how closely related the items within a construct are. The values in the table range from 0.711 (FWAs – Job) to 0.885 (Job satisfaction). Dakduk, González and Portalanza [80] (p. 7) emphasize that values below 0.6 are unacceptable, values between 0.6 and 0.7 are minimally acceptable, values between 0.7 and 0.8 are acceptable, and values between 0.8 and 0.9 are considered very good. Composite Reliability assesses how consistent and reliable the items within a scale are in measuring the construct. The values for composite reliability range from 0.821 (FWAs – Job) to 0.915 (Job satisfaction). Hair et al. [81] indicate that the lower threshold for acceptable composite reliability is 0.7. Average Variance Extracted (AVE) represents the proportion of variance in the indicators captured by the latent construct that they are intended to measure. Based on the values presented in the table, the AVE values range from 0.535 (FWAs - Job) to 0.683 (Job satisfaction). Dash and Paul [82] state that the lower limit for acceptable AVE is 0.5. The lower threshold for acceptable VIF values, according to Kock [76] is < 3.3, while Akinwande, Dikko and Samson [83] note that VIF values between 5 and 10 indicate high correlation, which may be problematic. Based on the presented values, it can be concluded that all criteria are met. After assessing the reliability of the measurement model, Table 4. refers to results of the strictest criterion, the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335279.t004

The Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio is a relatively newer approach and is considered a stricter test of discriminant validity compared to traditional methods such as the Fornell-Larcker criterion. Hair et al. [77] (p. 79) highlight that the threshold for acceptable HTMT values is 0.9, with values above 0.9 indicating issues with discriminant validity. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the criterion is met. After confirming that the measurement model is reliable, the next step involves testing and analyzing the structural model. The results obtained from the bootstrapping analysis are presented in Table 5.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335279.t005

Based on the results presented in Table 5. it was determined that there are statistically significant relationships between FWAs and Job stress (β = −0.134; t = 3.522; p = 0.000), FWAs and Job satisfaction (β = 0.119; t = 2.286; p = 0.022), Job satisfaction and Job stress (β = −0.546; t = 17.629; p = 0.000). The analysis revealed that partial mediation exists, as the indirect effect of FWAs on Job stress through Job satisfaction is significant (β = −0.065; t = 2.325; p = 0.020). These relationships are presented in Fig 3:

Source: The authors’ research.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335279.g003

The R2 results indicate that changes in Job satisfaction are caused by 1.4% of FWAs, while the remaining 98.6% are due to other unexplored factors. Changes in Job stress are caused by 33.3% of FWAs, with the other 66.7% being attributed to unexplored factors.

According to the obtained results, it is necessary to understand the benefits that different forms of flexible work arrangements bring and have a positive effect on increasing the level of job satisfaction and reducing job stress. As already pointed out in the theoretical part, flexible work arrangements allow a greater level of autonomy for employees, and in addition contribute to the creation of a psychologically safer workplace, which reduces the level of anxiety, tension and chronic fatigue at work. Due to greater job satisfaction caused by greater autonomy of working hours and better work-life balance, the level of stress among employees has been further reduced, which has a positive impact on the mental health of employees.

The findings are particularly important in terms of the increased level of digitization, the implementation of remote work and greater new requirements for more efficient performance of work activities. It is necessary to further understand this relationship that allows organizations to develop a better strategy for managing human resources in the organization, reduce the level of intention to leave and retain talented employees, and ultimately all this affects greater overall competitiveness and business sustainability.

Conclusions

The analysis of a sample of 448 highly educated young employees in Serbia, using the PLS-SEM method, showed that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between flexible work arrangements and job stress. Specifically, when employees can use flexible work arrangements, they demonstrate a higher level of job satisfaction, which directly contributes to reducing job stress. Additionally, flexible work arrangements have a direct positive effect on job satisfaction and a negative effect on stress levels, while job satisfaction further reduces job stress. The importance of job satisfaction and the implementation of flexible work arrangements in reducing job stress lies in their ability to influence the psychological well-being of employees directly. As a key factor, job satisfaction increases employee motivation and productivity and significantly reduces stress levels. When organizations enable flexible work arrangements, employees are provided with the opportunity to better balance their professional obligations with their personal lives, which leads to greater control over working hours and reduced pressure at work.

This way of doing business not only increases employee satisfaction, as evidenced in the works of authors [43,51,52,54], but also reduces job stress [27,47–50] which can lead to greater productivity and a reduction in employee turnover. The value of the company is also increased, as the FWAs in the form of hybrid workplace are proven to be positively correlated with the intangible assets [84] Organizations should adopt strategies that further enhance job satisfaction, such as professional development, mentoring, and recognition for achievements. Satisfied employees are less prone to stress and are more motivated to contribute to the organization. Trust between management and employees is crucial for the successful implementation of FWAs. Companies should encourage open communication and ensure employees have autonomy in planning their work [85].

Based on the overall research, some of the practical implications are as follows. In the IT sector, where deadlines are very short and expectations are high, the implementation of FWAs can significantly reduce the risk of burnout and increase productivity and employee performance. For example, Microsoft and Nordeus have introduced hybrid and remote work models, which reduced the turnover of young talented employees and additionally contributed to higher job satisfaction. Furthermore, the application of remote work and flexi-time has a positive effect on the psychological well-being of employees in the IT sector [86,87]. In the healthcare sector, which by its nature has certain specificities, the use of shift work contributes to better work-life balance (WLB). During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals in Serbia, as well as in the EU and the wider region, applied flexible work shifts and introduced psychological support programs for their staff, which led to reduced stress and burnout. This example provides a positive perspective for countries in transition economies [88]. In the education sector, employees engaged in teaching generally face high levels of job stress due to work overload. Accordingly, universities in Serbia adopted hybrid and asynchronous teaching models, such as online consultations, which further enabled lecturers to establish better WLB since they did not have to be present at multiple locations [9]. The next example refers to the retail and hospitality sector, where the implementation of shift work and job rotation in line with employees’ needs can further improve WLB, thereby increasing job satisfaction and reducing work-related stress. In line with this, Lidl Serbia and major hotel organizations in Serbia and the region experimented with flexible work schedules with the aim of reducing employee fatigue and better responding to the needs of employees with family obligations [89].

The connection with the SET refers not to the fact that if the organization provides the possibility of applying various forms of flexible work arrangements to employees, they “reciprocate” for example through a higher level of efficiency, productivity, effectiveness, performance. It should be emphasized that if the employees record a higher level of employee performance, the organizational performance will be better, which leads to a greater competitive advantage in that area of business and a sense of leadership arises where you determine the rules of the game in that sector. Employees also show less tendency to conflicts, greater resistance to stress and greater emotional connection with work.

Employers should implement personalized FWAs according to the type of work and employee preferences. They should also increase the level of transparency and communication, invest in a higher level of job satisfaction through the implementation of various non-material rewards such as recognition, a higher level of autonomy at work and better psychological safety. It is also necessary to develop a leadership approach that is based on trust and support for employees. And another very important thing is that organizations regularly monitor the levels of stress and satisfaction using various questionnaires and individual conversations with the aim of responding in a timely manner and reducing negative consequences.

On the other hand, employees should be proactive in seeking flexibility, they should openly communicate with their management about the need for such a way of working. It is essential that they manage their time effectively by setting clear boundaries between work and personal life. They should use flexibility for personal and professional development (in addition, they should engage in learning healthy routines and maintaining mental health). They should build trust with their superiors through appropriate work and efficient fulfilment of duties that are defined when they are not physically present in the office.

Recommendations for future research are directed towards studying various industries and cultures. This type of comparative study could reveal whether specific industries or cultural factors influence the effectiveness of FWAs in reducing stress through increased job satisfaction. It is necessary to conduct long-term research, specifically longitudinal studies, which could help identify lasting benefits or potential challenges that arise after a longer period of implementing these arrangements. Future research could examine how different types of FWAs uniquely impact job satisfaction and stress. Including perspectives from fields such as psychology, management, social policy, and economics can enrich the understanding of the mediating role of job satisfaction.

The primary limitations of the research are the number of respondents, the restriction to a single country, the duration of the study (longer-term research could yield different findings), etc.

Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton share their favorite books,"Ever wonder what your favorite celebrities are reading — whether it’s a timeless classic or the buzzy bestseller they can’t put down? Welcome to Page-Turners, where stars reveal the books that keep them hooked, inspired and up all night. Warning: your TBR pile is about to get a lot longer.

Julie Andrews and her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton have been inspired by books and reading since they were children.

As the “Mary Poppins” actress and Hamilton celebrate their new book, “The Great American Mousical” — which is out now — they’re looking back on the stories that have stuck with them over the years.

“I’ll read almost anything that catches my fancy,” Andrews tells Page Six, adding that she can enjoy a reading session anywhere, “From my garden to my bed, an airplane, or an armchair.”

“Books are in every room of my house,” Hamilton tells us. “They are my friends, my advisors, my constant companions.”

From Andrews’ favorite autobiography to the memoir that Hamilton returns to over and over again, see below for the six books that shaped their lives.

“The Little Grey Men” by Denys Watkins-Pitchford

“My father bought me this lovely book when I was about 9 years old. It is a beautifully written nature study focusing on the last four gnomes living in Britain. This book has influenced my own writing ever since I first read it, and I was proud to help republish it in the States several years ago.” — Julie Andrews

“The Golden Compass” by Philip Pullman

“‘The Golden Compass’ by Philip Pullman is possibly my favorite book of all time. It’s magnificently written, and manages to be both a gripping adventure and a meditation on the nature of the soul at the same time.” — Emma Walton Hamilton

“The Once and Future King” by T. H. White

“‘The Once and Future King’ is a huge book — four novels in all — under one cover. It is a retelling of the Arthurian legends originally written by Thomas Malory in 1485.

Abstract

Climate change is threatening global plant diversity, necessitating the identification of resilient species for sustainable utilization. This study presents the first comprehensive prediction integrating paleo, current, and future climate scenarios with soil and terrain variables to assess Kadsura longipedunculata, a cold-tolerant evergreen liana with economic and medicinal values. Using 158 validated species occurrence records and 15 key environmental variables (climate, soil, and terrain), we employed the MaxEnt model integrated with ArcGIS to predict distribution shifts across the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~ 22 kyr BP), Mid-Holocene (MH; ~ 6 kyr BP), current (1970–2000), and future periods (2041–2060, 2081–2100) under SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios. Our results revealed that precipitation during the driest month (bio14) was the most critical factor influencing habitat suitability, contributing 75.9% to the model. Under current conditions, highly suitable habitats were concentrated in southeastern China (25°N–30°N), particularly in Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hunan provinces. Future projections indicated significant restructuring: firstly total suitable area showed limited change under most scenarios (<±10%), but low-suitability habitats were showed contracting substantially (>20%) under SSP126-2050s and SSP585-2090s, while medium-suitability areas were showed expanding (up to +17.0%). High-suitability habitats were showed remaining stable, and a northward migration trend of distribution centroids, and highlights both the species’ resilience in core montane habitats and its vulnerability to precipitation changes. The findings offer a scientific basis for conserving and domesticating this species, with Jiangxi Province identified as a key region for future cultivation efforts.

1. Introduction

More than 17,000 tree species are threatened by rapid global environmental changes [1], with climate change projected to substantially alter the distribution and extent of plant habitats [2] Studies indicate that a 2°C increase in global temperatures could reduce plant distribution ranges by 16% [3]. Such shifts are particularly detrimental to species characterized by narrow ecological niches. K. longipedunculata, an evergreen liana uniquely adapted to the subtropical-temperate transition zone of southeastern China [4], exemplifies this vulnerability. As a cold-tolerant species within its genus, it faces compounded pressures from concurrent climate warming and precipitation fluctuations. Consequently, it is critical to account for climate change and to identify key climatic variables when establishing new crop research and industrialization centers [5].

The genus Kadsura (Kaempf. ex Juss.) is native to subtropical and tropical Asia, with a distribution extending from southern China to temperate East Asia, with southern China serving as its center of diversity [6,7]. Most Kadsura species possess significant economic and medicinal value [8], among which K. longipedunculata—an evergreen climbing shrub—stands out as the most cold-tolerant. This species is predominantly distributed in subtropical monsoon humid hilly regions north of the Tropic of Cancer, including Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces. Its ripe fruit is a red apocarpous berry, traditionally used to treat rheumatic arthritis, traumatic injuries, dysmenorrhea, abdominal pain, irregular menstruation, canker sores, and gastrointestinal inflammation [9,10]. The fruit is not only sweet and palatable but also rich in vitamin C, vitamin E, and essential trace elements. In rural areas, particularly in Jiangxi’s Lushan region, it is consumed as a natural wild fruit and processed into commercial products such as preserves, jams, canned foods, and syrups [11]. Currently, the market for small berry products is dominated by Schisandra chinensis. However, its strong sour taste limits its consumer appeal in Northeast Asia [12]. In contrast, the fruit of K. longipedunculata offers a refreshingly sweet flavor profile. The total acid content in its pulp and peel is merely 0.03% and 0.02%, respectively (calculated as citric acid) [13,14], significantly lower than the 4.93% total acid content found in S. chinensis. This confers a distinct advantage in terms of palatability. In 2021, our research team proposed the development of Kadsura species—particularly K. longipedunculata—as a promising commercial wild fruit crop, aiming to advance the healthy berry industry in the 21st century [15].

We employed the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm [16] to construct Species Distribution Models (SDMs), owing to its robust performance with presence-only data and limited sample sizes, a common challenge for understudied species such as K.longipedunculata. Unlike regression models (e.g., GLM, GAM) requiring potentially biased pseudo-absence data [17], or machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forests) prone to overfitting in small datasets [18]; MaxEnt reliably estimates species-environment relationships without these constraints. The model also outperforms simpler methods like Bioclim and ENFA by effectively capturing complex environmental interactions [19]. Its interpretable outputs—particularly variable contribution metrics and response curves—provide tangible evidence for identifying key climatic drivers and formulating conservation strategies [20].

Despite significant economic and medical importances of K. longipedunculata, critical knowledge gaps remain in predicting its climate-driven habitat shifts. Research has primarily prioritized investigating the species’ pharmacological properties [21–23], with considerably less attention directed toward its ecological adaptability and distribution dynamics. Furthermore, although the climate-distribution relationships of closely related species (e.g., Schisandra chinensis) have been investigated [24], comprehensive projections specifically for K. longipedunculata remain lacking. The domestication and improvement of the Kadsura genus necessitates the selection of a core species with broad distribution, strong stress resistance, and superior propagation traits. This study aims to fill this gap by employing the MaxEnt model, integrated with Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) technology, to evaluate the potential habitat suitability of K. longipedunculata under past (Last Glacial Maximum [LGM], Mid-Holocene [MH]), present (1970–2000), and future (2041–2060, 2081–2100) climate scenarios. By analyzing climatic, edaphic, and topographic variables, we identify the key environmental factors influencing the species’ geographic distribution.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to predict the effects of climate change on the suitability of K. longipedunculata, a cornerstone species of the Kadsura genus. Our overarching objective is to project its potential distribution range under current and future climate conditions, elucidating the critical environmental drivers behind shifts in its spatial distribution. These findings will provide a scientific foundation for the conservation, sustainable management, and strategic selection of optimal cultivation sites for K. longipedunculata.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Acquisition and screening of species distribution information

The occurrence records of K. longipedunculata were obtained from the Digital Herbarium of China (http://www.cvh.ac.cn) and the National Specimen Information Infrastructure of China (http://www.nsii.org.cn). From an initial collection of 1,177 records across mainland China. Records were excluded based on the following criteria: collection dates prior to 1980, unlabeled geographic locations, poor image quality, or spatial duplication. For records with detailed geographical descriptions but lacking specific coordinates, precise locations were determined using the Baidu Map coordinate picker (https://api.map.baidu.com/lbsapi/getpoint/index.html), resulting in a validated subset of 263 occurrence records. To minimize spatial autocorrelation and model overfitting, spatial thinning was performed using ArcGIS 10.4. A 1 km buffer was applied around each occurrence point, with only one randomly selected point retained within each buffer zone. Following this thinning procedure, and subsequent validation through field surveys, satellite imagery verification, and literature records [25–28], a final set of 158 validated occurrence records was obtained. The distribution of records covered the following provinces: Jiangsu (1), Anhui (9), Zhejiang (19), Jiangxi (46), Fujian (11), Hubei (2), Hunan (20), Guangdong (9), Guangxi (23), Sichuan (9), Chongqing (1), and Yunnan (8) (Fig 1).

2.2. Acquisition and screening of environmental factors

Nineteen bioclimatic variables and a foundational Digital Elevation Model (DEM) dataset were obtained from the WorldClim database (version 2.1; 30-arcsecond resolution; http://www.worldclim.org) [29]. The remaining terrain factors (slope, aspect) were subsequently derived from this DEM using the Surface Analysis tools within ArcGIS 10.4. To prevent overfitting and ensure model parsimony, variables exhibiting correlation coefficients exceeding 0.8 were excluded during preliminary screening, retaining them with higher contributions to the model. The nineteen climatic factors in the last glacial maximum (LGM), the middle Holocene (MH), and the present (1970–2000), the future 2050s (2041–2060) and the future 2090s (2081–2100) were applied to the analysis of this study. Future climate projections were derived from the BCC-CSM2-MR (Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model) GCM of the Sixth International Coupled Model Comparison Project (CMIP6) under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). This model was selected for its reliable performance in simulating East Asian climate patterns. SSP126 (low emissions scenario) and SSP585 (high emissions scenario) were selected to represent the most optimistic and pessimistic future greenhouse gas emission scenarios [30]. Additionally, eleven soil variables were acquired from the Harmonized World Soil Database (version 1.2; 30-arcsecond resolution; http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub/en/) [31]. This resulted in a total of 33 independent environmental variables for subsequent analysis (Table 1).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333824.t001

Highly correlated environmental variables can lead to model overfitting [20]. To ensure predictive accuracy, Spearman correlation analysis was performed on all environmental variables using IBM SPSS Statistics 21. The Jackknife method was then employed to preliminarily assess variable contributions. From pairs exhibiting correlation coefficients exceeding 0.8, the variable with the highest contribution was retained while others were discarded (Fig 2) [32,33]. This process yielded a final set of 15 variables for constructing the K. longipedunculata distribution model. These comprised 10 climatic factors (bio_2, bio_3, bio_4, bio_6, bio_8, bio_10, bio_14, bio_15, bio_16, bio_18), 5 soil factors (t_clay, t_caco3, t_sand, t_oc, s_oc), and 2 terrain factors (aspect, elev).

2.3. Construction of the MaxEnt model

The acquired sampling point data of K. longipedunculata and the effective environmental variables were imported into the MaxEnt software (Version 3.4.3) to predict the potential suitable habitat distribution of K. longipedunculata. The modeling parameters were configured as follows: the bootstrap method was employed for sampling, the output format was set to Logistic, and 75% of the distribution points were randomly selected as the training set, while the remaining 25% were allocated as the test set. For each training partition, the model underwent 100 iterations and was repeated 10 times [34,35]. Model predictive accuracy was assessed using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Ranging from 0 to 1, AUC serves as a key performance metric—values approaching 1 indicate higher predictive accuracy, with scores exceeding 0.9 signifying excellent model performance [36]. Habitat suitability for K. longipedunculata was classified using the Maximum Training Sensitivity plus Specificity (MTSPS) logistic threshold. This method optimally balances sensitivity and specificity, avoiding subjective threshold selection and aligning with best practices in species distribution modeling [20]. Habitats were categorized into four suitability levels: Unsuitable (0–MTSPS), Low Suitability (MTSPS–0.3), Medium Suitability (0.3–0.5), and High Suitability (0.5–1), with the area of each level quantified. Subsequently, the centroid coordinates of potential suitable habitat distribution maps for each period were calculated, and the displacement distance and bearing were quantified using the Spatial Statistics tools in ArcGIS 10.4.

3. Results and analysis

3.1. Model accuracy analysis

The potential distribution range of K. longipedunculata was simulated and predicted using the MaxEnt software, with the average Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve calculated from 10 independent iterations. As shown in Fig 3, the mean training Area Under the Curve (AUC) value was 0.966, exceeding the threshold of 0.9, indicating high model accuracy. This confirms the model’s robustness for identifying potential suitable habitats for K. longipedunculata.

3.2. Environmental factor analysis

To determine the influence of individual environmental variables on model construction, the Percent Contribution and Permutation Importance of the 15 selected variables were analyzed within the MaxEnt framework. As presented in Table 2, precipitation of the driest month (bio_14) exhibited the highest contribution (75.9%), identifying it as the predominant influencing factor. Although precipitation of the wettest quarter (bio_16), elevation (elev), and minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio_6) demonstrated more modest contributions (all < 5%), their considerable permutation importance values indicate they nonetheless constitute significant factors influencing the distribution of K. longipedunculata. (Table 2).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333824.t002

Based on the response curves of environmental variables to distribution probability generated by the MaxEnt model (Fig 4), the suitable ranges of key environmental variables for K. longipedunculata potential distribution were determined. The optimal ranges (suitability >0.5) for bio_14, bio_16, elev, and bio_6 are 40–180 mm, 500–2000 mm, 200–2000 m, and −15–5 °C, respectively.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333824.g004

Crucially, the synergistic effect of bio_14 and bio_16 reveals the species’ dichotomous water requirements: avoidance of dry-season stress coupled with an adequate moisture supply during the growth season. Elevation (elev) indirectly mitigates dry-season water limitations by modulating local climate (e.g., orographic precipitation in cloud belts), with its optimal range (200–2000 m) aligning with humid montane regions. Despite defining the lower thermal tolerance threshold (−15–5 °C), the minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio_6) exhibited a low contribution rate (2.9%), confirming that moisture constraints predominantly govern distribution within the core range. In summary, the distribution of K. longipedunculata is primarily driven by water balance (centered on dry-season security), secondarily modulated by topographic elevation, and further limited by low temperatures.

3.3. Current distribution prediction

The simulated distribution pattern of K. longipedunculata under current climatic conditions is illustrated in Fig 5. Non-suitable habitats are shaded gray, while low-, medium-, and high-suitability habitats are represented in yellow, orange, and red, respectively. The model shows that the primary distribution range of K. longipedunculata lies between 25°N and 30°N, with a concentration of suitable habitats in southeastern China. This distribution aligns closely with the species’ natural range as documented in the Flora of China. The high-suitability areas are predominantly distributed across the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, with extensive coverage along the mountainous regions near provincial boundaries. The medium-suitability areas surround the high-suitability zones, while the low-suitability areas are distributed around both the high- and moderate-suitability regions.

3.4. Past and future distribution predictions

This study projected the potential distribution of K. longipedunculata across six distinct time periods in China. MaxEnt simulations revealed the dynamic shifts in suitable habitat distribution from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present and under future climate scenarios (Fig 6). Compared to the LGM, the total suitable habitat area during the Mid-Holocene (MH) exhibited a slight reduction (approximately 10%). However, this change was primarily driven by a nearly 50% contraction in Low Suitability habitat, while areas of medium and high Suitability remained relatively stable (Figs 6a-b, Table 3). This pattern suggested that post-glacial warming predominantly led to the contraction of peripheral (Low Suitability) distribution zones, while the core distribution area (medium/high Suitability) demonstrated resilience.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333824.t003

The base map was created using open-access data from Natural Earth (https://www.naturalearthdata.com). The depiction of China’s territory in this figure is consistent with the official standard map of the People’s Republic of China (Map Approval No.: GS(2024)0650 cited from https://cloudcenter.tianditu.gov.cn/administrativeDivision). (a: Distribution of Suitable Habitats for K. longipedunculata under LGM Conditions; b: Distribution of Suitable Habitats for K. longipedunculata under MH Conditions; c: Distribution of Suitable Habitats for K. longipedunculata under SSP126-2050S Conditions; d: Distribution of Suitable Habitats for K. longipedunculata under SSP126-2090S Conditions; e: Distribution of Suitable Habitats for K. longipedunculata under SSP585-2050S Conditions; f: Distribution of Suitable Habitats for K. longipedunculata under SSP585-2090S Conditions).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333824.g006

Compared to the current climate baseline (1970–2000), model projections indicate that the overall magnitude of change in the total suitable habitat area for K. longipedunculata remains limited across future periods (absolute change <10% under most scenarios), suggesting relative stability in its distribution extent under future climates (Fig 6c-f, Table 3). However, significant restructuring of its internal suitability hierarchy (proportions of Low, Medium, and High Suitability areas) and spatial configuration occurred, with distinct adjustment patterns emerging across different emission scenarios and time periods.

Under the low emission scenario (SSP126) in the 2050s, The total suitable area decreased slightly (−7.1%). This was driven primarily by a substantial contraction in low suitability habitat (−27.3%) and a significant reduction in high suitability area (−6.7%), while medium suitability area expanded markedly (+15.4%) (Fig 6c, Table 3). This suggests that under moderate warming, portions of the current high suitability zone may transition to medium suitability, while some low suitability areas or newly suitable regions shift into the medium suitability class. Projecting to the 2090s under the same low emission pathway, Total suitable area increased modestly (+5.1%). Expansions occurred across all suitability levels, with medium suitability showing the most pronounced relative growth (+8.9%) (Fig 6d, Table 3). This indicates that under a low-emission pathway in the long term, climatic conditions may exert a marginally favorable influence on distribution. In contrast, the high emission scenario (SSP585) paints a different picture for the 2050s. Total suitable area increased significantly (+8.0%), characterized by synchronous expansion across all suitability levels. Growth was particularly notable in medium suitability (+17.0%) and high suitability (+7.6%) zones (Fig 6e, Table 3). This demonstrates that during the initial phase of strong greenhouse forcing, climate warming may transiently expand the species’ suitable habitat range. However, by the 2090s under this extreme emission trajectory, Total suitable area contracted substantially (−9.1%). This decline was primarily driven by a sharp reduction in low suitability habitat (−23.2%), accompanied by a marginal decrease in high suitability area (−0.2%), while medium suitability area showed negligible change (+0.2%) (Fig 6f, Table 3). Under this scenario, by the end of the century, extreme climate change is projected to cause significant habitat contraction, with peripheral habitats (low suitability) facing substantial contraction risks.

Integrated analysis reveals that Low Suitability habitats exhibit substantial contractions under SSP126-2050s and SSP585-2090s, highlighting the vulnerability of peripheral distribution zones. Conversely, Medium Suitability areas demonstrate an expansion trend across all future scenarios except SSP585-2090s, suggesting their potential pivotal role in sustaining the species’ future distribution. High Suitability habitats remain largely stable, with the mountainous borders of Jiangxi and adjacent provinces consistently identified as the core high-suitability area in both current and projected distributions (Figs 5, 6), indicating strong climatic resilience.

3.5. Changes in the distribution center of K. longipedunculata

Model projections indicate that the distribution centroid of K. longipedunculata remains stable within central Jiangxi Province (27°–28°N, 114°–116°E) under current and future climate scenarios yet exhibits county-scale shifts. Under SSP585-2050s, the centroid migrated northward approximately 50 km to Anfu County, consistent with the general pattern of climate-warming-driven poleward migration. However, in SSP585-2090s, the centroid reversed course to Yongfeng County, a phenomenon directly linked to the concurrent drastic contraction of Low Suitability habitat (−23.2%) and intensified drought stress (reduced bio_14), demonstrating that moisture limitation can substantially counteract temperature-driven northward migration potential. Notably, across all scenarios, the centroid remains anchored in the mountainous regions of central Jiangxi (specifically Yongfeng, Anfu, and Jishui counties), confirming the long-term stability of the core high-suitability zone. This stability is likely maintained through topographic buffering, where elevation-mediated regulation of local hydrothermal conditions mitigates the impacts of climate change. This migration trajectory underscores the critical conservation priority of central Jiangxi while signaling elevated risks from peripheral habitats (Fig 7).

4. Discussion

4.1. Influence of environmental factors on the distribution of K. longipedunculata

Ecologically, identifying the environmental variables that govern the spatial distribution of species is fundamental for understanding their habitat preferences and conservation needs [37–39]. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate, via species distribution modeling, that precipitation of the driest month (bio_14) is the paramount limiting factor determining the geographic distribution pattern of K. longipedunculata, contributing dominantly (75.9%) and significantly exceeding the contributions of temperature and other variables. This finding stems from the species’ inherent physiological vulnerability: as an evergreen liana with shallow roots and large leaves, K. longipedunculata exhibits high sensitivity to drought stress [40–42]. The plant’s survival and reproduction are critically dependent on winter precipitation, a time when it remains dormant. Adequate soil moisture during this period is essential not only for maintaining dormancy vigor but also serves as the key environmental cue for breaking seed dormancy. Studies on closely related species have shown that winter moisture plays a dual role: facilitating the morphological differentiation of immature embryos (increasing embryo length proportion from 30% to 95%) and regulating critical metabolic shifts (e.g., soluble substrate depletion, GA/ABA homeostasis). Under artificial drought stress, seed germination was inhibited by 46%, while the alleviating effect of exogenous GABA(γ-aminobutyric acid) further emphasizes the critical role of water [43–45]. Empirical observations in Qingyuan County further corroborate that the spatiotemporal distribution of winter precipitation directly dictates spring germination success rates [46].

In addition to climatic factors, non-climatic topographic elements emerge as secondary drivers that mitigate water stress by regulating local hydrothermal conditions. Elevation (elev), a key topographic factor, exhibits an optimal range (200–2000 m) that aligns precisely with orographic precipitation belts. At higher elevations, enhanced orographic precipitation (e.g., cloud/fog condensation) and reduced evaporation rates help alleviate dry-season moisture stress (bio_14) [47].

This cascading “moisture-dominance with topographic modulation” mechanism collectively explains core distribution stability: complementary precipitation factors (e.g., bio_16 ensuring growth-season moisture) synergistically maintain water balance with terrain features. This finding is consistent with studies on related taxa like Schisandra chinensis confirming precipitation as the primary distribution constraint [48,49].

4.2. Spatial-geographical analysis of suitable habitats

Multi-temporal model simulations reveal that while the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) exhibited a larger total suitable habitat area than the Mid-Holocene (MH), it contained a substantially higher proportion of low suitability habitat (43.9% vs. 28.7%), predominantly distributed across arid plains. Paleoecological evidence suggests these areas likely represented non-sustainable habitats—supporting ephemeral germination events but failing to establish viable populations due to subsequent moisture stress [50]. Conversely, during the MH period, despite increased precipitation, enhanced evapotranspiration driven by rising temperatures reduced water availability in low-elevation marginal zones, forcing a contraction of suitable habitats toward mountainous regions [51].

Projecting into the future, climate change induces complex patterns of simultaneous expansion and contraction in suitable habitats. Low suitability areas undergo substantial reductions (>20%) under SSP126-2050s and SSP585-2090s scenarios, while showing marginal increases (<5%) in SSP126-2090s and SSP585-2050s. Conversely, medium suitability habitats exhibit consistent expansion across all four scenarios (+0.19% to +17.04%). High suitability areas display minor fluctuations (<±8%). This pattern likely reflects the integrated effects of climatic variables: fluctuations in low suitability zones are governed by precipitation (bio_14, bio_16) and temperature (bio_6). Increases under SSP126-2090s and SSP585-2050s potentially arise from improved precipitation parameters offsetting warming-induced aridity in some regions, or from warming-induced suitability gains in colder zones masking underlying moisture risks. Conversely, under SSP126-2050s and SSP585-2090s, climate change exceeds tolerance thresholds, triggering significant low suitability habitat decline [52]. The widespread expansion of medium suitability areas indicates that climate warming facilitates the transition of low suitability zones into medium suitability status, establishing them as critical zones for distributional reorganization. The remarkable stability of mountainous high suitability habitats (fluctuation <8%) demonstrates the universal buffering capacity of topography against climatic variability [53].

The spatial projections of this study reveal significant geographic expansion of potential suitable habitat for K. longipedunculata under specific future climate scenarios. Comparative analysis of Figs 5 and 6 indicates that substantial new suitable areas are projected to emerge in western and southern Hunan Province, northern Guangxi Province, and particularly along their border regions specifically within the Xuefeng Mountains, Bashili Dananshan, Yuecheng Ling, and Haiyang Shan ranges. These potential new suitable habitats are critically important: they represent probable natural migration pathways or potential new cultivation areas for the species under future climate change, providing essential spatial references for formulating conservation strategies and guiding industrial development.

4.3. Potential changes in altitudinal distribution range

Model projections reveal marked altitudinal shifts in the distribution of K. longipedunculata under climate change, primarily mediated through warming impacts on key limiting factors, such as precipitation (bio_14) and temperature (bio_6). Under low-emission scenarios (SSP126), relatively moderate warming may facilitate moderate upward expansion to higher elevations, while moisture stress at low-elevation margins remains partially tolerable or offset. During the initial phase of high emissions (SSP585-2050s), intense warming is projected to concurrently deteriorate precipitation regimes at low elevations and rapidly enhance suitability at higher elevations, driving significant upward migration and expansion of medium and high suitability habitats into montane zones. By the late high-emission period (SSP585-2090s), extreme warming and potential aridification will trigger extensive loss of low-elevation marginal habitats, forcing further range contraction toward higher elevations. However, this upward shift is constrained by diminishing mountain area, impoverished soil, and potential moisture limitations at high elevations, ultimately failing to compensate for low-elevation losses. This cascading effect will lead to a net contraction in total suitable habitat and elevate risks of habitat fragmentation [54].

4.4. Conservation and domestication of K. longipedunculata

Integrating projected shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable habitats, altitudinal migration trends across climate scenarios, and centroid displacement characteristics, we propose comprehensive conservation and adaptive management strategies. These prioritize: (1) enhanced in situ conservation within core areas of central Jiangxi (specifically Yongfeng, Anfu, and Jishui counties anchoring the centroid); (2) designating newly identified suitable habitats in western Hunan and northern Guangxi mountainous regions as candidate sites for assisted migration or novel cultivation; (3) monitoring population dynamics across altitudinal gradients and preserving elevational habitat corridors within core zones; and (4) prioritized germplasm collection from northern marginal populations and key counties implicated in centroid shifts (e.g., Yongfeng, Anfu) for breeding drought-tolerant varieties. All measures should be dynamically adjusted based on scenario-specific projections under divergent emission pathways (SSP126/SSP585) to implement tailored interventions that enhance the climate resilience of K. longipedunculata.

4.5. Limitations of the study

While climate, soil, and topographic factors employed in this study effectively capture the primary environmental requirements of K. longipedunculata and enable the prediction of its potential distribution, these variables fail to incorporate critical ecological and anthropogenic factors that directly influence its survival and dispersal. As a forest-dependent liana, the distribution and population viability of K. longipedunculata are fundamentally determined by specific habitat structural attributes, including canopy openness, proximity to forest edges, and intensity of anthropogenic disturbances [55–57]. Previous research has shown that neglecting these variables can result in a substantial overestimation of suitable habitat area, potentially exceeding 50% [58,59]. The current distribution range of K. longipedunculata predominantly encompasses sparsely populated regions, suggesting that the magnitude of such overestimation might be attenuated in this specific case. Future investigations should prioritize the integration of high-resolution land use/land cover change data (e.g., FROM-GLC, ESA CCI-LC), the Human Footprint Index, and forest structural parameters to enhance model accuracy and ecological realism [60,61].

5. Conclusion

This study identified the precipitation during the driest month (bio_14) as the primary driver of K. longipedunculata’s distribution, with topographic elevation (200–2000 m) playing a key role in forming a water-topography buffering mechanism that ensures the long-term stability of its core mountainous habitat in central Jiangxi (Yongfeng-Anfu-Jishu). Under future climate changes, low suitability habitats would sharply decline under SSP126-2050s and SSP585-2090s scenarios, elevating risks for peripheral habitats, whereas medium suitability areas exhibit widespread expansion, emerging as critical zones for distributional reorganization. The minimal fluctuations (<±8%) in high suitability zones showed the underscoring of the resilience of montane core refugia. However, ongoing vigilance against northward and upward habitat shifts driven by global warming remains imperative. To mitigate these risks, adaptive strategies should prioritize the conservation of core habitats in Jiangxi and the development of drought-tolerant germplasm sourced from northern marginal populations. The newly identified suitable habitats in western Hunan and northern Guangxi present viable opportunities for assisted migration or innovative cultivation initiatives. This study established mechanistic thresholds for pivotal climatic drivers, creating an evidence base for sustainable resource governance. Future models integrating anthropogenic variables, such as land-use change will enhance the predictive accuracy of habitat suitability frameworks, ultimately optimizing conservation prioritization and cultivation planning.

Green accounting and ESG-driven eco-efficiency in European financial institutions: A two-stage DEA–CRITIC-TOPSIS evaluation,"Abstract

Background

Evaluation of the eco-efficiency of financial institutions and their underlying green accounting practices is imperative as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles become ingrained in financial regulation and investment strategy. Nevertheless, the current ESG assessments frequently suffer from a lack of a dual focus on governance quality and performance, which raises concerns about misaligned reporting and Greenwashing.

Objective

This investigation suggests a two-stage methodological framework for evaluating the eco-efficiency of European financial institutions that is driven by ESG and evaluating the impact of internal green accounting practices on sustainability performance.

Methods

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is implemented in the initial phase to calculate eco-efficiency scores that are determined by financial outputs and environmental inputs (GHG emissions, energy consumption, assets). The second stage employs the CRITIC-TOPSIS method to rank 365 institutions according to seven governance-related green accounting criteria. These criteria are derived from the Refinitiv ESG Screener CO₂ dataset. The performance frontiers are identified by DEA, while the contribution of internal sustainability mechanisms is assessed by CRITIC-TOPSIS.

Results

According to the DEA results, only 38% of institutions are entirely efficient, with a substantial degree of variation across the sample. The results of the CRITIC-TOPSIS analysis indicate that the most reliable predictors of green accounting quality are governance indicators, including the presence of an ESG committee and board supervision of climate risks. According to a moderate positive correlation between DEA scores and TOPSIS rankings, eco-efficiency and green accounting maturity are related, but they are not entirely aligned.

Conclusions

The results underscore the importance of integrating institutional governance evaluations with operational performance metrics to accurately evaluate sustainability. Theoretical and methodological contributions to the disciplines of environmental accounting and sustainable finance are made by this integrated framework, which provides regulators, rating agencies, and institutional decision-makers with valuable insights.

1. Introduction

The financial sector is essential in the promotion of sustainable development, as it allocates resources to activities that are socially equitable and environmentally responsible. In recent years, financial institutions have faced increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and civil society to incorporate sustainability issues into their operational and strategic frameworks. Consequently, in order to enhance transparency, credibility, and long-term risk management, numerous organizations have implemented Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) procedures and reporting requirements [1,2]. Nonetheless, despite the surge in ESG disclosures, apprehensions remain about the efficacy and genuineness of these practices, especially in the context of increasing allegations of greenwashing [3,4].

This transformation is additionally reinforced by regulatory mandates in the European Union, specifically the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). Financial market participants are required to disclose the sustainability-related risks and impacts of their investment decisions under the SFDR, while the EU Taxonomy provides a classification system to ascertain whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable. The objective of these instruments is to standardize ESG evaluation, reduce greenwashing, and improve the accountability of financial institutions. As a result, financial actors are now obligated to align their internal governance systems and disclosure practices with legally mandated sustainability metrics. This has increased the demand for analytical tools that can evaluate the robustness of green accounting frameworks and ESG performance.

ESG reporting frequently fails to accurately represent the internal processes and governance structures that regulate the administration and execution of sustainability initiatives, despite the fact that it conveys performance results. While numerous ESG evaluation frameworks prioritize external measures, such as emissions levels or environmental scores, they fail to adequately address the institutional frameworks that underlie data quality, target-setting, or decision-making processes. As a result, it is imperative to develop analytical frameworks that assess the quality and profundity of green accounting processes within firms and analyze environmental performance outcomes [5–7].

This study proposes a two-stage empirical framework to assess the ESG-driven eco-efficiency of financial institutions and to analyze the structural and procedural factors influencing their environmental performance. The initial phase uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a prevalent non-parametric method, to evaluate the comparative eco-efficiency of institutions utilizing financial and environmental inputs and outputs. The second step utilizes the CRITIC-TOPSIS technique, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making methodology, to evaluate and rank institutions according to specific green accounting indicators, including governance supervision, verification systems, and strategic climate strategies.

The primary aims of this research are threefold: (1) to evaluate the comparative eco-efficiency of European financial institutions utilizing DEA; (2) to determine the green accounting practices that most substantially affect sustainability rankings through CRITIC-TOPSIS; and (3) to analyze the correspondence—or absence thereof—between operational efficiency and internal sustainability governance. This study enhances the understanding of how financial institutions can bolster the credibility and effectiveness of their sustainability strategies, while enabling policymakers and stakeholders to distinguish between superficial ESG compliance and genuine environmental commitment.

The subsequent sections of this work are organized as follows: Section 2 examines the pertinent literature on ESG performance, eco-efficiency, and green accounting systems. Section 3 delineates the materials and methodologies, encompassing the DEA and CRITIC-TOPSIS models. Section 4 delineates the empirical findings, whereas Section 5 examines their theoretical and practical ramifications. Section 6 ends the study by summarizing principal results, delineating limitations, and suggesting avenues for further research.

2. Literature review

The incorporation of sustainability principles in financial institutions has emerged as a primary concern for academia and regulators, especially due to increasing climate-related risks, sustainable financing requirements, and investor demands for ESG accountability. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) elements have transitioned from optional frameworks to strategic necessities, particularly in the financial industry, where institutional reputation and risk exposure are intricately linked to environmental performance [8–10].

Eco-efficiency, characterized as the capacity to provide favorable outputs while minimizing environmental repercussions, has become an essential criterion for evaluating institutional sustainability [11]. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a non-parametric frontier methodology, has been extensively employed to assess eco-efficiency in financial organizations, such as banks, insurance companies, and asset managers. The methodological flexibility of DEA facilitates the comparison of many inputs and outcomes without presupposing a particular functional form, rendering it particularly appropriates for sustainability situations. Nonetheless, despite its advantages, DEA frequently exhibits a deficiency in diagnostic capability, especially for the institutional factors influencing performance [12–15].

To tackle this issue, researchers have progressively integrated DEA with supplementary analytical techniques that encompass governance, structural, or policy aspects. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) strategies, such the CRITIC (CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) method, have become prominent for their capacity to provide objective weights derived from data variability and dependency [16]. The integration of TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) with the CRITIC technique enables a clear and systematic ranking of decision units according to sustainability-related criteria. Recent implementations of CRITIC-TOPSIS in environmental and social performance evaluations have proven its efficacy in mitigating subjectivity in sustainability assessments, however its use in financial ESG evaluation and green accounting remains constrained [17,18].

The theory of green accounting enhances these methodological advancements by providing a conceptual framework that incorporates environmental factors into financial planning, reporting, and strategic governance. It encompasses carbon accounting, environmental cost analysis, and sustainability auditing methodologies that enable corporations to absorb externalities. In financial organizations, the adoption of green accounting has been inconsistent, frequently influenced by soft law mechanisms such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), and, more recently, EU Taxonomy mandates. The voluntary aspect of several frameworks results in discrepancies in disclosure quality and restricts comparison among enterprises and countries [19–21].

Institutional governance is pivotal in determining the legitimacy and profundity of green accounting. Studies indicate that companies with robust board-level ESG governance, established sustainability committees, and verified disclosures are more inclined to generate consistent and credible sustainability reports [22–24]. Concerns with greenwashing—characterized as the deception or embellishment of environmental performance for reputational gain—continue to pervade the finance industry. The disparity between ESG ratings and actual sustainable practices has led researchers to promote integrated models that evaluate both performance outcomes and governance structures [25].

This study enhances the literature by integrating DEA and CRITIC-TOPSIS into a unified framework to assess the ESG-oriented eco-efficiency and green accounting practices of European financial institutions. This dual-stage methodology offers a comprehensive perspective on sustainability, integrating quantitative performance metrics with institutional quality factors, therefore tackling ongoing issues with the openness, correctness, and accountability of ESG assertions within the financial sector.

3. Materials and methods

This study utilizes a two-stage empirical framework to assess the eco-efficiency of 365 publicly traded European financial institutions that are driven by ESG and to investigate the influence of green accounting standards on institutional performance variances. This section elucidates the rationale behind the selection of DEA and CRITIC–TOPSIS over other multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to enhance methodological transparency and address potential concerns regarding model selection.

The selection of DEA and CRITIC–TOPSIS was influenced by both practical and methodological factors. The relative eco-efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) can be estimated without the necessity of pre-assigned weights using DEA, a non-parametric technique that has its roots in operations research. When financial institutions with diverse ESG and green accounting profiles are benchmarked, this attribute is particularly advantageous. DEA’s capacity to manage multiple inputs and outputs based on observed data, without subjective assumptions, further enhances its suitability for cross-sectional eco-efficiency analysis.

To improve the evaluation of institutional performance, CRITIC–TOPSIS was implemented in the second stage through the integration of ESG-related disclosure and green accounting indicators. The CRITIC method objectively assigns weights based on the standard deviation of indicators and the correlation structure among them, thereby illustrating the intensity of contrast and inter-criteria conflict. The entropy method’s primary limitation is that it only considers variability without accounting for indicator redundancy. This is addressed by this. In the interim, TOPSIS organizes alternatives in accordance with their proximity to an optimal solution, providing a user-friendly framework for assessing the ESG alignment of institutions. The CRITIC–TOPSIS approach ensures replicability across a large sample and reduces subjectivity, in contrast to methods like AHP, which rely heavily on expert judgment and pairwise comparisons. Therefore, the integration of DEA and CRITIC–TOPSIS enables a comprehensive and exhaustive assessment of the eco-efficiency of ESGs. [17,18,26].

3.1 DEA-based assessment of eco-efficiency

Eco-efficiency ratings were calculated with a non-oriented DEA model based on the assumption of Variable Returns to Scale (VRS), executed by MAXDEA 8. The non-oriented paradigm was chosen to facilitate the concurrent assessment of input reduction and output enhancement [27–30]. The VRS model was implemented to address scale variability across financial institutions, hence facilitating comparison between enterprises of varying sizes. The model’s application of the maximum distance to border configuration facilitated improved discriminatory capability among units.

The mathematical formulation of the output-oriented DEA model is as follows:

In this formulation represent the input and output values for the DMU, are the intensity variables that generate the efficiency frontier , is the efficiency score, and is the total number of DMUs.

Data were gathered for the fiscal year 2024 via the Refinitiv ESG Screener. Table 1 delineates the input and output variables used in the DEA model. Inputs encompass environmental and resource consumption metrics, whilst outputs denote financial performance and the quality of environmental disclosures.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t001

DEA efficiency scores vary from 0 to 1, with a score of 1 signifying that an institution is positioned on the efficiency frontier. The scores were the foundation for the subsequent phase of analysis.

3.2 Evaluation of green accounting practices using CRITIC-TOPSIS

To assess the impact of green accounting procedures on eco-efficiency, seven criteria were derived using the Refinitiv ESG Screener CO₂ dataset. These metrics signify essential aspects of environmental governance, transparency, and emissions control. Table 2 delineates the chosen criteria.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t002

All selected criteria were transformed into quantitative format as required and standardized by Min-Max scaling to guarantee comparability among institutions. The employed normalization formula is:

Where is the normalized score, is the raw score, and denote the maximum and minimum and observed values of criterion.

The next step of the normalization, the CRITIC (CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) approach was employed to calculate objective weights for each criterion. This method evaluates both the standard deviation and the level of discord (i.e., absence of correlation) among criteria to ascertain their significance. The calculation of the weighting is as follows:

Where is the standard deviation of criterion , represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between criteria j and k, and is the normalized weight.

Institutional rankings were subsequently established with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The weighted normalized decision matrix was first formulated as follows:

The ideal and anti-ideal solutions were then identified as:

The Euclidean distances to the ideal and anti-ideal solutions were subsequently calculated:

Finally, the relative closeness coefficient was calculated as:

Institutions with higher values exhibit stronger alignment with the ideal green accounting profile. This ranking system allows for a comprehensive comparison of institutional performance in terms of green accounting maturity and supports the identification of those organizations most effectively aligning environmental governance with eco-efficiency outcomes.

4. Results

The empirical findings from the application of the two-stage methodological framework described above are presented in this section. Initially, the eco-efficiency levels of the financial institutions under examination are reflected in the results of the DEA analysis. Secondly, the CRITIC-TOPSIS analysis is presented, which evaluates the relative significance of each criterion and ranks institutions according to their green accounting practices. To identify institutional patterns and implications for environmental performance evaluation in the financial sector, a comparative discussion of the two sets of results is included.

4.1 Eco-efficiency assessment results (DEA)

The DEA model’s output indicates a significant degree of variation in eco-efficiency among the 365 listed European financial institutions for the fiscal year 2024 (Table 3). The mean efficiency score is 0.743, with a median of 0.808, and the range is from a minimum of 0.351 to a maximum of 1.000. It is important to note that approximately 38% of the institutions attained a score of 1.000, which suggests that they are on the best-practice frontier and are therefore entirely efficient in converting inputs (assets, energy, emissions) into financial and ESG-related outputs.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t003

Fig 1 illustrates a histogram of the eco-efficiency scores to improve the interpretability of the DEA findings. The distribution exhibits a left-skewed pattern, with a concentration of financial institutions aggregating around lower to moderate efficiency levels and a smaller subset achieving full efficiency (score = 1.00). The disparity in eco-efficiency performance across the sector is underscored by this visual distribution, which emphasizes the necessity of targeted governance and sustainability reforms.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.g001

Thus, the sector’s moderate level of inefficiency is indicated by the distribution of DEA scores, with over half of the institutions scoring below the efficiency frontier (Table 4). These inefficiencies may be the result of suboptimal energy utilization, excess greenhouse gas emissions, or lower scores in emissions transparency and environmental pillar performance. The findings underscore the potential for a substantial portion of the financial sector to enhance both operational sustainability and ESG reporting.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t004

These findings emphasize the necessity of more precise sustainability strategies within financial institutions, particularly those that fell below the second quartile of DEA performance.

4.2 Evaluation of green accounting performance (CRITIC-TOPSIS)

The CRITIC-TOPSIS research evaluates and ranks the identical institutions according to the quality and comprehensiveness of their green accounting processes. The CRITIC technique objectively assessed the significance of each criterion using statistical dispersion and correlation redundancy. The resultant weights (Table 5) indicate the extent to which each criterion contributes to the distinction of institutions.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t005

The study found the three most significant green accounting indicators as Board Oversight of Climate Change Risks (CRITIC weight: 0.242), Governance Board Committee Presence (0.215), and Policy on Tax Transparency (0.211). 0.211

The findings indicate that institutional governance frameworks and formal transparency procedures significantly influence the disparities in green accounting maturity. Conversely, metrics like VOC Emissions Reduction (0.031) and Total CO₂ Emissions (0.061) shown less discriminatory power among institutions, perhaps attributable to reduced variability or more standardized reporting practices.

TOPSIS scores (Table 6) varied from 0.000 to 0.904, exhibiting a mean of 0.355 and a standard deviation of 0.246. The leading decile of institutions exhibited sophisticated implementation of green accounting standards, encompassing comprehensive Scope 3 transition strategies, validated tax data disclosures, and proactive board-level ESG governance. Conversely, institutions in the lowest decile had a deficiency in these structural and procedural components, indicating a shallow or undeveloped methodology for green accounting.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t006

4.3 Comparative analysis of DEA and CRITIC-TOPSIS results

A comparative analysis of DEA and TOPSIS scores was conducted to investigate the relationship between institutional eco-efficiency and green accounting maturity and are provided in S1 Table (Supporting Information). A moderate positive relationship was indicated by a preliminary Pearson correlation coefficient (Table 7) of approximately 0.41 (p < 0.01) between DEA scores and TOPSIS closeness coefficients. This implies that the two assessments are meaningfully related, even though they measure distinct dimensions of sustainable performance.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t007

Institutions that demonstrated robust performance in both models were more likely to demonstrate a consistent dedication to sustainability, both operationally (low emissions and high financial outputs) and strategically (strong disclosure and governance structures). In contrast, a small number of institutions exhibited high DEA scores but relatively low TOPSIS rankings. This group may demonstrate operational efficiency without a corresponding investment in transparent sustainability governance, a symmetry that may suggest a risk of reputational or greenwashing.

The value of a multidimensional evaluation framework is further emphasized by these findings. CRITIC-TOPSIS offers diagnostic insight into the practices and structures that either support or undermine performance efficiency, while DEA gives a snapshot of performance efficiency. This is from a sustainability accounting perspective. These instruments collectively provide a more comprehensive comprehension of institutional sustainability.

4.4. Correlation between DEA and CRITIC–TOPSIS results

In addition to the numerical correlation results (see Fig 2), a scatterplot was generated to illustrate the correlation between DEA efficiency scores and CRITIC–TOPSIS closeness coefficients across the sample of 364 financial institutions. The quadrant grid, which is based on the mean values of each metric, enables the identification of institutions that exhibit high consistency across both metrics (upper-right quadrant), underperformance on both dimensions (lower-left), or divergence between operational efficiency and ESG disclosure quality (upper-left or lower-right). This visual analysis assists in the identification of performance clusters and outliers that may be obscured when correlation coefficients are employed in isolation.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.g002

The Pearson correlation coefficient between DEA scores and CRITIC–TOPSIS closeness coefficients is 0.408, as demonstrated in Table 8. The p-value is less than 0.001, and the 95% confidence interval is [0.326, 0.485]. This moderate positive correlation, which is statistically significant, suggests that institutions with strong eco-efficiency frequently exhibit sound ESG disclosure and governance practices. However, the association is not absolute.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0334882.t008

This result is both theoretically and practically significant. It is confirmation from a theoretical perspective that operational eco-efficiency and green accounting maturity, although they are related, are conceptually distinct constructs. The robustness and comprehensiveness of ESG governance, accounting transparency, and disclosure mechanisms are captured by CRITIC–TOPSIS, while the transmutation of financial and environmental inputs into outputs is reflected in DEA. Consequently, the moderate correlation emphasizes that governance and efficacy do not necessarily evolve in tandem. An institution may demonstrate efficient environmental input-output performance in the absence of mature internal ESG governance systems, or conversely.

This distinction has significant practical implications for stakeholders, including regulators and investors. The moderate correlation is a cautionary tale against overreliance on disclosure-based ESG ratings as proxies for authentic operational performance. It also corroborates the literature’s concerns about potential greenwashing: companies may achieve favorable ESG ratings by optimizing disclosure practices while maintaining suboptimal operational sustainability. As a result, dual-metric evaluations, such as the combined DEA–CRITIC–TOPSIS approach implemented in this study, provide a more comprehensive diagnostic instrument for differentiating between symbolic and substantive ESG strategies.

4.5 Analysis of the robustness of CRITIC–TOPSIS rankings

To guarantee the stability and dependability of the CRITIC–TOPSIS model in the presence of data uncertainty, a robustness analysis was implemented by incorporating controlled noise into the normalized ESG indicators. To simulate the variability or potential data inaccuracies that are common in self-reported sustainability disclosures, each ESG input value was perturbed by ±5% using a uniform random distribution. To maintain the complete sample of 364 financial institutions, the median of each indicator was employed to impute missing values in the original dataset.

The perturbed dataset was employed to recalculate the TOPSIS scores, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was employed to evaluate the rank-order correlation between the original and stochastic scores. The correlation was 0.915 (p-value ≈ 1.09 × 10 ⁻ ¹⁴⁴), suggesting that institutional rankings are highly consistent despite fluctuations in input. This illustrates the model’s resilience and bolsters the dependability of the prioritization results that were obtained from the CRITIC–TOPSIS evaluation. The complete comparison between the original and perturbed scores, which includes variations in relative rankings across institutions, is presented in S2 Table (Supporting Information).

5. Discussion

This study provides new empirical insights into the eco-efficiency and green accounting practices of European financial institutions. The dual-phase technique, incorporating DEA and CRITIC-TOPSIS, enables a comprehensive viewpoint that transcends traditional evaluations of ESG performance. The identified variability in eco-efficiency among institutions highlights the necessity for focused measures to enhance sustainability results [11,31–33]. The impact of governance-focused green accounting standards on institutional rankings underscores the importance of internal monitoring and openness in determining sustainability pathways [17,18,26].

The DEA findings indicate a significant performance disparity between institutions on the eco-efficiency frontier and those that do not meet this standard. While around 38% of organizations operate at maximum efficiency, the remainder have significant inefficiencies, especially with environmental outputs. This suggests that whereas several institutions have effectively incorporated sustainability into their operational and financial performance, others remain behind, either owing to resource misallocation, inadequate execution of sustainability strategies, or insufficient integration of ESG principles.

The CRITIC-TOPSIS study provides a diagnostic supplement to DEA by pinpointing institutional behaviors that correlate strongly with superior sustainability performance. The emergence of governance-related variables—namely board supervision, ESG committee presence, and tax transparency policy—as the most significant criterion indicates that the structural and procedural integration of ESG is essential. These findings correspond with research highlighting the significance of high-level governance in facilitating the effective execution of sustainability strategies and accountability systems. Notably, more technical environmental indicators, such total CO₂ emissions and VOC reduction, were less significant in differentiating across institutions. This indicates that emissions data, although significant, may inadequately reflect an institution’s green accounting maturity without being contextualized by governance and reporting systems. This also underscores a possible shortcoming in existing ESG grading systems that assign excessive importance to environmental outcomes while neglecting the integrity of the foundational accounting and management frameworks [34–37].

This study’s results indicate a complex relationship between the internal ESG governance structures of financial institutions and eco-efficiency. The DEA results underscore a significant disparity in eco-efficiency, whereas the CRITIC–TOPSIS rankings underscore the critical importance of governance-related green accounting indicators. A correlation analysis was implemented to further investigate the interaction between these dimensions. According to Table 8, the Pearson correlation coefficient between DEA efficiency scores and CRITIC–TOPSIS closeness coefficients was 0.408 (p < 0.001), with a 95% confidence interval spanning from 0.326 to 0.485. This statistically significant and moderate correlation suggests that institutions with robust environmental performance frequently exhibit robust ESG governance practices. The correlation is not sufficiently robust to indicate complete alignment, however.

Operational eco-efficiency and ESG governance are distinct yet interrelated dimensions of sustainable performance, as demonstrated by this partial convergence. It is possible for numerous institutions to accomplish high efficiency in resource utilization without demonstrating comprehensive governance or disclosure mechanisms, and the reverse. This discrepancy may denote potential instances of greenwashing or, conversely, suggest that structural constraints restrict the environmental impact of even well-governed institutions. The findings support the necessity of a dual-assessment framework, as relying exclusively on output-based metrics or governance disclosures may result in a misleading or incomplete understanding of institutional sustainability. The quadrant analysis (Fig 2) adds to this by visualizing clusters of alignment and divergence, providing valuable interpretive insights for investors and regulators.

These findings include several implications. This paper theoretically enhances the literature on sustainable accounting by proposing a dual-method paradigm that combines efficiency analysis with multi-criteria decision-making. This integrated method improves the analytical rigor of sustainability performance evaluations and facilitates the creation of more sophisticated conceptual frameworks that connect governance structures with environmental results. It underscores the necessity of treating ESG not just as external disclosures but as an integral aspect of institutional governance and operational decision-making [38–42].

A number of targeted policy recommendations are derived from the empirical findings of this study, with direct relevance for regulators, financial institutions, investors, and ESG rating agencies. Initially, the pressing necessity for mandatory governance disclosures under regulatory frameworks such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is underscored by the significant impact of governance-related green accounting variables, including the presence of formal sustainability committees, board-level oversight of ESG, and tax transparency policies. Policymakers should broaden the current ESG reporting guidelines to mandate more detailed, verifiable information regarding the structure, frequency, and strategic scope of board supervision on climate and environmental issues. Second, the observed divergence between DEA efficiency scores and CRITIC–TOPSIS rankings in a subset of institutions indicates the possibility of governance decoupling, in which operational sustainability performance is not equivalent to robust internal ESG systems. Latent greenwashing risks may be concealed by this asymmetry. Third-party verification mechanisms, such as standardized assurance procedures for ESG reporting, should be incorporated into disclosure regulations as a corrective measure. These mechanisms should assess governance integrity and procedural robustness in addition to outcomes (e.g., carbon emissions).

Third, the results are in favor of the integration of multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that combine qualitative, structure-based indicators (e.g., board supervision and ESG strategy) with quantitative outcome-based measures (e.g., DEA-based efficiency) for institutional investors and ESG rating agencies. To discourage the practice of “box-ticking compliance” and promote genuine sustainability transformations, ESG investment ratings and index inclusion criteria should implement dual-performance thresholds that necessitate firms to exhibit both operational eco-efficiency and governance transparency. Finally, the study’s results indicate that even highly eco-efficient firms may underperform in governance metrics, which underscores the necessity of board-level training, strategic alignment of ESG targets with executive compensation, and cross-departmental ESG integration. To align environmental performance with credible green accounting infrastructures, financial institutions should employ sector-specific ESG governance benchmarks and capacity-building initiatives that are supported by regulators and industry bodies.

Notwithstanding its implications, the study had limitations too. The dataset’s cross-sectional nature restricts the capacity to make causal conclusions or evaluate performance longitudinally. Secondly, the research depends on publicly accessible ESG data, which may be prone to self-reporting bias or inadequate disclosures. The methodology presumes universal relevance of chosen criteria across all institutions, perhaps disregarding sector-specific contextual subtleties. The investigation exclusively examines European financial institutions, perhaps constraining the applicability of the findings to other areas or industries.

Subsequent research ought to focus on mitigating these constraints by integrating longitudinal or panel data to evaluate temporal variations in eco-efficiency and governance practices. Comparative analyses between regions or across financial and non-financial sectors may elucidate overarching patterns and context-specific determinants. Additionally, mixed-method techniques that combine quantitative research with comprehensive qualitative case studies may yield a more profound knowledge of the organizational dynamics influencing green accounting adoption and sustainability results.

6. Conclusions

This study employs a two-stage analytical framework that integrates the CRITIC–TOPSIS method and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to provide innovative empirical insights into the eco-efficiency and green accounting practices of European financial institutions that are driven by ESG. By combining frontier efficiency measurement with multi-criteria evaluation of governance-related sustainability indicators, the research bridges the divide between the institutional mechanisms that underpin corporate accountability and the environmental performance outcomes.

Only a small number of institutions have achieved efficient frontier, as the results indicate a significant degree of heterogeneity in their eco-efficiency levels. In addition to demonstrating optimal utilization of financial and environmental resources, the most efficient individuals also exhibit comprehensive internal governance structures, particularly in the context of formal sustainability committees and board supervision of climate risks. Beyond mere compliance with disclosure obligations, these results underscore the significance of incorporating ESG considerations into corporate governance.

Additionally, the Pearson correlation analysis between DEA scores and CRITIC–TOPSIS closeness coefficients reveals a statistically significant but moderate association (r = 0.408, p < 0.001), suggesting that operational eco-efficiency and internal ESG governance alignment are closely related but not fully synchronized. This disparity emphasizes the potential for a decoupling between governance maturity and actual performance, which is a critical insight for stakeholders who are concerned about greenwashing. The necessity of integrative assessment frameworks that mutually evaluate institutional disclosure quality and environmental outcomes is thus underscored by the research.

The study makes a theoretical contribution by proposing a hybrid model that is reproducible and improves the robustness of ESG evaluation in intricate organizational situations. Practically, it offers actionable insights for financial institutions, investors, and regulators who are striving to enhance sustainability assessment tools and cultivate credible green accounting systems. However, it is imperative to recognize a few constraints, such as the cross-sectional character of the dataset, the dependance on self-reported ESG metrics, and the limitation to the European financial sector. Research in the future should integrate qualitative assessments of institutional sustainability culture, investigate regional comparisons, and adopt longitudinal designs.

In summary, the holistic DEA–CRITIC–TOPSIS methodology offers a transparent and rigorous instrument for assessing sustainability in the financial sector. This establishes the foundation for a more sophisticated ESG policy design, improved corporate governance standards, and data-driven investment decisions that promote a low-carbon, resilient financial ecosystem.

Rivian plans to lay off more than 600 workers,"DETROIT – Rivian Automotive is laying off roughly 4.5% of its workforce as the all-electric vehicle maker faces growing market challenges, according to a note sent to employees Thursday and viewed by CNBC.

In the message, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said the cuts largely involved restructurings of its marketing, vehicle operations and sales/delivery and mobile operations teams.

""These are not changes that were made lightly. With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions. This news is challenging to hear, and the hard work and contributions of the team members who are leaving are greatly appreciated,"" Scaringe said.

Rivian had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year.

The note did not specify how many employees would be laid off. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plans, said the layoffs would affect more than 600 workers, which a source familiar with the plans confirmed to CNBC. The person spoke anonymously because the news had not yet been made public.

Rivian and other EV manufacturers are increasingly facing a more challenging market than they did in recent years amid changing regulations under the Trump administration, including the elimination of a $7,500 federal incentive for purchasing an EV.

Aside from regulatory issues, Rivian also faces slower-than-expected EV demand and a lack of new products until next year amid needs for cash and earnings losses. The company lost $1.1 billion during the second quarter.

Scaringe, in the Thursday note, said the changes will ensure the company ""can deliver on our potential by scaling efficiently towards building a healthy and profitable business,"" as it prepares to launch its new R2 models, which are expected to begin production next year.

Rivian's vehicle sales increased 32% to 13,201 units year over year during the third quarter as buyers hurried to purchase an EV before the federal incentives expired at the end of September, but the company's 2025 delivery forecast was narrowed from as many as 46,000 units to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles.

In August, Rivian also flagged a bigger adjusted core loss this year, expecting it to between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast.

Shares of Rivian closed Thursday at $13.09, up 1.3%. The stock is off less than 2% this year.",CNBC,2025-10-23T13:57:48Z,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/rivian-layoffs.html,Market-Wide,2025-10-24 22:25:01.795179
Analyst Explains What ‘Caught’ His Attention About Oracle (ORCL)- ‘Late-90s Kind of Vibes’,"“The catalyst for the September AI trade was Oracle Corporation’s (NYSE:ORCL) announcement of a 5-year contract with OpenAI for $300B (implying annual contract value of $60B) to host the company’s LLMs at Oracle data centers beginning in 2027. While the market has grown desensitized to these large headline numbers, it’s useful to step back and put these figures into context from the perspective of both the magnitude of spending and return on investment. It’s easiest to start with the amount of investment that five companies are collectively spending on AI. The table below outlines CAPEX spending by the five hyperscalers and compares it with the other 495 companies in the S&P 500.
