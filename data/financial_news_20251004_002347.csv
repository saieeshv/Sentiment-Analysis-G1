New Indigenous-owned sablefish farm proposed for Kyuquot Sound,"Tiicma Fisheries Inc., a venture of Ka:’yu:’k’t’h’/Che:k:tles7et’h’ First Nations (KCFN), is in the process of applying to the Ministry of Transport for a tenure site and licence to operate a sablefish facility in Kyuquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island.

The proposed aquaculture finfish facility is located 11.5-kilometres from Houpsitas, a KCFN village, and about 12-kilometres from Fair Harbour, the marina facility owned by the nation.

Pinnace Channel is the presented waterway for the site, which will be floating adjacent to Hohoae Island.

According to Tiicma’s Transport Canada application (file number 2001-500751), the sablefish facility will include a floathouse, feed barge and 10 cages within a 30-by-30-metre area.

“A compliment of three staff (minimum) will reside on the floathouse to manage aquaculture operations,” reads Tiicma’s application.

Currently, there are three marine aquaculture facilities for sablefish in British Columbia, two of which are active and situated in Kyuquot Sound, while a single inactive facility lies in Barkley Sound, according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

The two active facilities, Charlie’s Place and Centre Cove, are currently licensed for 2,700 and 2,202 metric tons of sablefish, respectively, whereas the Barkley Sound facility is licensed for 550 metric tons, according to DFO.

Golden Eagle Sablefish operates the two active sablefish sites in partnership with KCFN and produces sablefish, also known as black cod, products for both local and international markets.

The licences for all three sablefish facilities were issued on July 1, 2024 and expire in 2030. Salmon farms have until 2029 to remove their open net pens from Pacific waters, but this ban does not apply to sablefish aquaculture.

“Sablefish farms are not included in the Government of Canada’s plan to phase out open net-pen salmon aquaculture in B.C.,” according to DFO.

Sablefish, also known as black cod, are deep-water marine fish with a northern amphi-Pacific distribution and high fisheries value, estimated at approximately $27.9 million per year between 2012 and 2022, according to DFO.

Daniel Rabu, Tiicma Fisheries general manager, says the new finfish facility at Hohoae Island will be wholly owned by Tiicma Fisheries. He declined to comment further until the application process is finalized.

"Weekly economic wrap: Rand gains, but gold is the shining star again as safe haven | The Citizen","South Africa lost more jobs in the second quarter, but the Absa PMI rebounded, while new vehicle sales, especially exports, did not disappoint.

Pattaya, Thailand – On October 3rd, 2025, the Banglamung District Office hosted the inaugural “Outstanding Citizen of Banglamung” selection event for 2025 at the Community Hall meeting room. The ceremony was presided over by Mr. Wanchai Wannaphram, Senior Permanent Secretary of Bang Lamung District. This is to honor people who have demonstrated selflessness, made big contributions to society, and exhibited good conduct in their personal and professional lives, serving as role models for the community.

This marks the first year of the event, which attracted 14 candidates across six categories: Agriculture, Industry, Commerce or Tourism, Social Service or Community Development, Local Leadership, and Local Administration.

The selection process required candidates to present their achievements within a 10-minute timeframe, followed by a 5-minute endorsement from their supporters. A panel of judges then conducted a 5-minute Q&A session to further evaluate the candidates.

The event also featured booths showcasing the candidates’ work, allowing attendees to appreciate their dedication and contributions to the local community.

CME to start trading crypto futures 24/7: What changes for Bitcoin?,"CME Group will extend its Bitcoin and Ethereum futures to round-the-clock trading in early 2026, pending regulatory approval.

The move brings the largest US-regulated futures market in line with the always-on nature of crypto exchanges, a structural shift that could reshape how liquidity flows between traditional finance and crypto-native venues.

CME futures currently trade Sunday through Friday with daily maintenance breaks, mirroring the exchange’s equities and commodities model. That leaves long stretches (Friday night through Sunday afternoon, and brief weekday pauses) where the global spot market trades on Binance, Coinbase, and Deribit without a parallel CME market.

The result has been a structural feature known as the “CME gap”: price moves over weekends or during CME off-hours often open the week with visible chart gaps that traders anticipate filling. By 2026, those gaps may disappear, or at least lose their predictive power.

CME’s footprint in crypto is already material. In Q3 2025, the exchange reported its second-highest quarter on record for crypto futures, with average daily volume near 20,000 contracts across BTC and ETH.

For Bitcoin specifically, CME’s share of open interest has consistently ranked in the top five globally, often capturing 20–25% of USD-margined futures activity. That’s a stark contrast to 2017, when CME launched its first Bitcoin contracts into a market still dominated by unregulated platforms.

Making these futures trade 24/7 responds directly to client demand. Traditional institutions, from asset managers to corporates, have long complained about being unable to hedge risk during crypto’s most volatile windows: weekends and Asian trading hours.

A CME contract that runs parallel to Binance’s perpetual futures or Deribit’s options would allow a portfolio manager in New York or London to offset exposure without needing offshore accounts. It also means dealers managing ETF flows, which have introduced a steady pipeline of US-based Bitcoin demand, can keep basis trades and arbitrage strategies balanced around the clock.

The liquidity implications are twofold.

First, the weekend effect, where spot Bitcoin can swing thousands of dollars between Friday’s CME close and Sunday’s reopen, may fade. That reduces the structural volatility premium built into funding rates and options pricing.

Second, the spread between CME futures and crypto-native perps, already one of the main arbitrage trades in the market, may compress as institutional liquidity extends into previously uncovered hours.

CME said trading would begin in early 2026, subject to regulatory approval. With less than a quarter left, the short gap matters less for structural positioning and more for tactical flows. Weekend gaps and Friday closes will still be tracked, but traders are already beginning to price in a world where that feature disappears.

The brief status quo is unlikely to change market behavior in a major way. However, it does give arbitrage desks and ETF market makers a final stretch to capitalize on inefficiencies before the always-on era begins.

This is a meaningful change for the Bitcoin market. The CME gap has long been a technical feature of the market, one that traders watch and often trade around. Its disappearance would close one of the few remaining structural divides between institutional and crypto-native markets.

With 24/7 CME contracts, Bitcoin will no longer split into “weekend” and “weekday” liquidity regimes, as the same hedging and arbitrage flows that now wait for Sunday evening will be live throughout.

That adjustment could ripple into pricing models across the market. Options dealers, ETF arbitrage desks, and basis traders have historically built weekend risk into their funding curves.

By early 2026, those premiums are likely to compress, narrowing spreads between CME futures and perpetual swaps on offshore exchanges.

That also means the long-running narrative of weekend volatility (Bitcoin’s tendency to move hardest when TradFi is offline) may start to fade, replaced by more continuous price discovery.

"Here are the monthly payments on an $800,000 mortgage now that rates have dropped","The housing market has seen a notable shift in recent months. Mortgage rates were sitting at nearly 7% at the start of the year, but despite some brief upticks, rates have gradually declined overall. And, now that the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of 2025 is complete, mortgage rates are sitting at just over 6.3% on average. For prospective homebuyers eyeing properties in the $800,000 range — a price point common in major metropolitan areas and coastal markets — this rate drop could translate into a significant amount of savings each month.

While the difference between January's rates and today's figures might seem modest on paper, when applied to a substantial loan amount, even a drop of less than a percentage point can add up quickly. And, whether you're a first-time buyer stretching to afford a home in a competitive market or someone looking to refinance an existing mortgage, understanding the current payment landscape can help you make an informed decision on your borrowing options.

So, what can you expect to pay each month if you take out an $800,000 mortgage loan at today's rates? And how does that compare to what you would have paid earlier this year? Below, we'll detail the answers to both of these critical questions.

Find out how affordable the right mortgage loan could be today.

What are the monthly payments on an $800,000 mortgage now that rates have dropped?

If we're calculating the costs using today's average 30-year mortgage rate of 6.34%, an $800,000 home loan will cost you approximately $4,972.66 per month. Note, though, that this monthly payment only includes the principal and interest. Your monthly mortgage payment will likely be higher after the other costs, like property taxes and insurance, are added in.

Now let's compare that to January 2025, when the average 30-year mortgage rate sat at 6.93%. At that point, the same $800,000 loan would have required payments of about $5,284.86 per month. So, the recent rate drop means you're saving roughly $312 each month, or about $3,746 annually, compared to what you would have paid earlier this year. Over the life of a 30-year loan, that adds up to about $112,392 in savings.

If you're willing to commit to a shorter mortgage loan term, the savings become even more pronounced. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage loan at today's average rate of 5.64% would cost approximately $6,596.25 per month on an $800,000 loan. While that's considerably higher than the 30-year payment, you'll own your home outright in half the time and pay substantially less in total interest.

In January, that same 15-year mortgage loan, which had an average rate of 6.14%, would have come with mortgage payments of about $6,811.51 monthly. That means today's rates save you about $215.26 per month compared to just a few months ago. Over the course of a year, those savings equate to $2583.12 in total, and over the life of the 30-year loan, the savings would be $77,493.60.

The 15-year mortgage loan option isn't for everyone, mind you, as the higher monthly payments require you to have more robust cash flow. But for buyers with stable, higher incomes who want to build equity quickly and minimize interest costs, the current 15-year rates present a compelling opportunity.

Compare your top mortgage loan options to find the right fit now.

How much would it cost to refinance an $800,000 mortgage at today's lower rates?

If you secured your mortgage when rates were higher, refinancing your loan to one with a lower rate could make financial sense. Current 30-year refinance rates average 6.64%, while 15-year refinance rates sit at 6.01%.

For someone with an existing 30-year mortgage at January's 6.93% rate, refinancing to today's 6.64% rate would reduce your monthly payment from $5,284.86 to around $5,130.42. That's a savings of $154.44 per month, or $1,853.28 annually. Whether this makes sense depends on your closing costs, which are typically between 2% to 5% of the loan amount.

The math gets more interesting if you refinance into a 15-year mortgage at 6.01%. Your monthly payment would jump to approximately $6,755.18, but you'd dramatically reduce your total interest paid over the loan's lifetime. This strategy works best for borrowers whose financial situation allows them to handle the higher payment.

Before refinancing, be sure to calculate your break-even point carefully. If you plan to sell or move within a few years, the upfront costs might outweigh the monthly savings. But if you're staying put for the long haul, locking in a lower rate now could save tens of thousands of dollars over time.

The bottom line

Mortgage rates have improved meaningfully since their January peak, creating opportunities for both new buyers and existing homeowners with $800,000 mortgages. Today's 30-year rate of 6.34% delivers monthly payments of approximately $4,973 — around $312 less than what the same loan would have cost just months ago. For buyers with sufficient income, 15-year loans at 5.64% offer even better long-term value, though at a higher monthly cost of about $6,596.

Homeowners who locked in rates above 6.64% should run the numbers on refinancing.

'Volaility' should not put new entrants off dairy farming - Tirlán chair,"""Volatility wouldn't be a reason not to go into dairy farming"" according to Tirlán's chair, John Murphy.

The co-op launched a new Generational Renewal Programme, backed by a €15 million support package yesterday (Thursday, October 2).

Speaking to Agriland at Kildalton College yesterday Murphy said that the recent drop in milk price should not deter new entrants who want to go into dairy farming.

Murphy added: ""Volatility is part of the business, in dairy as we all know, and all commodities whether it is oil, beef, or dairy.

Hong Kong inaugurates MTR Northern Link project to fast-track Northern Metropolis construction,"HONG KONG, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's railway operator the MTR Corporation Limited held an inauguration ceremony on Friday for the MTR Northern Link Project, marking the full commencement of the major railway infrastructure.

This project is set to serve as a vital artery for mass transit in the Northern Metropolis, standing out as the largest among the various railway projects currently underway by the MTR.

The Northern Link Main Line will connect the East Rail Line and Tuen Ma Line, while the Spur Line will provide direct rail access to Shenzhen's Huanggang Port, becoming Hong Kong's third direct cross-boundary railway link, the corporation said.

Following the recent signing of the Northern Link (Part 1) Project Agreement, the MTR Corporation is progressing at full speed with the construction works of the Northern Link Main Line, as well as the detailed planning and design for the Northern Link Spur Line.

Addressing the ceremony, Mable Chan, secretary for transport and logistics of the HKSAR government, said the Northern Link is not only a landmark infrastructure project in the Northern Metropolis but also a transport artery connecting the population across the area, providing vital support for development.

The Main Line of the Northern Link is set to become the backbone of public transportation for several new development zones in the Northern Metropolis, said Chan, adding that when combined with the existing East Rail Line and Tuen Ma Line, it will create a loop railway that connects the New Territories with Kowloon urban area, significantly boosting the coverage and resilience of the railway network.

Additionally, the Spur Line will link directly to the new Huanggang Port, offering a streamlined immigration clearance process that integrates Hong Kong and Shenzhen's metro systems, she added.

Rex Auyeung, chairman of the MTR Corporation, said that the Northern Metropolis is a new growth engine for Hong Kong's future economic development, and rail remains the city's efficient and reliable public transport backbone.

The Northern Link is poised to significantly improve accessibility within the Northern Metropolis while strengthening Hong Kong's cross-boundary ties with the Chinese mainland, he said, noting that the MTR Corporation will leverage innovative technologies and efficient project management to propel the project forward, aiming for the synchronized opening of both the Main Line and Spur Line by 2034 at the latest.

The construction of Kwu Tung Station on the East Rail Line, part of the Northern Link project, is currently progressing as planned. The station is anticipated to reach its topping-out milestone in November, with a completion target set for 2027. Once finished, Kwu Tung Station will become MTR's 100th station, serving the Kwu Tung North New Development Area. ■",english.news.cn,2025-10-03T16:07:03Z,https://english.news.cn/20251003/71fac788b75f4a4d8e27b48c50e1e30a/c.html,0.2862745098039217,2025-10-04 00:09:35.292689,0.8999999999999999,"['northern', 'inaugurates', 'fast-track', 'link', 'project', 'hong', 'mtr', 'metropolis', 'kong', 'construction', 'line', 'railway', 'corporation', 'rail', ""kong's"", 'main', 'spur', 'development', 'station', 'set', 'east', 'transport', 'area', 'kwu', 'tung', 'ceremony', 'infrastructure', 'vital', 'artery', 'tuen', 'ma', 'direct', ""shenzhen's"", 'huanggang', 'port']"

Bezos says AI spending boom is a bubble that will pay off,"(Bloomberg/Alberto Brambilla) — Amazon.com Inc. Chairman Jeff Bezos said that the spending on artificial intelligence resembles an “industrial bubble” that could lead to lost investment but will also make society better off.

“When people get very excited, as they are today about artificial intelligence for example, is every experiment gets funded, every company gets funded, the good ideas and the bad ideas,” Bezos said, pointing to companies getting billions of dollars of funding before they have a product. “Investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas.”

Still, AI is going to change every industry and improve productivity of “every company in the world,” he said at Italian Tech Week in Turin on Friday. What’s happening currently is an “industrial bubble” akin to the biotech bubble in the 1990s where companies went out of business and investors lost money, but “we did get a couple of lifesaving drugs.” Bezos also pointed to the dot-com bubble a quarter century ago as a frothy investment period that’s benefiting the world today.

Companies building AI as well as the technology around it, from data centers and chips to applications, are receiving enormous amounts of funding. So-called neocloud providers, that provide big technology companies with extra computing power and access to specialized chips for running AI, are being funded even before they’ve built the infrastructure.

The excitement around AI and its potential has led to huge valuations for these businesses. A BlackRock Inc. business is in talks to buy Aligned Data Centers in a deal that could be valued at about $40 billion, Bloomberg News reported on Friday. ChatGPT maker OpenAI became the most valuable privately held company with a $500 billion valuation in a recent secondary share sale.

Some investors have sounded the alarm on the amount of money pouring into companies in the AI ecosystem. GIC Pte’s chief investment officer said this week that a “hype bubble” is building, particularly in early-stage AI venture investing.

Bezos recommended taking the long view. “When the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions,” he said. “That’s what’s going to happen here too. This is real. The benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic.”

The actual amount of borrowings and the details of the states/UTs participating would be intimated in two or three days prior to the actual auction day, the Reserve Bank said. ""It would depend on the requirement of the state Governments and UTs, approval from the Government of India under Article 293(3) of the Constitution of India and market conditions.""

The RBI said it would conduct the auctions in a non-disruptive manner, taking into account the market conditions and other relevant factors and distribute the borrowings evenly throughout the quarter.

"Executive Turntable: Sphere's Top Accountant Resigns, Plus Big Hassle Acquires Tiny Human","Sphere Entertainment Co. recently announced the resignation of Gregory Brunner, its senior vice president, controller and principal accounting officer, effective Oct. 17. The company, valued at $2.3 billion with shares currently trading at $65, stressed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that Brunner’s departure is not related to any disputes over accounting practices or internal controls. Robert Langer, the company’s executive vp, chief financial officer and treasurer, will serve as interim principal accounting officer until Brunner’s replacement can be found.

Brunner, who joined Sphere in June of 2023 after nearly 18 years at accounting giant KPMG, brought extensive experience in global audits and financial strategy, and has been active in nonprofit work, having served on the NYC executive leadership team of the American Heart Association. He has not signaled his next move.

Brunner’s exit comes amid Sphere’s efforts to stabilize performance following mixed 2025 earnings. Q2 revenue rose 3.4% year-over-year to $282.7 million, exceeding expectations and reversing a Q1 decline. Sphere’s venue operations saw a 16% revenue increase, while MSG Networks dropped 12%.

A major contributor to recent momentum is Sphere’s signature immersive events, including concert residencies by The Backstreet Boys and Eagles, but particularly its ongoing production of The Wizard of Oz. This reimagined experience transforms the 1939 classic into a 4D spectacle using Sphere’s 160,000 sq. ft. 16K-resolution wraparound screen, 167,000 programmable speakers and multi-sensory effects including wind arrays, fog, fire bursts, bubbles and something called haptic seating.

Toll income speeds ahead on M50 to €212m in 2024 - Homepage - Western People,"Gordon Deegan

Toll income on the country’s busiest road, the M50, last year surged by 12 per cent to €212 million on the back of an inflation-linked increase in toll charges and higher traffic volumes.

The 2024 annual report by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) shows that the €212 million in toll income - which includes €12.5 million in penalty income - was €22 million ahead of the M50 toll income of €190 million for 2023.

The 2024 toll increase was the second inflation-linked increase across 2023 and 2024, where in 2024 cars without tags were hit by a 20c increase bringing the charge to €3.70 while cars with video accounts also increased by 20 cent to €3.10. Cars with tags also faced a 20c increase to €2.50.

Across 2023 and 2024, toll income has increased by €39.4 million from the €172.4 million collected in 2022.

The M50 is the most heavily used road in the country with close to 150,000 vehicles travelling several sections on an average day.

The report shows that 1.7bn vehicle km were travelled on the M50 last year which represents a 2pc increase on 2023.

In their joint accompanying statement to the annual report, TII chairman Gareth Llewellyn and ceo, Peter Walsh stated 68.4m tolling transactions across the country on the national road network represented a value to the State of €240m.

They state that over 2m motorists use the M50 and Dublin Tunnel toll roads each year and that last year, traffic volumes across the National Road Network continued to increase, and this growth will continue nationally into 2025.

On the performance of the M50, the report states that the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for the toll road was 158,733 trips, an increase of almost two per cent on the 156,028 trips for 2023.

The report states that in total, approximately 58 million passages were recorded on the toll road which is an increase of two per cent from the previous year’s total of 57 million.

On the performance of the Dublin Port Tunnel, the report states that in 2024, the AADT for the Dublin Tunnel was 26,503, reflecting a 0.8 per cent increase from 2023 total of 26,285.

The report states that throughout the year, approximately 9.7 million passages were recorded, with 65 per cent classified as ‘tollable’ traffic and 35 per cent as non-tollable.

Toll income for Dublin Tunnel amounted to approximately €32m, collected from 6.3 million passages and this represents an 18pc increase from €27 million in 2023.

In terms of the costs of operating the M50 eFlow to TII, toll collection costs, bad debt charges and local authority rates for M50 eFlow last year totalled €58 million.

The overall spend by TII last year totalled €1.76 billion that included €1.54 billlion on the road network and €174 million on light rail and metro along with administration costs of €39.8 million.

TII also oversees the operation of LUAS and patronage on Luas red and green lines continued to increase in 2024 to approximately 54million passenger journeys, representing an increase of 12 per cent on 2023.

Numbers earning over €100,000 at TII last year totalled 76. The remuneration package for TII ceo, Peter Walsh last year increased from €215,000 to €225,000.

Plans go ahead for €35m National Cricket Centre in Fingal | Anglo Celt,"Gordon Deegan

Fingal County Council has given the green light for a new €35 million National Cricket Centre that will host the 2030 T20 World Cup matches.

The Council has granted planning permission to Sport Ireland after consultants estimated it will generate a €93 million tourism dividend over five years.

A planning report drawn up by Cunnane Stratton Reynolds states that during the same 2026 to 2030 period, the cricket stadium will generate an additional €29 million through ticket sales and operational expenditure.

In July, Sport Ireland opened the tendering process for the construction of the NCC, estimating that the spend would be €35 million.

The National Cricket Centre (NCC) will include a spectator bowl with a permanent capacity of 4,240, which can be expanded to a maximum capacity of 12,000.

It will also include a High Performance Centre (HPC), and supporting infrastructure for the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus at Abbotstown.

The report states that the planning application “will provide Cricket Ireland (CI) with a permanent, world-class facility, within the home of Irish Sport”.

An evaluation of the stadium’s economic impact carried out by EY shows that €39.9m would be spent as a result of the 2030 T20 World Cup Cricket tournament, which is to be co-hosted by Ireland, Scotland and England.

The EY findings show that, based on an average year’s operation, the centre would support 460 jobs per year in the period 2026 to 2030.

Overall, including the impact of the Cricket World Cup in 2030, the net impact of the centre would result in 1,555 jobs.

The planning report states that a one-off capacity of 20,000 will be required for the T20 Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2030, and as it is a one-off, it will likely require an events license closer to the time.

A report lodged with the application also stated the economy will benefit from co-hosting the Cricket World Cup in 2030 - where the centre will host a maximum of eight matches, with the remaining matches to be played in Ireland held in Malahide or Stormont.

Planning documents lodged show that the proposed development is likely to generate approximately 200 construction jobs.Outlining the need for the development, it states that “Cricket Ireland has no home of its own. It needs a home of its own. It cannot rely on using club facilities, much to the club's inconvenience and at great cost.”",Anglo Celt,2025-10-03T16:06:47Z,https://www.anglocelt.ie/2025/10/03/plans-go-ahead-for-e35m-national-cricket-centre-in-fingal/,0.09019607843137245,2025-10-04 00:10:00.006234,0.8999999999999999,"['plans', 'ahead', '€35m', 'fingal', 'cricket', 'centre', 'national', '2030', 'ireland', 'world', 'cup', 'planning', 'million', 'sport', 'report', 'states', 't20', 'matches', 'generate', 'capacity', 'impact', 'jobs', 'council', '€35', 'host', '2026', 'period', 'construction', 'ncc', 'include', 'permanent', 'maximum', '000', 'application', 'ey']"
A LEGO Game Boy modder got it to play real Game Boy cartridges,"Okay, c’mon, you knew this was going to happen. LEGO is on a nostalgia kick at the moment, laser-targeting millennials like me with retro gaming sets, including a 1:1 model of the original Game Boy. This is just a model, albeit a fantastic one with some lenticular swap-out cards for different “games.” But since Game Boy modding has been a thing for years, it’s no surprise that someone already made it play real games.

Natalie The Nerd was already a notable Game Boy modder with an online parts and service shop, so modifying the official LEGO set with replica Game Boy guts (spotted by PCMag) was likely child’s play for her. The original Game Boy hardware isn’t fantastically complicated, even by late-80s standards, and its big brick-like housing offers plenty of workroom. Even so, Natalie started working even before the LEGO set was out, estimating what she’d need to do based on official dimensions.

Her final product preserves all of the exterior LEGO parts, including the brick buttons, with only the “screen” and faux cartridge parts modified to the naked eye. It’s ready to go in terms of functionality, though it looks like her test unit may not have an internal battery pack yet.

Some custom 3D-printed parts are needed for the button functions, and there are a few modern creature comforts: power comes from USB-C (inside a 3D-printed LEGO brick) and the LCD is backlit, unlike any Game Boy from the 20th century. It’s running off of genuine Game Boy cartridges, not an emulator setup, which would probably be a lot easier.

The modder is still working out the last details and will release the plans once she’s done. It looks like a great weekend project.",PCWorld,2025-10-03T15:53:31Z,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2929366/a-lego-game-boy-modder-got-it-to-play-real-game-boy-cartridges.html,0.3098039215686275,2025-10-04 00:10:01.745087,0.9999999999999999,"['game', 'boy', 'real', 'cartridges', 'lego', 'play', 'modder', 'parts', 'it’s', 'including', 'model', 'original', 'games', 'natalie', 'set', 'working', 'brick', '3d-printed', 'c’mon', 'knew', 'happen', 'nostalgia', 'kick', 'moment', 'laser-targeting', 'millennials', 'retro', 'gaming', 'sets', 'albeit', 'fantastic', 'lenticular', 'swap-out', 'cards', 'modding']"
Delhi T2 Upgrade: Air India Moves 60 Domestic Flights Starting Oct 26 News24 -,"If you’re planning to fly Air India or Air India Express from Delhi Airport after October 26, 2025, here’s important information for you. Major changes are underway to the terminals at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI), making it crucial for travelers to know their flight’s terminal in advance.

---Advertisement---

Air India has announced that it will operate 60 of its 180 domestic flights from Terminal 2 (T2), while Air India Express will now operate all of its domestic flights from Terminal 1 (T1). This change is due to ongoing expansion work at Terminal 3 (T3) to increase international passenger capacity.

---Advertisement---

According to Air India, these works will result in limited space available for domestic flights at T3, forcing some flights to be relocated to other terminals. This new arrangement will be effective from October 26, 2025.

However, all international Air India and Air India Express flights will continue to operate from T3 as before.

How to identify flights from T2? Domestic flights departing from or landing in T2 will now have four-digit flight numbers starting with ‘1’ (e.g., AI1737, AI1787). This will make it easier for passengers to identify the terminal.

---Advertisement---

Inter-Terminal Transfer Facility

Passengers with boarding passes for connecting flights will be able to transfer between T1, T2, and T3. This service will apply to Air India, Air India Express, and codeshare connections. Air India has also clarified that passengers with flights originating from T3 will receive a reminder regarding their terminal.

Passengers who check in online for AI1XXX series flights will be notified separately that their flight will depart from T2.

Mercury Insurance Shares 5 Homeowners Insurance Strategies for the Upcoming Fall Weather,"Smart Insurance Steps to Keep Your Home and Family Ready for Anything

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Mercury Insurance (NYSE: MCY) is encouraging households to be proactive as heavier fall weather approaches to ensure they're financially and physically protected should disaster strike. From wildfires and heavy rains to unexpected hail, having the right insurance coverage can mean the difference between a smooth recovery and a financial setback.

Moreover, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has noted that more than 40% of Americans are not financially prepared for a disaster.

""Preparedness is more than just stocking up on supplies — it's also about making sure your insurance will be there when you need it most,"" said Larry Anderson, Director, Underwriting Operations at Mercury Insurance. ""Taking a few minutes now to review your coverage and strengthen your plan can save you time, money and stress in the aftermath of a crisis.""

Here's five home insurance moves you can make now to protect your household:

Review Your Policy Coverage: Understand what your homeowners, renters and auto policies cover — and what they don't. Separate policies are typically needed for flood and earthquake protection.

Confirm Deductibles: Make sure your deductible is an amount you can realistically afford to pay in an emergency.

Document Your Belongings: Keep a digital inventory with photos, receipts and serial numbers to make the claims process smoother.

Bundle Auto Protection With Your Plan: Natural disasters can damage vehicles as well as homes — comprehensive auto coverage helps protect your car.

Store Important Information Safely: Keep digital and physical copies of your policies and claims numbers handy in case you need them quickly.

Staples launches first 'Easy Deal Days' ahead of the holidays,"Dive Brief:

Joining the October deals fray, Staples is holding its first-ever Easy Deal Days, starting Sunday and running through Oct. 11, and offering up to 40% off on over 1,000 items for the office and home, according to a company press release.

Staples discounts during the event are available to all shoppers, but there are additional savings for members of its free membership program. Easy Rewards members can also gain extra points on certain purchases during the sale.

Among the deals available both in store and online are 40% off on custom holiday cards and wrapping paper; 100% back in points on all luggage up to $250; and $250 for a Sharper Image S-600 heated massage chair that regularly sells for about $400.

Dive Insight:

Staples is the latest national retail chain to hop on the early holiday shopping bandwagon.

The timing of the Staples sales event mirrors that of other major retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, Target and Kohl’s. Amazon kicked off the trend with its Prime Big Deal Days, which takes place on Oct. 7 and Oct. 8 this year, and other retailers have followed suit, relying on fall sales as a launch to the holiday season.

“Most retailers offering deal days or discounts in October are doing so to ensure that Amazon does not steal all the limelight,” GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said in an email. “Other retailers want to grab some of the action. Of course, this is all the more important in the current environment as hard pressed shoppers are very receptive to deals and bargains as they look to stretch their dollars.”

While not known for being a holiday destination, Staples is pitching itself as a destination for office-oriented supplies, as well as holiday gifting items, and travel and shipping services. The retailer has an eye on expanding its in-store experience further; in September, Staples announced a pilot deal to bring optical centers to a select group of its stores to offer eye exams, prescription eyewear and lenses.

“What feels different this year is how intentional customers are about their shopping,” Staples Chief Merchandising Officer Peter Scala said in an email. “Businesses are stocking up earlier to be ready for peak season, and consumers want to start holiday shopping ahead of the rush to manage their budgets and reduce stress.

Former textiles students visit college to showcase their work,"The private viewing, held at the Wessex Arts Department, showcased the creative achievements of last summer’s A Levels art textiles students.

Friends, family and staff were invited to celebrate the students’ designs, which included summer dresses, jackets, hats and shirts.

Lizzie Henley, textiles lecturer at Alton College, said: ""This group has worked so hard over the last two years, making this celebration even more special.

""I am incredibly proud of their artwork, and wish them all the best for the future.""

The exhibition also featured students’ sketchbooks, offering insight into their creative development and design processes.

Nearly half of the students will continue their studies on the Level 4 Art and Design Foundation Diploma, a one-year pre-degree course that prepares learners for entry into creative arts universities, apprenticeships, or roles in the creative industries.

New Indigenous-owned sablefish farm proposed for Kyuquot Sound,"Tiicma Fisheries Inc., a venture of Ka:’yu:’k’t’h’/Che:k:tles7et’h’ First Nations (KCFN), is in the process of applying to the Ministry of Transport for a tenure site and licence to operate a sablefish facility in Kyuquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island.

The proposed aquaculture finfish facility is located 11.5-kilometres from Houpsitas, a KCFN village, and about 12-kilometres from Fair Harbour, the marina facility owned by the nation.

Pinnace Channel is the presented waterway for the site, which will be floating adjacent to Hohoae Island.

According to Tiicma’s Transport Canada application (file number 2001-500751), the sablefish facility will include a floathouse, feed barge and 10 cages within a 30-by-30-metre area.

“A compliment of three staff (minimum) will reside on the floathouse to manage aquaculture operations,” reads Tiicma’s application.

Currently, there are three marine aquaculture facilities for sablefish in British Columbia, two of which are active and situated in Kyuquot Sound, while a single inactive facility lies in Barkley Sound, according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

The two active facilities, Charlie’s Place and Centre Cove, are currently licensed for 2,700 and 2,202 metric tons of sablefish, respectively, whereas the Barkley Sound facility is licensed for 550 metric tons, according to DFO.

Golden Eagle Sablefish operates the two active sablefish sites in partnership with KCFN and produces sablefish, also known as black cod, products for both local and international markets.

The licences for all three sablefish facilities were issued on July 1, 2024 and expire in 2030. Salmon farms have until 2029 to remove their open net pens from Pacific waters, but this ban does not apply to sablefish aquaculture.

“Sablefish farms are not included in the Government of Canada’s plan to phase out open net-pen salmon aquaculture in B.C.,” according to DFO.

Sablefish, also known as black cod, are deep-water marine fish with a northern amphi-Pacific distribution and high fisheries value, estimated at approximately $27.9 million per year between 2012 and 2022, according to DFO.

Daniel Rabu, Tiicma Fisheries general manager, says the new finfish facility at Hohoae Island will be wholly owned by Tiicma Fisheries. He declined to comment further until the application process is finalized.

Oil Recovers After 8% Drop | OilPrice.com,"Oil prices saw a small recovery on Friday morning after a continued selloff this week.

Friday, October 3, 2025

An 8% weekly loss is a rare occurrence in oil markets, especially if it comes on the back of five straight daily declines. Even though Friday’s trading has shown a marginal recovery with ICE Brent edging closer to $65 per barrel, however it seems that Sunday’s OPEC+ meeting could prompt further price declines in case members agree to expedited production unwinding. Amidst a US government shutdown and record year-to-date high OPEC+ crude exports in September, bearishness is gradually becoming the mainstream sentiment.

OPEC+ Demands Stricter Compliance. The joint ministerial monitoring committee of OPEC+ has stressed the need for full compliance with respective members' production quotas, just as Kazakhstan's output came in at 1.65 million b/d last month or 12% above its 2025 quota, despite seasonal field maintenance.

Warren Buffett Doubles Down on Oxy. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) has agreed to buy Occidental’s (NYSE:OXY) petrochemical business OxyChem for $9.7 billion in cash, helping the oil and gas major to pay down debt to 15 billion in the wake of its $10.8 billion acquisition of CrownRock.

Oil Majors Say Yes to Mozambique. Italian oil major ENI (BIT:ENI) has at last taken an FID on its Coral North floating LNG project off the coast of Mozambique alongside partners CNPC, Kogas, ENH and XRG, seeking to add 3.6 mtpa liquefaction capacity to the embattled country with first gas expected in 2028.

UK Mulls Full Ban on Fracking. The British government plans to pass a bill that bans hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking), simultaneously bringing forward a law that aims to end new onshore oil and gas drilling for good, just as the opposition Reform UK party pledged to boost domestic oil extraction.

Angola’s NOC Declares Itself Ready for IPO. Sonangol, Angola's national oil company, stated that it is close to finalizing its public listing in a bid to encourage new investment in Angola, just as the African country's production continues to linger around 1 million b/d despite its 2024 exit from OPEC.

Algeria Commits to Massive Licensing Bids. Algeria's upstream regulator Alnaft said that the country will launch its next licensing round for new oil and gas blocks in March-April 2026, offering 6 to 10 exploration licenses, with three additional auctioning rounds expected to be held by 2028.

Canada's LNG Outlook Improves with New Launch. Following several months of technical issues that capped the output LNG Canada's 1st liquefaction train at 50% capacity, UK-based energy major Shell (LON:SHEL) started preparing the second 6.5 mtpa liquefaction train for final commissioning this month.

Shale Bosses Predict US Shale Peak. Kaes van’t Hof, the chief executive of US shale driller Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), said that output growth in the country will stall if prices stay near $60 per barrel as current prices are equivalent to $45 per barrel from 6-7 years ago on an inflation-adjusted basis.

Russia Loads Record Amounts of Oil. With refinery runs heavily constrained by Ukraine’s barrage of drone strikes, Russia’s crude oil exports have jumped by 25% month-over-month in September, loading 2.5 million b/d in its three Western ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk.

Greenpeace Forces LNG Carriers to Divert from Belgium. Ongoing protests by Greenpeace activists at Belgium's key Zeebrugge import terminal have forced at least three LNG carriers to divert away to other destinations, with terminal operator Fluxys expecting disruptions to last until Sunday.

California's Refineries Are Struggling. A giant blast has rocked Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) 295,000 b/d El Segundo refinery in Los Angeles, with flames engulfing its Isomax 7 jet fuel production unit, just as the adjacent Wilmington refinery operated by Phillips 66 is set for a final shutdown by mid-October.

BP Needs a Partner to Launch Its Boomerang. UK oil major BP (NYSE:BP) is reportedly seeking for a strategic partner to help develop its multi-billion-barrel Bumerangue discovery offshore Brazil, however Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) keeps is reservations as the field’s CO2 content exceeds industry standards.

Tin Soars Further as Indonesia Fights Illegal Mining. The LME three-month tin contract jumped over $37,500 per metric tonne this week after Indonesia clamped down on illegal mining across the country, confiscating 42,000 tonnes of tin sands and vowing to close 1,000 illegal mines over the next months.

Kalshi's Volume Has Been 90% Sports During Football Season,"Earlier this week, Kalshi began offering customizable parlays on its prediction market exchange for the first time ahead of Monday Night Football. Launching a new wager type on NFL games made sense, given how important sports have become to the company.

The custom parlays saw only $255,757 in trading volume, the go-to prediction market activity metric. Still, the new parlays sent shock waves throughout the sports betting industry, with DraftKings and FanDuel parent Flutter stocks plummeting the following day.

During the four weeks between Sept. 1 and Sept. 28—encompassing the first month of the NFL season—there was $1.13 billion in trading volume on Kalshi’s NFL contracts, accounting for roughly 42% of volume during that span. College football wasn’t far behind at $811 million (30%). Sports overall accounted for around 90% of trading volume.

This followed a trend in place for months on a platform that only started posting sports bets in January, having previously only done wagers on topics such as election results and weather patterns. Sports reached 91% of volume during the first two weeks of March Madness earlier this year. Even during the period between the college basketball finals in April and the beginning of the NFL season in early September, roughly 75% of volume was on sports events.

CEO Tarek Mansour recently wrote on LinkedIn that “last year I didn’t know how many points a touchdown was worth.” He has reason to tune in now.

NFL, the biggest draw for U.S. sports betting activity, has taken overall volume much higher. Prior to Aug. 25, the most volume Kalshi had done in a single week was $231 million in June during the NBA playoffs; the past five weeks have each set records. In the week from Sept. 22 to Sept. 28, overall volume hit $855 million, while NFL volume alone was $355 million.

“The sports side has grown … I’m still shocked. Every week, we do a forecast and we beat it,” Mansour told Bloomberg‘s Odd Lots podcast in an episode released this week. “America likes NFL. I mean, they like football—more than expected, I guess.”

In total, Kalshi’s volume on sports over the past four weeks reached $2.4 billion. It must be noted that volume, which includes trades involving institutional market makers and over-counts each individual’s risk, is not interchangeable with traditional sportsbook handle. But for a very rough sense of the scale of Kalshi’s numbers, consider that the record sports betting handle for a single month across all U.S. online and in-person sportsbooks is approximately $16 billion.

Kalshi’s sports volume from Sept. 1 to Sept. 28 was up 296% over the previous four-week period. The same rate of increase has not been replicated by Kalshi’s non-sports offerings, the most popular of which include wagers on cryptocurrency prices and events regarding the U.S. government. The $276 million in non-sports volume over the past month was only 39% higher than the analogous time frame in August, even though September’s total was boosted by a spike due to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate announcement on Sept. 17.

Despite offering moneyline, spread and recently parlay odds on NFL games, Kalshi continues to claim that it is not a sports gambling service. It is currently regulated as a financial exchange by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), rather than as a gaming entity by individual states.

“I just don’t really know what this has to do with gambling,” Mansour told Axios earlier this year. “If we are gambling, then I think you’re basically calling the entire financial market gambling.”

Many states and tribal groups disagree with that take and are duking it out with Kalshi in courts from coast to coast to try to restrict where the company can operate without a gaming license.

As for how the Kalshi’s sports offerings relate to its legal status, “there is no material difference between sporting events and the other categories on our platform,” a Kalshi spokesperson wrote in an email to Sportico. “Everything you can trade on Kalshi is an event that happens in the world.”

Regardless, Kalshi is, at this point, undoubtedly entangled with the business of sports. The rest of the platform’s markets have dimmed in importance.

Look no further than the wagers presented on the daily high temperatures of cities across the country. In February, Kalshi did $16 million in volume on these markets. In the longer month of September, that number was only $12 million, despite overall trading volume being up more than tenfold.

Still, Mansour told Bloomberg other topics could eventually rival sports outside of election periods, but as of right now that development looks like a longshot bet.",Sportico.com,2025-10-03T16:06:27Z,https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2025/kalshi-nfl-football-trade-bet-volume-1234872696/,-0.05098039215686279,2025-10-04 00:10:26.506736,0.9999999999999999,"['90', 'volume', 'kalshi’s', 'football', 'season', 'kalshi', 'nfl', 'sept', 'million', 'week', 'trading', 'market', 'weeks', 'month', 'mansour', 'gambling', 'earlier', 'parlays', 'betting', '28', 'billion', 'wagers', 'events', 's', 'past', 'told', 'offering', 'prediction', 'exchange', 'games', 'sense', 'company', 'activity', 'roughly', 'college']"

Promises made must be honoured | Borneo Post Online,"SEVERAL days ago, a former speaker of the Dewan Rakyat Tan Sri Azhar Azizan Harun had thrown a stone (I’d call it a rock!) at a hornet’s nest called Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63); generating a strong hive of activities that had threatened to ‘sting’ him with robust rebuttals and ardent arguments from Sarawak.

From the Head of State to a former speaker of the State Legislative Assembly (DUN), to political heads and other influential authorities, they all have a common response – you may have your own personal opinion on the issue, but promises that were expressly made, written, implied or historically significant must be duly honoured and fulfilled; not just simply brushed aside by your own personal agendas.

Azhar, in his ‘understanding of the issue’, had proclaimed that: “There is nothing in the documents I have reviewed, which included the Federal Constitution, Malaysia Act 1963, and the MA63 as well as the report by the Inter-Governmental Committee (IGC), specifying that Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore are to occupy 35 per cent of the seats in the lower House.”

Last year, Sarawak Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg was reported as saying that Sarawak and Sabah should hold 35 per cent of the parliamentary seats to safeguard against any attempts to cancel MA63 and the rights it promised.

An academic, Prof James Chin of the University of Tasmania, who is a renowned authority on Asian studies and a published historian, had said that the MA63 enshrined specific safeguards to ensure that Sabah and Sarawak would retain significant autonomy and influence, of which one critical aspect was the allocation of 34 per cent of the seats in the Dewan Rakyat.

This was to guarantee a veto vote of constitutional amendments proposed by the Malayan states should any one or both of the Borneo states object.

Chin said that when Singapore left the Malaysian Federation in 1965, the right thing to do was to redistribute its parliamentary seats to Sabah and Sarawak to maintain the status quo.

That was not done, and following subsequent redelineation exercises, the two Borneo states were now left with only 25 per cent of all parliamentary seats.

On Sept 26 this year, speaking at a ‘Statesman Speech’ forum on MA63 held at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (Unimas), Yang Di-Pertua Negeri Sarawak Tun Pehin Sri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar had said: “We will have to continue to fight until we get everything promised to us!”

He said Sarawak must persist in pressing the federal government until all rights under MA63 had been fully restored, particularly on matters originally enshrined in the Federal Constitution, but later amended without Sarawak’s consent.

Wan Junaidi cited three examples of this: powers over the environment and tourism, which once belonged to Sarawak but were reclaimed by the federal government through constitutional amendments; another was on judicial appointments recalling that before 1985 the Head of State had the power to appoint judicial commissioners in Sarawak and Sabah on the advice of the premier or chief minister.

This has since been overridden.

Dato Sri Robert Jacob Ridu, a former speaker of DUN Sarawak had this to say in his statement to the press on Thursday: “It must also be remembered that MA63 was not just a domestic matter. It was an international treaty, registered with the United Nations (UN).

“Under international law, such treaties are interpreted in light of their object and purpose.

“And what was the purpose?

“To create a federation of equals. To respect the autonomy of Sabah and Sarawak. To safeguard their interests, not to whittle them down as the years passed.

“To argue that ‘it isn’t written in the Constitution, therefore it doesn’t exist’ is to miss the entire point of treaty interpretation. International undertakings are not reduced to narrow textualism.

“They are understood in light of the promises and rationale that gave them force.”

Sarawak politicians across the racial and political divide also had their say about Harun’s statement.

State minister Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah from PBB had this to say: “This arrangement was intended to ensure that Malaya could not unilaterally amend the Federal Constitution to the detriment of the other regions.

“If they have more than two-thirds, they can just bulldoze away rights such as immigration, our control over the sea, rivers and resources.”

Assemblyman Wilfred Yap from SUPP echoed: “To argue that there is no entitlement because the words ’35 per cent’ are not explicitly written into the Constitution, is to play with semantics.

“History and context show that this safeguard was central to MA63, which was an international treaty deposited at the UN.

“This dismissal is even more troubling given how Sabah’s 40 per cent revenue entitlement, explicitly stated in the Constitution, has already been ignored for decades.

“If rights written in black-and-white can be ignored, how much easier is it to deny those embedded in structural safeguards like representation?”

In a feature article written by Emeritus Professor Datuk Dr Shad Saleem Faruqi, published in the New Straits Times of Sept 16, 2021, entitled ‘Restore Sabah, Sarawak rights’, I would like to quote the following passages: “While the late Tunku Abdul Rahman is commonly regarded as the leading architect of Malaysia, this remarkable union would not have been possible without the tireless negotiations between, and the warm cooperation of, key Sarawakian and Sabahan leaders of the time: Tun Fuad Stephens and Tun Mustapha Harun of Sabah, and Tun Temenggong Jugah, Datuk Amar Stephen Kalong Ningkan and Tan Sri Ong Kee Hui of Sarawak.

“…This special, asymmetrical arrangement was justified because of Sabah and Sarawak’s cultural and religious distinctiveness, their huge territories (60 per cent of Malaysia’s land mass), their rich natural resources in petroleum, natural gas and timber, and yet, their acute problems of poverty and underdevelopment.

“Sabah and Sarawak were given wider legislative powers than peninsular states. The federal power to have uniform laws on land, agriculture, forestry and local government is not applicable to Sabah and Sarawak.

“Amending the Constitution to affect the rights of Sabah and Sarawak requires the consent of their governors.

“All these special provisions formed the foundation of a hopeful beginning for the new Federation.

“Regrettably, not everything has worked out well. Sabah and Sarawak have suffered loss of some of their special, 1963 rights.”

The writer concluded with serious caution, and even though it has been four years since his piece had appeared on print, not much progress has been made: “The list of demands and disagreements is long and painful, and there is a growing movement for secession.

“However, there is no cause for pessimism. Tensions are inherent in any federal set-up.

“What is necessary on both sides of the South China Sea is to return to the letter and spirit of the Federal Constitution of 1963; to honour and renew our commitments to safeguard the rights accorded to Sabah and Sarawak.”

Pundits and opinions expressed by the likes of Azhar Harun would not help to lessen the politicking, which seeks a narrative favouring the federalist’s mentality of a past colonial mindset.

It is essential that we are able to not just aim for a united and harmonious Malaysia, after 62 years, but also to be treated and behave like true equals under a Malaysian sun, be it in Kuantan, Kuching or Kota Kinabalu.

I fear that for many Sarawakians these days, the wise words of the late Tun Jugah still rings painfully true in their ears: “Malaysia should not be like the sugar cane – sweet at the head, but tasteless towards the end.”

May Almighty God continue to shower his blessings on us all, Sarawakians, Sabahans and Malayans – together as Malaysians.",Borneo Post Online,2025-10-03T13:52:23Z,https://www.theborneopost.com/2025/10/04/promises-made-must-be-honoured/,0.3647058823529412,2025-10-04 00:10:31.290292,0.9999999999999999,"['promises', 'honoured', 'sarawak', 'sabah', 'ma63', 'federal', 'constitution', 'rights', 'cent', 'malaysia', 'tun', 'sri', 'written', 'seats', '1963', 'state', 'safeguard', 'states', 'international', 'speaker', 'tan', 'azhar', 'harun', 'head', '35', 'datuk', 'parliamentary', 'federation', 'treaty', 'special', 'days', 'dewan', 'rakyat', 'legislative', 'dun']"
"Put your money in CBN licensed banks, NDIC tells Nigerians - Blueprint Newspapers Limited","The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), has warned Nigerians to always ensure they bank with Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) licenced banks.

Speaking during the Corporation’s special day at the 20th Edition of the Abuja International Trade Fair organised by the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), Thursday, NDIC’s Managing Director, Sunday Thompson, also urged them to be vigilant against ponzi schemes.

The NDIC MD, who was represented by represented by Mrs Bimpe Akande, the Director, Performance Management Department of NDIC, reassured Nigerians that their funds in CBN licenced banks were safe as they were covered by deposit insurance provided by the Corporation.

According to him, this vigilance is crucial to protecting your hard-earned savings.

”For over three decades, the NDIC has played a vital role in safeguarding depositors funds, particularly the most vulnerable, and fortifying the financial system.

”Our primary objectives include insuring deposits in licenced banks, supervising financial institutions, managing distressed banks, and ensuring a smooth resolution process in the event of bank failures.

”We are dedicated to protecting Nigerian bank, in collaboration with the CBN, we strive to maintain stability in the banking sector, enforce compliance with banking regulations, and exercise effective oversight over insured deposit-taking institutions.

”Our mission, embodied in the tagline ‘Protecting your bank deposits,’ is to promote financial inclusion and ability by reassuring Nigerians of the security of their savings,” he said.

Part of efforts by the Corporation to protect depositors’ funds, the NDIC boss said, was to the increase in the maximum deposit insurance coverage, which had broadened protection across various licenced banks.

“Currently, the NDIC insures depositors of Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), Mobile Money Operators and Non-Interest Banks, up to a coverage limit of five million naira. Depositors of Payment Service Banks (PSBs) Microfinance Banks (MFBs) and Primary Mortgage Banks (PMBs) are insured up to two million naira. This enhanced coverage ensures that approximately 98.98% of total depositors in Deposit Money Banks, 99.27% in Microfinance Banks, 99.34% in Primary Mortgage Banks, and 99.99% in Payment Service Banks are protected, reflecting NDIC’s unwavering commitment to fulfilling its mandate.

“In the event that a bank fails, depositors with account balances exceeding the insured coverage limit receive an initial payment up to the maximum insured amount. Their remaining balances are then paid through liquidation dividends. Liquidation dividends refer to payouts made to depositors and creditors from the proceeds generated from the sale of a failed bank’s assets and recovered debts during the liquidation process. These dividends are usually paid on a pro-rata basis, meaning depositors receive a proportionate share of the recovered funds relative to their outstanding balances beyond the insured limit,” Sunday added.

In his remarks, the President Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), Emeka Obegolu, noted that the NDIC’s role in Nigeria’s financial landscape space has helped to stabilise the country’s system.

According to Obegolu, who was represented by ACCI Director-General, ACCI, said the Chief Agabaidu Jideani, “We particularly commend NDIC’s initiatives in advancing financial inclusion, especially through its digital innovations and strong consumer protection framework.

By extending deposit insurance coverage beyond deposit money banks to include microfinance banks, mortgage banks, non-interest banks, payment service banks, and mobile money operators, NDIC has shown responsiveness to the evolving dynamics of Nigeria’s financial landscape. These interventions not only protect depositors but also create a more enabling environment for SMEs and entrepreneurs to participate confidently in the economy.

For us at the ACCI, the NDIC is more than a regulator; it is a strategic partner in advocacy and economic development. By working together, we can build stronger linkages between financial safety, enterprise growth, and national development. This synergy is vital in advancing Nigeria’s competitiveness, reducing business risks, and ensuring that our financial system supports innovation, job creation, and sustainable investment.",Blueprint Newspapers Limited,2025-10-03T16:05:37Z,https://blueprint.ng/put-your-money-in-cbn-licensed-banks-ndic-tells-nigerians/,0.3176470588235294,2025-10-04 00:10:34.488521,0.9999999999999999,"['licensed', 'tells', 'banks', 'ndic', 'money', 'nigerians', 'cbn', 'depositors', 'deposit', 'bank', 'acci', 'insured', 'coverage', 'insurance', 'licenced', 'ndic’s', 'funds', 'payment', '99', 'corporation', 'abuja', 'represented', 'protecting', 'system', 'primary', 'limit', 'service', 'microfinance', 'mortgage', 'balances', 'liquidation', 'dividends', 'nigeria’s', 'nigeria', 'chamber']"
LCCI Advocates Sustainable Transformation Of Nigeria's Tourism Industry - InfoStride News,"The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has urged government and private stakeholders to prioritize the sustainable transformation of Nigeria’s tourism sector, stressing its potential as a major driver of economic diversification and job creation. The call comes as policymakers intensify discussions on reducing overdependence on crude oil revenues by expanding opportunities in sectors such as tourism, hospitality, and the creative industries.

Speaking at a recent forum on the state of Nigeria’s non-oil economy, LCCI President, Gabriel Idahosa, emphasized that tourism, if properly harnessed, could contribute significantly to GDP growth while generating millions of jobs across different segments of the value chain. He noted that Nigeria’s vast cultural heritage, natural attractions, and vibrant creative scene remain underutilized due to infrastructural gaps, insecurity, and weak policy frameworks.

Idahosa explained that the chamber’s position is anchored on the belief that tourism is both a social and economic asset. He called for coordinated investments in critical infrastructure such as airports, roads, rail networks, and hospitality facilities to improve accessibility and the overall visitor experience. He also stressed the need for greater public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance tourism projects and promote Nigeria as a global destination.

According to LCCI, sustainable transformation means not only building physical infrastructure but also investing in skills development, environmental conservation, and community-based initiatives that empower locals. “Tourism should be designed in a way that communities benefit directly, cultural assets are preserved, and the environment is protected for future generations,” Idahosa stated.

The chamber also pointed out that tourism could play a pivotal role in foreign exchange earnings if Nigeria positions itself to attract international visitors. Countries like Kenya, South Africa, and Morocco were cited as examples where tourism contributes substantially to national revenue. Idahosa argued that with Nigeria’s large diaspora, cultural festivals, historical landmarks, and natural reserves, the country has the potential to become a hub for both regional and international tourism.

Industry stakeholders at the forum echoed these sentiments, adding that insecurity remains the biggest obstacle to Nigeria’s tourism growth. Several experts noted that no amount of marketing or investment would attract tourists if safety concerns persist. They urged the government to prioritize security in tourism development zones, while also improving visa processes to make Nigeria more accessible to foreigners.

The LCCI further recommended that government streamline regulatory processes, reduce taxation burdens on operators, and establish tourism-friendly policies that encourage investments. It also advocated for digital promotion of Nigeria’s tourism products, leveraging platforms like social media, virtual tours, and e-ticketing systems to reach global audiences.

Meanwhile, local operators welcomed the chamber’s push, noting that many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in hospitality, entertainment, and transport depend on tourism. A hotel manager in Lagos said that a sustainable approach could unlock opportunities for thousands of entrepreneurs who currently struggle with high costs and poor infrastructure.

Cultural experts also supported the call, stressing the importance of preserving Nigeria’s heritage. They argued that promoting cultural tourism through festivals, art exhibitions, museums, and traditional crafts could help showcase Nigeria’s diversity while creating income streams for local artisans.

Analysts believe that if implemented, LCCI’s recommendations could place tourism among Nigeria’s top non-oil revenue earners within the next decade. They argue that the current global shift toward sustainable tourism — which emphasizes environmental protection, inclusivity, and cultural preservation — provides Nigeria with a unique opportunity to reposition its industry.

In conclusion, the LCCI maintained that the sustainable transformation of Nigeria’s tourism sector requires urgent collaboration between government, private investors, and local communities. It said the gains would not only be economic but also social, fostering cultural pride and unity. For Nigeria, where unemployment and economic pressures remain high, tourism could emerge as a game changer — but only if the right policies and investments are put in place without delay.",The InfoStride,2025-10-03T16:00:17Z,https://www.theinfostride.com/lcci-advocates-sustainable-transformation-of-nigerias-tourism-industry/,0.2941176470588236,2025-10-04 00:10:46.978830,0.9999999999999999,"['advocates', 'tourism', 'nigeria’s', 'lcci', 'sustainable', 'industry', 'transformation', 'cultural', 'nigeria', 'economic', 'idahosa', 'hospitality', 'social', 'investments', 'infrastructure', 'global', 'local', 'lagos', 'chamber', 'urged', 'private', 'stakeholders', 'prioritize', 'sector', 'stressing', 'potential', 'opportunities', 'creative', 'forum', 'non-oil', 'growth', 'noted', 'heritage', 'natural', 'remain']"
Trump's approval rating plunges with low income voters,"President Trump is facing growing signs of political trouble, as his approval rating has dropped sharply among low-income Americans.

In August, President Trump’s approval within this cohort stood at 55 percent approve / 41 percent disapprove, but by September, it had collapsed to 31 percent approve / 61 percent disapprove, according to ActiVote polling. That’s a 44-point drop in net approval among low-income voters in just one month.

Why It Matters

Low-income voters were a cornerstone of Trump’s winning coalition in 2016 and again in 2024, helping him flip key battleground states with strong support from working-class communities. A 44-point swing in net approval in just one month signals deep political vulnerability: not only does it suggest disillusionment with his economic agenda, but it also raises questions about whether his base of working-class support may be fracturing. If these voters begin to shift away, it could weaken the Republican Party's standing in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin—where blue-collar turnout has often been decisive in close elections.

What To Know

Low-income voters appear to be shifting sharply away from President Trump, largely driven by economic pressures and rising uncertainty. In the latest YouGov/Economist poll, 43 percent of the lowest-income Americans reported that they are financially worse off than a year ago, while only 23 percent said they expect to be better off in a year. Meanwhile, 52 percent of low-income voters said they would be personally affected by the government shutdown, and among them, 31 percent blamed Republicans for the shutdown, 24 percent blamed Democrats, and 34 percent said both parties share blame.

Trump’s approval among low-income voters over the broader economy also shows deterioration: in August, 36 percent approved and 53 percent disapproved — a –17 net rating. By September, those numbers slid further to 32 percent approve / 54 percent disapprove, for a –22 net rating. Inflation numbers tell a parallel story: in August, 31 percent approved and 62 percent disapproved (–31 net), but by September the net disapproval widened to –36.

It comes as the broader U.S. economy is showing signs of strain. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the economy rebounded at a 3.8 percent annualized rate in the second quarter of 2025 after contracting earlier in the year. However, forecasts from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia suggest full-year growth will be much weaker, around 1.7 percent. The labor market, once a point of strength, is softening: private employers cut 32,000 jobs in September, unemployment has climbed to 4.3 percent, and job openings remain stagnant.

Meanwhile, the government shutdown is taking a toll: analysts estimate the shutoff could shave billions off GDP each week and lead to layoffs and furloughs, especially among federal workers. With roughly 803,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay, the shutdown puts low-income households particularly at risk.

And the polling reflects this. The YouGov/Economist survey showed that 52 percent of low-income voters said they would be personally affected, underscoring the vulnerability of this group to furloughs, missed paychecks, and cuts to government services. When asked who is to blame, 31 percent pointed to Republicans, 24 percent blamed Democrats, and 34 percent said both parties share responsibility.

What People Are Saying

Nate Silver, statistician and founder of Silver Bulletin, said in a blog post: ""This has been a bad week for Trump when it comes to the polls.""

G Elliott Morris, pollster and former head of FiveThirtyEight, said on X: ""Trump is very unpopular -- particularly if you look at his ""strongly disapprove"" percentage. a lot of people just have not come to grips with what it means to have 48% of the public saying they hate the president.""

"Australia has fined its country's largest telecom company for $12 million, here's why - The Times of India","Australia's Federal Court has fined Telstra A$18 million for secretly downgrading internet speeds for nearly 9,000 Belong customers in late 2020, halving their maximum upload speeds without notification. The ACCC stated this denied customers the opportunity to assess their service suitability. Telstra has accepted the findings and is compensating affected users.

Australia's largest telecommunications company, Telstra, has been hit with an A$18 million (US$11.87 million) fine by the Federal Court for downgrading the internet speed plans of nearly 9,000 customers without notice. The penalty was announced on Friday (October 3) by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country's competition watchdog. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the ACCC found that Telstra migrated 8,897 customers of its low-cost brand, Belong, to a slower service plan during October and November 2020. Moreover, the company is said to have failed to inform these customers that their maximum upload speed had been halved. “Telstra's failure to inform customers that their broadband service had been changed denied them the opportunity to decide whether the changed service was suitable for their needs,” ACCC Commissioner Anna Brakey was quoted as saying.

What Telstra has to say on fine

The ACCC also noted that Telstra has either already compensated or committed to compensating all affected customers. Remediation includes a credit or payment of A$15 for each month they were on the lower upload speed plan. A company spokesperson told Reuters via email that Telstra has accepted the court's findings and is in the process of completing remediation for the final group of affected customers. This fine comes as Australian telecom firms face intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly following rival Optus’s two separate emergency call outages last month, one of which was linked to four deaths.

Kazakhstan announces plans for second NPP - Nuclear Engineering International,"The head of Kazakhstan’s Atomic Energy Agency, Almassadam Satkaliyev, has announced plans to build a second NPP in the southeastern Almaty region of Kazakhstan, where the construction of its first NPP began earlier this year.

“A meeting of the State Commission for the Development of the Nuclear Industry was held, which identified a second promising site for the construction of a NPP in Kazakhstan,” Satkaliyev said. “All authorised government agencies have been involved. The opinion of the national grid operator is certainly being taken into account, as well as the opinion of the Ministry of Energy, and, as I already mentioned, the projected balance sheet.”

He added that the next site for NPP construction had been identified as the Zhambyl district of the Almaty region. “That is, our second station will also be in the south of the country, because the south is experiencing shortages, as you know. Currently, electricity is being transmitted via the North-South transit line. This will ensure reliability and stability of the energy supply,” Satkaliyev said following the State Commission meeting in the lower house of parliament.

He confirmed that the Atomic Energy Agency is in negotiations with all participants in the process, including all bidders. “That is, China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has not made a final decision on selecting the People’s Republic of China, but we have, as always, stated that we view CNNC as the priority contractor for the construction of the nuclear power plant, based on the proposals they made during their participation in the construction of the NPP. All issues related to the contractor’s performance, technical solutions, and the attitude of Kazakhstani citizens toward a particular vendor will be fully taken into account when making decisions.”

He also commented on the possibility of building another nuclear power plant in Kurchatov in the north-east Abai Region. Kurchatov, was once the centre of operations for the adjoining Semipalatinsk former Soviet Test Site. With the cessation of nuclear testing and the decommissioning of the test site, Kurchatov’s population fell dramatically. The nuclear facilities at Kurchatov are managed by the Kazakhstan Institute of Atomic Energy, a division of the National Nuclear Centre.

“The construction of a nuclear power facility will be considered – either as an addition to the current facilities or as a base station,” said Satkaliyev. “It could, as I’ve already mentioned, be a small- or medium-capacity station to meet the needs of the Science City, for scientific purposes, including providing electricity to the region.” He added: “This is the basic approach” currently outlined in the plans. And we plan to implement it in precisely this sequence.”",Nuclear Engineering International,2025-10-03T16:06:15Z,https://www.neimagazine.com/news/kazakhstan-announces-plans-for-second-npp/,0.1843137254901961,2025-10-04 00:10:50.901273,0.9999999999999999,"['announces', 'npp', 'kazakhstan', 'plans', 'nuclear', 'construction', 'energy', 'satkaliyev', 'region', 'site', 'atomic', 'national', 'station', 'power', 'kurchatov', 'agency', 'almaty', 'meeting', 'state', 'commission', 'identified', 'opinion', 'account', 'mentioned', 'added', 'south', 'electricity', 'including', 'china', 'cnnc', 'plant', 'centre', 'test', 'facilities', 'head']"

Why Businesses Still Invest in Billboard Advertising,"Share

Email

Even in an age where digital marketing dominates conversations, businesses continue to invest heavily in billboard advertising.

Billboards remain one of the most visible ways to reach large audiences, offering consistent exposure in high-traffic areas. Their impact is reinforced by decades of use in brand-building and consumer engagement.

A billboard advertising agency helps companies maximize this traditional medium by combining strategic placement with modern data tools. While digital ads can be skipped or blocked, billboards remain present in daily life, making them an essential part of the marketing mix. Understanding why businesses still value this channel reveals its continued relevance.

Broad Reach and Visibility

Billboards are designed to capture attention in places where people naturally gather or commute.

Positioned along highways, city streets, and transit routes, they provide a constant stream of visibility to thousands of individuals each day. Unlike many digital ads that can be easily ignored or avoided, billboards are difficult to overlook in a physical environment.

This consistent presence allows businesses to repeatedly deliver brand messages to the same audiences over time. Whether it’s drivers stuck in traffic or pedestrians walking past a busy intersection, billboards ensure high-frequency exposure. This broad reach is one of the most enduring reasons companies continue allocating budget for outdoor advertising.

Complement to Digital Campaigns

While digital platforms are crucial for reaching audiences online, billboards are a powerful complement to these efforts.

When consumers encounter the same message both on a screen and in their physical surroundings, brand recognition strengthens. This repetition across different channels makes campaigns more memorable.

Businesses also benefit from the trust and permanence associated with billboard advertising. Online ads can feel temporary or fleeting, but a physical billboard reinforces legitimacy. By combining the immediacy of digital with the stability of outdoor media, companies create integrated campaigns that connect more effectively with audiences.

Geographic Targeting and Local Impact

Billboards provide special opportunities for geographic targeting that digital ads cannot fully replicate. A well-placed billboard can influence people in a specific city, neighborhood, or even a single highway corridor. Local businesses often rely on this form of advertising to attract nearby customers who are already close to their stores or services.

National brands also leverage billboards to create regional relevance. For example, a campaign may feature slightly different messages depending on the city to better connect with local culture. This ability to target specific markets while maintaining broad exposure is another reason billboards remain a core marketing tool.

Cost-Effectiveness and Longevity

Cost is a significant consideration in advertising, and billboards often deliver great value for the investment.

When measured in cost per thousand impressions, billboards are competitive with many digital platforms while offering advantages such as uninterrupted exposure. A single placement can generate millions of impressions over a month.

Another benefit is longevity. Unlike digital ads, which require ongoing bidding or risk disappearing once budgets run out, billboards remain in place 24 hours a day. This constant visibility ensures that campaigns maintain momentum without additional daily spending, making billboards a reliable choice for businesses seeking long-term exposure.

Strong Brand Awareness and Credibility

Billboards are highly effective at building brand awareness, particularly when companies want to establish a strong presence in crowded markets. Large, high-visibility displays communicate scale and professionalism, signaling to consumers that the brand has staying power. This perception of credibility often influences how audiences view the business.

Repetition also plays an important role. Seeing the same billboard multiple times during a commute reinforces brand recall.

Over time, this exposure helps businesses move from being unknown to being a recognized and trusted part of the local market. Even without immediate action, the familiarity generated by billboards increases the likelihood of future engagement.

Adaptability to Modern Marketing

Billboard advertising has evolved alongside digital innovation. Traditional static billboards remain common, but digital billboards have opened new possibilities. These displays allow businesses to rotate multiple messages, update promotions in real time, or align campaigns with events and weather conditions.

Interactive features such as QR codes or short URLs also connect physical billboards with online platforms. This adaptability guarantees that billboards continue to play a role in modern marketing strategies, bridging the gap between offline visibility and online engagement. For businesses seeking flexibility, billboards are no longer limited to one static message.

Why Billboards Still Matter in a Digital World

Despite the rise of online marketing channels, businesses continue to invest in billboards because they deliver reach, visibility, and impact that digital platforms alone cannot provide. They complement online efforts, target audiences geographically, and remain cost-effective over time. They also strengthen brand awareness and credibility while evolving to integrate with digital campaigns.

Far from outdated, billboards remain a proven and adaptable part of modern marketing strategies.",TechBullion,2025-10-03T16:05:43Z,https://techbullion.com/why-businesses-still-invest-in-billboard-advertising/,0.04313725490196085,2025-10-04 00:10:55.925907,0.9999999999999999,"['businesses', 'billboard', 'advertising', 'invest', 'billboards', 'digital', 'marketing', 'remain', 'brand', 'audiences', 'exposure', 'campaigns', 'online', 'ads', 'visibility', 'share', 'continue', 'reach', 'companies', 'modern', 'physical', 'platforms', 'local', 'impact', 'engagement', 'broad', 'city', 'provide', 'deliver', 'messages', 'complement', 'connect', 'awareness', 'credibility', 'large']"
NASENI solar products and the imperative of closing Nigeria's energy gap - Blueprint Newspapers Limited,"In over 30 years of its existence, the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) has championed technology as the foundation of national growth. Specifically in response to Nigeria’s critical energy matters, the Agency today is leading the charge with technology and innovative solar solutions—advancing access to clean, affordable power while driving economic, agricultural, and industrial transformations.

It is noteworthy to affirm that initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty and enhancing security across Nigeria occupy premium position in the heart of the Khalil Suleiman Halilu’s led Management of NASENI, being the foremost technology development institution of Federal Government, established under direct supervision of any sitting President of the country.

Today, as Nigeria grapples with the challenge of ensuring steady and reliable electricity supply as precursor to genuine industrialization, NASENI has continued to roll out various innovative solutions to support attempts to come out of the woods.

Moreso, the matter is treated always as an urgent issue critical to the country’s industrial development by the management of the Agency.

Overtime, under its Alternative Power Solutions for Industrial Development Programme (APSIDP), NASENI is playing a crucial role in tackling Nigeria’s current energy deficit by championing development and deployment of various solar energy solutions. Through focusing on local manufacturing and innovative applications, NASENI is not only providing sustainable and affordable alternatives, but also contributing to broader national goals like food security and economic growth.

As of March 4, 2025, available statistics showed that the highest electricity power made available for distribution across our country was in the region of 5.801.84 mw. This significantly is a far cry from 40,000 mw need either to meet or sustain both the basic household and industrial electricity requirements for Nigeria.

NASENI has continued to dedicate itself to rigorous research and development (R&D) and commercialization efforts, coming up with SMART power-generating innovative solutions that are already making considerable impacts on the energy market. Its pioneering products are a culmination of decades of collaborative efforts between NASENI, its 12 divisions spread across the country and other private sector partners.

Since 2011, the Agency established the NASENI Solar Energy Limited (NSEL) located in Karshi, FCT, Abuja, producing different sizes of high quality solar photovoltaic panels.

Amongst other impressive offers, aside from solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, are NASENI 1KVA Hybrid Solar Generator, a range of energy products known as BOSGEN; the NASENI E-Tricycle designed for passenger and cargo use, the innovative NASENI 5W bulbs, the efficient NASENI Solar Irrigation Pumps, and the versatile NASENI IP66 200W Solar Light.

NASENI’s NSEL is the first company in West Africa to produce solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and has since gone through extensive research to design and produce solar modules in various categories and sizes. The factory recently was upgraded to 50 megawatts capacity (with plans to expand to 100 megawatts) and also equipped with the requisite machineries, man-power and technical-know-how, producing high quality mono-crystalline solar panels which have comparatively out-performs many other imported ones.

Now looking ahead, the sustainability of Nigeria’s economic growth is intricately entwined with long-term availability of energy sources that are not only affordable or accessible but also environmentally sustainable. This energy mix includes solar energy where NASENI now plays lead role in the country.

NASENI solar solutions are Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) certified, with Mandatory Conformity Assessment Programme (MANCAP) certification. NSEL’s solar panels range includes 80W, 175W, 180W, 190W, 200W, 250W, 275W, 350W and 690W. The production section has the capacity to design and produce modules tailored to specific needs.

Other products from NSEL include Plug and Play Solar Home Solutions, a hybrid system with 1.5KVA electric power output rated capacity, designed and patented to generate clean electricity for homes; and Hybrid Solar Power Trainer which simulates a typical grid-tied solar PV household electrical wiring connection for trainees to have adequate knowledge.

Others are Solar-Powered Event Generator, designed and patented to provide power supply for occasions like marriage, naming ceremony or any other such social function that requires stable power supply; and NSEL Solar Control System designed to generate electricity that can power small scale electrical appliances such as lighting point, mobile phone, Laptop, etc.

NSEL’s prowess transcends solar module production. The company carries out services like load auditing, systems sizing and design, PV module installations and maintenance, renewable energy services research and consultancy. The installation experience and capacity of the company’s pool of well-trained staff is premium; their works have been felt across Nigeria’s landscape, with presence in all its geopolitical zones.

The NASENI 1KVA Hybrid Solar Generator stands out due to its ability to provide a dependable power source for both homes and businesses particularly during power outages. This advanced solar energy solution is equipped with two 250W solar panels and a 100AH battery, ensuring reliable power supply. It features sophisticated circuitries that protect against overload, overcharging, and deep discharge, as well as an MPPT-type charge controller and a digital display for real-time operation monitoring. Additionally, it comes with an external battery port that allows for scalability. The advantages of this generator are profound and diverse, tailored to function effectively in the challenging weather conditions of the Western Sub-Saharan and Central African sub-regions.

As complement to the initiative, NASENI has introduced energy-efficient products like the 5W LED bulbs. These bulbs provide exceptional illumination while consuming significantly less energy than conventional brands, delivering dual benefits of reducing electricity costs for families or businesses and being environmentally friendly.

In line with its mission to enhance energy access across Nigeria, NASENI has unveiled innovative Solar Lighting System, particularly crucial for small businesses and communities that may have limited energy requirements or lack reliable access to the national electricity grid. In addition, it features a charging port compatible with mobile phones, hair clippers, rechargeable fans, and similar devices. This versatile system offers dual charging options, whereby users can charge the system either through the solar panel or by connecting to electrical grid. Once fully charged, this power solution can provide reliable lighting for an impressive duration of 48 to 72 hours, delivering excellent illumination for various needs.

NASENI’s BOSGEN (Battery Operated Solar Generator) system functions as a vital link between renewable energy generation and dependable power distribution. The BOSGEN range encompasses a variety of renewable energy solutions with capacities which extend from 480 watts to a robust 15 kilovolt-amperes (kVA).

This wide array ensures comprehensive coverage for various use cases, catering to different energy demands.

In addition to the innovations, NASENI has introduced specialized products like the NASENI Torch Light, which directly responds to the specific needs of night farmers. These sustainable lighting solutions empower farmers to extend their working hours, thereby increasing productivity and enhancing safety during night-time agricultural operations.

Also, NASENI’s IP66-rated 200W Solar Light provides dependable illumination for outdoor spaces, designed to withstand harsh weather conditions. This feature is crucial for urban areas requiring increased security and for rural regions where access to electricity is still limited. A key component of NASENI’s strategy is its commitment to localizing the production of solar technology. The Agency is building the largest Renewable Energy Park in Gora, Nasarawa State where solar energy components and products will be produced.

In the realm of agriculture, the NASENI Solar Irrigation Pump has emerged as a ground-breaking solution. By utilizing solar energy for irrigation purposes, farmers are positioned to significantly increase crop yields as they increase farming rounds yearly because they do not have to rely on rain-fed irrigation anymore. This innovation not only promotes food security but also offers a sustainable farming approach in the face of changing climatic conditions.

Recently the NASENI Solar Irrigation Pump received endorsement for a nationwide distribution by the National Economic Council (NEC), Nigeria, a Council chaired by the country’s Vice president, Senator Kashim Shettima. The pumps are a game-changer for Nigerian farmers, who have long depended on expensive and polluting petrol-powered systems. Through providing cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable alternative, NASENI’s solar pumps are helping to boost agricultural productivity.

Farmers now can irrigate their crops consistently, enabling all year-round cultivation and increasing yields. By reducing operational costs, NASENI’s solar pumps eliminate fuel costs, thus frees up resources for farmers to invest in other areas like seeds and fertilizers and to enhance food security. The ability to farm during dry season helps stabilize food production, which can lead to more consistent harvests and lower food prices.

Beyond agriculture, NASENI’s solar initiatives are set to have a far-reaching impact on Nigeria’s economy and environment. By promoting the use of solar energy, the Agency is helping to create green jobs. The development or use of solar technology is creating employment opportunities for Nigeria’s youth.

While also unlocking carbon credits, farmers and other users of NASENI’s solar technologies can become eligible for carbon credit programmes, providing additional stream of income and promoting a cleaner environment. Shifting from fossil fuels to solar power helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, thereby aligning with Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan.

So far NASENI’s efforts have demonstrated a strategic approach to addressing Nigeria’s energy challenges by leveraging local innovation, technology transfer, and sustainable solutions. By focusing on practical applications like solar irrigation and localized solar energy products manufacturing, the Agency is helping to build a more resilient and self-sufficient energy sector not only to support the industrialization ambition of the government, but also keep the private sector striving.",Blueprint Newspapers Limited,2025-10-03T15:59:01Z,https://blueprint.ng/naseni-solar-products-and-the-imperative-of-closing-nigerias-energy-gap/,0.4274509803921569,2025-10-04 00:10:57.846989,0.9999999999999999,"['imperative', 'closing', 'gap', 'solar', 'energy', 'naseni', 'nigeria’s', 'products', 'power', 'solutions', 'naseni’s', 'electricity', 'agency', 'farmers', 'technology', 'innovative', 'nigeria', 'development', 'irrigation', 'system', 'national', 'security', 'reliable', 'sustainable', 'food', 'generator', 'designed', 'access', 'economic', 'industrial', 'country', 'supply', 'nsel', 'panels', 'pv']"
"XRP Price & ADA Rally Trends Compete, While BlockDAG Surges Ahead With a BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team Deal & Nearly $420M Raised","Share

Email

The crypto market continues to deliver new narratives that grab traders’ attention, with XRP (XRP) price analysis showing the token defending its $2.70 zone and Cardano (ADA) bullish analysis pointing to seasonal momentum that could drive ADA toward $1.50.

Both tokens remain important forces in the market, but BlockDAG (BDAG) is steering the conversation far beyond charts and technical setups. With nearly $420 million raised in its presale at $0.0015 in Batch 31, BlockDAG is now defining itself as more than just a presale project.

Building on that momentum, BlockDAG’s multi-year BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team sponsorship, complete with Alpine cars and team drivers, has catapulted the project onto the global stage positioning it as one of the strongest crypto investments in 2025.

XRP Holds Support in Crucial Price Gap

The XRP (XRP) price analysis continues to spotlight the importance of the $2.70 support zone. Analysts using Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution have identified a price gap between $2.51 and $2.73, making this range critical for Ripple’s future performance. According to Martinez, holding above $2.70 could allow XRP to rebound toward $3.20 or even retest its all-time high of $3.60.

Other analysts remain cautious, noting that a breakdown below $2.70 could send XRP back toward $2.20. Despite the risks, the XRP Army remains bullish, with popular trader Cobb declaring XRP will never fall below $2.50 again. Currently, XRP trades near $2.80, up from its recent support bounce but still down 7% weekly. Whether XRP rallies higher or slips back depends on its ability to defend key technical levels

Cardano Builds Momentum With Holder Growth

Cardano’s (ADA) bullish analysis points to a potential breakout as ADA consolidates around $0.89. The token has reached a milestone of 3.125 million holders, with wallet growth acting as a strong signal of adoption. Historically, Cardano rallies in Q4, with 2023 delivering a 140% surge and 2024 a 35% increase during the same period. Analysts believe this seasonal pattern could drive ADA toward $1.20 or even $1.50 if support holds.

Cardano is trading above its 50-week moving average at $0.756, with RSI at a neutral 52, suggesting momentum is cooling before a potential upswing. Resistance remains at $1, while losing support below $0.75 could open downside targets near $0.60.

The Cardano (ADA) bullish analysis is further strengthened by institutional adoption. Reliance Global Group recently added ADA to its treasury, highlighting corporate confidence in its long-term vision.

BlockDAG’s BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team Deal & Referrals Drive Adoption

While XRP’s (XRP) price analysis and Cardano’s (ADA) bullish analysis dominate trading discussions, BlockDAG is capturing global attention with cultural and adoption-focused moves. The project has raised nearly $420 million in presale with a limited-time price of $0.0015 in Batch 31, and a confirmed listing price of $0.05.

Its defining moment arrived at Token2049 in Singapore, where BlockDAG unveiled its multi-year partnership with the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team. The reveal featured Alpine’s race car, team drivers, at the Crypto Fast Lane VIP event at Raffles Hotel. More than just branding, the deal includes interactive fan activations, simulators, and hackathons at global events, placing BlockDAG in front of Formula 1®’s multi-billion viewer audience. This scale of visibility positions BlockDAG as a cultural force as well as a technical one.

At the adoption level, BlockDAG’s X1 mobile miner has attracted over 3 million users worldwide, earning up to 20 BDAG daily ahead of its mainnet launch. This grassroots participation anchors real demand before trading begins. Meanwhile, its referral program offers 25% rewards for referrers and 5% bonuses for referees, creating viral community-driven growth.

By combining elite sponsorships, millions of users, and a lucrative referral structure, BlockDAG is proving itself more than hype. These achievements cement its status as the best crypto investment, outpacing competitors like XRP and Cardano in both execution and visibility.

Wrapping Up

XRP’s price analysis highlights critical support levels that could trigger a rebound, while Cardano’s bullish analysis shows adoption growth and seasonal trends pointing toward a late-year rally.

However, BlockDAG is operating on a different level. With nearly $420 million raised, over 3 million X1 users, and a referral system driving rapid expansion, the project is already building momentum before launch.

Most importantly, the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team sponsorship revealed in Singapore has vaulted BlockDAG into mainstream visibility that no other presale has matched. By blending cultural reach with technological adoption, BlockDAG is not just participating in the market, it is shaping it. For investors looking for the best crypto investment in 2025, BlockDAG’s unique combination of credibility and visibility makes it the clear frontrunner.

"8th Pay Commission: AICPI-IW rises in August, what it means for DA and salary?","8th Pay Commission Update: The All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers, known as AICPI-IW, showed a small jump in August 2025. The number went up by 0.6 point and reached 147.1. In July 2025, the index stood at 146.5. The Labour Bureau, which works under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, shared this information. In its press release, it said, “The All-India CPI-IW for August, 2025 increased by 0.6 point and stood at 147.1 (one hundred forty-Seven point One).”

This rise comes after a bigger increase in July 2025, when the index grew by 1.5 points or about 1.03%. The data is watched closely because it is used to calculate dearness allowance, or DA, for central government workers. The formula to decide DA comes from the 7th Pay Commission.

8 banks that don’t penalise you for not meeting savings account minimum balance norms

All-India Group-wise CPI-IW for July, 2025 and August, 2025:

How are DA and 8th Pay Commission connected?

Dearness Allowance or DA is given to workers so their salary doesn’t lose value when things get more expensive. The government recently said it will give 3% more DA to employees, starting from July 1, 2025.

The next increase will come on January 1, 2026. That hike will depend on the AICPI numbers from July to December 2025. In July, the index went up 1.5 points and in August it went up another 0.6 points, reported Upstox. if it keeps going up like this the employees are hoping the DA increase in January 2026 will be bigger.

This upcoming DA hike has another layer of importance. Experts believe that the rate of DA that becomes active in January 2026 may also guide the 8th Central Pay Commission when it decides the new minimum salary hike factor, also called the fitment factor. If DA is higher, the fitment factor may also be a little higher, which can benefit employees once the new pay commission starts.

The 8th Pay Commission has not been yet formally set up, and its terms of reference are still awaited. One more point to remember is that whenever a new pay commission comes into effect DA is usually reset to zero.",Newsd.in,2025-10-03T16:05:35Z,https://newsd.in/8th-pay-commission-aicpi-iw-rises-in-august-what-it-means-for-da-and-salary/,0.1843137254901961,2025-10-04 00:11:06.599654,0.9999999999999999,"['rises', 'means', 'da', 'pay', 'commission', '8th', 'salary', 'aicpi-iw', '2025', 'index', 'point', 'workers', 'increase', 'points', 'employees', '2026', 'hike', 'factor', '147', 'stood', 'labour', 'all-india', 'cpi-iw', 'bigger', 'dearness', 'allowance', 'central', 'minimum', 'fitment', 'higher', 'update', 'india', 'consumer', 'price', 'industrial']"

I have been a widow for over six years. What is upsetting is how the government wants such a huge amount at tax time. This year's taxes are even worse.

Plans go ahead for €35m National Cricket Centre in Fingal | Connaught Telegraph,"Gordon Deegan

Fingal County Council has given the green light for a new €35 million National Cricket Centre that will host the 2030 T20 World Cup matches.

The Council has granted planning permission to Sport Ireland after consultants estimated it will generate a €93 million tourism dividend over five years.

A planning report drawn up by Cunnane Stratton Reynolds states that during the same 2026 to 2030 period, the cricket stadium will generate an additional €29 million through ticket sales and operational expenditure.

In July, Sport Ireland opened the tendering process for the construction of the NCC, estimating that the spend would be €35 million.

The National Cricket Centre (NCC) will include a spectator bowl with a permanent capacity of 4,240, which can be expanded to a maximum capacity of 12,000.

It will also include a High Performance Centre (HPC), and supporting infrastructure for the Sport Ireland National Sports Campus at Abbotstown.

The report states that the planning application “will provide Cricket Ireland (CI) with a permanent, world-class facility, within the home of Irish Sport”.

An evaluation of the stadium’s economic impact carried out by EY shows that €39.9m would be spent as a result of the 2030 T20 World Cup Cricket tournament, which is to be co-hosted by Ireland, Scotland and England.

The EY findings show that, based on an average year’s operation, the centre would support 460 jobs per year in the period 2026 to 2030.

Overall, including the impact of the Cricket World Cup in 2030, the net impact of the centre would result in 1,555 jobs.

The planning report states that a one-off capacity of 20,000 will be required for the T20 Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2030, and as it is a one-off, it will likely require an events license closer to the time.

A report lodged with the application also stated the economy will benefit from co-hosting the Cricket World Cup in 2030 - where the centre will host a maximum of eight matches, with the remaining matches to be played in Ireland held in Malahide or Stormont.

Planning documents lodged show that the proposed development is likely to generate approximately 200 construction jobs.Outlining the need for the development, it states that “Cricket Ireland has no home of its own. It needs a home of its own. It cannot rely on using club facilities, much to the club's inconvenience and at great cost.”",Connaught Telegraph,2025-10-03T16:05:42Z,https://www.con-telegraph.ie/2025/10/03/plans-go-ahead-for-e35m-national-cricket-centre-in-fingal/,0.09019607843137245,2025-10-04 00:11:23.456489,0.8999999999999999,"['plans', 'ahead', '€35m', 'fingal', 'cricket', 'centre', 'national', '2030', 'ireland', 'world', 'cup', 'planning', 'million', 'sport', 'report', 'states', 't20', 'matches', 'generate', 'capacity', 'impact', 'jobs', 'council', '€35', 'host', '2026', 'period', 'construction', 'ncc', 'include', 'permanent', 'maximum', '000', 'application', 'ey']"

Comm min recommends anti-dumping duty on solar cells from China for 3 yrs | Headlines,"Comm min recommends anti-dumping duty on solar cells from China for 3 yrs
- Country:
- India
The commerce ministry's investigation arm DGTR has recommended the imposition of anti-dumping duty for three years on import of solar cells from China, with an aim to guard domestic players from cheap imports.
In its final findings, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has concluded that 'Solar Cells whether or not assembled in Modules or made up into Panels' have been exported to India at a price below the normal value, resulting in dumping.
The injury to the domestic industry has been caused by the dumping of the product, the DGTR has said in a notification.
''The authority recommends imposition of definitive anti-dumping duty on the imports... for a period of 3 years... as a percentage of the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) value of the goods,'' it said.
It has recommended the duty as percentage of CIF value. For certain Chinese firms, the recommended duty is 23 per cent, while for some others it is 30 per cent of the CIF value of the product.
While the DGTR recommends the duty, the finance ministry takes the final decision to impose the same.
Sunlight is converted into electricity through a process called photovoltaics (PV). This involves several key components working together to harness the energy from the sun. At the core are solar cells, which are made from silicon. These are grouped together and mounted on a solar panel or module which captures sunlight and converts it into direct current (DC) electricity.
The DGTR has also recommended imposition of the duty on imports of ''Virgin Multi-Layer Paperboards'' from Chile and China.
It has suggested the levy in the range of USD 152.27 per ton to USD 221.36 per ton. ''The authority recommends imposition of anti-dumping duty on the imports... for a period of 5 years,'' another notification has said.
An anti-dumping duty has also been suggested for five years on imports of ''Soda Ash'' originating in or exported from Turkey, Russia, USA and Iran.
A duty in the range of USD 31.58 per ton to USD 75 per ton has been recommended by the directorate on imports of ''Calcium Carbonate Filler Masterbatch'' from Vietnam.
Anti-dumping probes are conducted by countries to determine whether domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in cheap imports.
As a countermeasure, they impose these duties under the multilateral regime of Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO). All these nations are members of multilateral organisations that deal with global trade norms.
The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a level playing field for domestic producers vis-a-vis foreign producers and exporters.
India has already imposed anti-dumping duty on several products to tackle cheap imports from various countries, including China.

Mary Holm: How to open a bank account without a fixed address,"“People without a fixed address can still open a bank account, although the process can be a bit more challenging,” a Reserve Bank spokeswoman says.

“Banks are required to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations, which means verifying a person’s identity and their address. Where someone doesn’t have a permanent home, there should be alternative options for banks to verify a temporary address. For example, a bank may accept a temporary address or a letter from a trusted organisation, such as a housing provider or a community support agency, to meet address verification requirements.”

As a first step, contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) – see cab.org.nz, or a financial mentoring service, which you can access through moneytalks.co.nz. Both offer free services.

“These organisations can help people to get access to a bank account, such as helping people to get ID or a proof of address letter,” the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) spokeswoman says.

Another suggestion is to contact Westpac, which has started a “basic bank account,” designed for people in your sort of situation.

Meanwhile, the broader issue is being addressed. “At the Reserve Bank, we are working with banks and regulators to make access to accounts easier. The Council of Financial Regulators will publish decisions later this year on options to enable everyone to access simple transaction accounts,” the spokeswoman says.

“Finally, [the] RBNZ supports efforts to remove barriers to accessing basic banking services through reforms to AML/CFT requirements being led by the Ministry of Justice.”

Scam warning

Q: On Instagram, I was sent an advertisement that had your name, inviting me to join for 100-day free advice on share investments.

My son and I decided to join, relying on your safe hands reputation. We have become increasingly concerned it is a scam. I have not given them my bank account details but they are asking for them, on the basis they want to provide me compensation for a share trade loss.

I wanted to let you know in case this isn’t you, as numerous others may have joined on the basis of your name. If it is you, then please also let me know?

A: It’s a scam! I replied to you right away but, with your permission, I’m running your email here in case others are caught up in this.

This scam first emerged on Facebook and Instagram in mid-August. I ran a warning in my August 23 column and on my website, and the Weekend Herald ran an article about it. But clearly you and others didn’t get the message. It’s worrying.

My first question to you was whether you had sent them any money. Your reply: “Not directly, I have my own Hatch account. I invested in three shares that they recommended. One of them lost money on Friday and they wanted my bank account to give me ‘compensation’ on the share loss. That’s when I became suspicious.”

Phew! I hope nobody else has sent them money or bank account details. Anyone who has should contact their bank immediately and also contact Netsafe or ownyouronline.govt.nz.

It’s interesting that the crooks are offering to give you money, rather than taking it from you. They might even live up to their offer, a clever way to increase your trust in them – and to obtain your bank details.

If you continued, somewhere along the line you would be sure to give them way more money than they ever gave you. And that’s the last you’d see of it.

In case anything like this emerges again: I will never be involved in any scheme of this kind. I earn a living as a freelance journalist, giving talks, writing books and sitting on a few non-profit boards. That’s all.

By the way, I note that you are a professional person and clearly an accomplished one. Anybody can get caught up in a scam!

Getting aggressive

Q: We have a mortgage-free home and my salary is $135,000. I’m not sure what to do with savings coming every month.

I am changing my KiwiSaver from 3% to 10% since I have noticed the aggressive fund is increasing the balance very aggressively, which I haven’t noticed in the past.

I just checked. I moved to that fund on May 18, so in four months, $182,000 has grown to $203,000, which is unbelievable. It does not make sense to put money in the bank. This is the only reason I am moving to 10% from 3%.

I know the risk associated, but I am sure in the next 20 years it will work out. I won’t need this extra money, even if I am going to be stuck for the next 18 years, but will have a good return, I am guessing.

I hope I did okay by not putting the money in a term investment, which does not pay much. I think this will pay out handsomely when I withdraw at 65. I will change to conservative and balanced funds (less risky) after I’m 60 to 62.

The reasoning behind going with big bank KiwiSaver rather than any NZ-based provider is that they are already managing my share portfolio, so why take extra risk and pay extra fees?

Being an accountant, I can work out the maths behind this increase and just wanted to share with you this unusual return.

PS: I just hope the world won’t crash and these investments will be nothing after that many years.

A: Picture this: Your $203,000 balance has dropped to $100,000.

Your aggressive KiwiSaver fund will almost certainly be largely invested in shares. And while it’s rare, sharemarket indexes have halved at times over the decades. Sometimes it’s taken several years to get back to where you were. Will you stick with your investment when it plunges?

You seem to tick the boxes for ability to weather a storm:

While the state of the world is worrying these days, we’ve been there before and over the long term, share values have always fluctuated but trended upwards.

You’re quite right that returns have been extraordinary recently – and way ahead of bank-deposit interest. Both the New Zealand and world share indexes floundered early in the year, dropping to lows in April after US President Donald Trump announced aggressive tariffs.

But since then, they have rebounded. The S&P NZX50 share index has grown 14% just since April and the MSCI world index has grown an astonishing 32%. You missed about half the gains by starting in May, but still you’ve done really well.

On keeping your KiwiSaver with your bank, I don’t think that’s necessary. Their schemes tend to be lacklustre. And you won’t pay extra fees elsewhere. In fact, in several low-fee providers, you’ll probably pay considerably less.

Yes, but not for paying rates

Q: I have recently finished work, having reached 65, and I’m still coming to grips with the new reality of time-rich, income-limited. Innately fiscally conservative, I have our main family savings in term deposits.

However, with regular, immediately accessible bank accounts yielding not much, I’m being advised by some family members to put $150,000 back into my KiwiSaver account in a balanced (rather than growth) fund and use this account for things like rates, occasional holidays, possible emergencies etc.

While you never know what’s round the corner, the idea of using a balanced fund as an investment but also as an emergency fund seems like quite a good idea. Just wondering what you think?

A: It’s a good idea to move some of your savings to a KiwiSaver balanced fund. But I wouldn’t use that money for rates or emergencies or holidays – unless the holidays are several years away.

Balanced funds typically invest roughly half their money in shares and most of the rest in bonds. Shares are volatile, as discussed above. And bond returns can be volatile too, with downturns when interest rates rise because older bonds, issued at lower interest rates, lose value.

It’s no great surprise, then, that in two of the last 10 years, balanced KiwiSaver funds recorded small losses. In the year ending March 2020, in the Covid downturn, the average return after fees and tax was -0.9%. And in the year ending March 2023, it was -2.6%.

But I don’t want to scare you off! In 2024, the average return was 10.7%. And in 2021, it was a huge 17.4%. In several other years, it was more than 5%. And don’t forget, when comparing this with term deposits, that these returns are after fees and tax. Over time, you will almost certainly get higher average returns than in the bank.

The way to cope with the ups and downs is to plan to spend the balanced-fund money in roughly three to 10 years. Your short-term spending money – for rates, emergencies, food, power, transport and so on, plus hopefully some fun – is best left in term deposits and bank accounts.

Every year or so, move some money from your balanced fund to the bank, to keep about three years of spending money in cash. Be a bit flexible. If the balanced fund’s balance has fallen lately, you could delay the move for a while. And if it’s done well lately, you could move a bit more than usual.

I hope you do use a balanced fund. It could well mean that you’re able to have more than occasional holidays.

No garage tap

Q: Amen to the advice you have given recently about not investing in rental property in your retirement, but using the money to spend.

For decades in the US, we built up a sizeable retirement account under the guidance of a financial planner. Over 30 years now, we are very confident of the advice we get. We are in our early 70s. Our investments are widely diversified and increasingly conservative. We invested some money in property in New Zealand, but we never enjoyed being landlords. In more recent years, large increases in rates, insurance, maintenance and management have wiped out any return.

Moreover, there isn’t a tap on the garage wall from which to siphon off $10,000 for a trip overseas. Aware of Kiwi dependence on investing in houses, our US adviser sees a likely structural change in the market. She suggests it’s not wise in the near term to expect great returns from new investment. We all agree that we bought property to save for a future that has now arrived for us.

It’s time to use term deposits to park cash and to start spending our property gains to date. We are. While we can.

A: Good on you – or, as they say in America, good for you!

I’m not sure a US adviser would be the first person I would turn to for advice on the New Zealand property market. But many retired landlords find that the hassles and expenses – sometimes unexpected – are something they can do without. They have better things to do with the money.

Why not?

Q: Regarding last week’s late-70s couple seeking to increase their disposable income, why didn’t you suggest that they rent out their under-used holiday home for part of the year? Is there any reason why this wouldn’t be a viable option for them?

A: Renting out the holiday home would, of course, be one way to free up some cash – albeit much less than if they sold the property. But see the above Q&A.

Still, it might be worth it for people wanting to keep the place for children to inherit, or simply because they love to go there.

ICE Canola: Pressure Returns for Canola,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba--Canola futures on the Intercontinental Exchange were going down in the middle of Friday trading, mainly due to weaker vegetable oils, harvest pressure and a lack of exports.

Chicago soyoil, European rapeseed and Malaysian palm oil were down. However, crude oil was higher after Russia attacked Ukrainian natural gas facilities last night.

An analyst said November canola may try to test the support level of C$600 per ton. The funds may also be squaring their positions ahead of the weekend.

Alberta and Saskatchewan will see high temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius later today, while a chance of thunderstorms is present for southern Manitoba. Temperatures in Manitoba are expected to drop to normal next week.

New Indigenous-owned sablefish farm proposed for Kyuquot Sound,"Tiicma Fisheries Inc., a venture of Ka:’yu:’k’t’h’/Che:k:tles7et’h’ First Nations (KCFN), is in the process of applying to the Ministry of Transport for a tenure site and licence to operate a sablefish facility in Kyuquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island.

The proposed aquaculture finfish facility is located 11.5-kilometres from Houpsitas, a KCFN village, and about 12-kilometres from Fair Harbour, the marina facility owned by the nation.

Pinnace Channel is the presented waterway for the site, which will be floating adjacent to Hohoae Island.

According to Tiicma’s Transport Canada application (file number 2001-500751), the sablefish facility will include a floathouse, feed barge and 10 cages within a 30-by-30-metre area.

“A compliment of three staff (minimum) will reside on the floathouse to manage aquaculture operations,” reads Tiicma’s application.

Currently, there are three marine aquaculture facilities for sablefish in British Columbia, two of which are active and situated in Kyuquot Sound, while a single inactive facility lies in Barkley Sound, according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

The two active facilities, Charlie’s Place and Centre Cove, are currently licensed for 2,700 and 2,202 metric tons of sablefish, respectively, whereas the Barkley Sound facility is licensed for 550 metric tons, according to DFO.

Golden Eagle Sablefish operates the two active sablefish sites in partnership with KCFN and produces sablefish, also known as black cod, products for both local and international markets.

The licences for all three sablefish facilities were issued on July 1, 2024 and expire in 2030. Salmon farms have until 2029 to remove their open net pens from Pacific waters, but this ban does not apply to sablefish aquaculture.

“Sablefish farms are not included in the Government of Canada’s plan to phase out open net-pen salmon aquaculture in B.C.,” according to DFO.

Sablefish, also known as black cod, are deep-water marine fish with a northern amphi-Pacific distribution and high fisheries value, estimated at approximately $27.9 million per year between 2012 and 2022, according to DFO.

Daniel Rabu, Tiicma Fisheries general manager, says the new finfish facility at Hohoae Island will be wholly owned by Tiicma Fisheries. He declined to comment further until the application process is finalized.

"'I've Done It Twice Now': Charlotte Woman Goes On $4,000 'Shopping Spree.' Then She Gets American Airlines To Reimburse Her After Flights To Miami, San Diego. Here's How","What if every time your baggage was delayed, you got to go on a $4,000 shopping spree? For one traveler, that fantasy became reality twice.

A delayed baggage nightmare turned into hours of shopping thanks to an airline reimbursement policy most passengers don’t know exists.

Here’s how you can tap into this policy, too.

Shopping Spree Courtesy Of American Airlines

In a trending video with more than 29,000 views, content creator Lexie (@lexieb93) walked viewers through the exact process she used to get reimbursed for delayed baggage. Though she noted airline staff weren’t always forthcoming with information about the policy.

“I’ve gotten a few questions on how I’ve successfully had American Airlines reimburse me—first time over $3,000, second time over a grand—for delayed baggage,” Lexie said.

Her first experience occurred when she flew into Miami and her baggage was delayed. After going to the customer service baggage area at the airport, a staff member handed her a piece of paper explaining the reimbursement policy.

“He’s like, you can get replacement items, and we will reimburse you up to $3,800. He highlights the number, and I was like, ‘Come again?’ I didn’t believe him. I was like, ‘There’s no way,'” Lexie said.

The employee explained that while certain items, like expensive jewelry, watches, and cameras, couldn’t be reimbursed, everyday necessities like clothes, makeup, and similar items were covered.

Lexie kept all her receipts, submitted them online within the 30-day period, and got reimbursed for about $3,100.

Not So Easy The Second Time Around

When Lexie’s baggage was delayed again in April during a trip to San Diego for a work gala, the customer service representative claimed to have never heard of the reimbursement policy.

“I’ve never heard of that,” the woman told her.

When pressed, the employee responded vaguely, saying “reasonable” would probably be OK.

Since the in-person worker wasn’t being helpful, Lexie contacted American through the app’s chatbot.

“I immediately get a response like, ‘Of course, be sure to keep your receipts, be sure to keep your claim number, and we will reimburse you for any items that you need while your luggage is delayed,'” the person told her.

Plus, she found out the reimbursement limit increased to over $4,000.

Lexie’s Tips For Getting Reimbursed

Here’s Lexie’s advice on what to do if you end up in the same situation:

Before leaving the airport, file a delayed or lost baggage claim with customer service. This generates a claim number needed to track the case. Keep the bag tag receipt from when the luggage was checked.

Ask airport staff about the reimbursement policy for replacement items. If they’re not helpful, use the chatbot.

Keep all receipts, and submit them within 30 days of filing the claim.

“I bought now probably over $4,500 worth of stuff that American Airlines has paid for, so thank you American Airlines, love you guys,” Lexie says.

Airlines Are Actually Required To Pay You Back

Here’s the thing most travelers don’t know: airlines are legally obligated to compensate you when your bags are delayed.

Under U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, airlines must reimburse passengers for verifiable incidental expenses, we’re talking up to $4,700 per passenger for domestic flights, NerdWallet reported.

Everything Lexie said about the process checks out.

American Airlines typically takes four to six weeks to process reimbursements. And as Lexie discovered, the airline doesn’t always advertise how much you can actually spend, even though the maximum liability follows federal guidelines.

It’s not just American Airlines, either. Alaska and Delta sweetened the deal with bonus miles if your bags take longer than 20 minutes to show up. And if you have a travel credit card, you might be sitting on even more coverage. Some cards offer up to $100 per day for delayed baggage.

Commenters React

“Rest assured is the chat bots favorite phrase,” a top comment read.

“What if you buy everything and they don’t reimburse you,” a person asked.

“Tragically they lost my entire luggage en route to Antarctica and didn’t reimburse me despite me having to drop 4K,” another shared.

“Girl!!! This is amazing!! I would cry if they lost my bag but this makes it better,” a commenter wrote.

Responding to US semiconductor policy shift - Taipei Times,"By Hsiao Hsi-huei 蕭錫惠

US President Donald Trump’s administration wants to push chipmakers to reach a 1:1 domestic-to-import ratio — otherwise, companies could face tariffs on foreign-made electronic devices based on the number of chips they contain. This major shift in US semiconductor strategy could pose a severe challenge for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), as it effectively requires that its US and Taiwan plants maintain pace with each other with regard to production capacity and manufacturing processes.

From the perspective of economist Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations, this essentially marks a resurgence of mercantilism. While the motivation is understandable, the approach contradicts the principle of comparative advantage. It would be difficult to implement in the short term and could ultimately prove detrimental to the US.

Over the past 30 years, China has leveraged cheap labor and government subsidies to become the “world’s factory,” drawing manufacturing and job opportunities away from the US. The US middle class has stagnated, and industrial towns are gradually declining. Trump’s voter base is made up of these groups that have been abandoned by globalization, so it is not difficult to understand why he aims to bring manufacturing back to the US.

However, semiconductors differ from traditional industries. They operate within a globally integrated system — they require lithography machines from the Netherlands, materials from Japan, are manufactured in Taiwan and designed in the US. Each part of this system is indispensable, and forcibly severing any of these links would inevitably harm efficiency.

The Wealth of Nations tells us that a nation’s wealth comes from specialization and free trade. The US’ comparative advantage lies in design and its market, while Taiwan’s lies in manufacturing and yield. If a forced 1:1 domestic-to-import ratio were imposed, it would effectively mitigate the value of specialization. The result would not be increased security for the US, but soaring costs, reduced efficiency and weakened industrial competitiveness. This is the mercantilism that Smith criticized — excessive government intervention, replacing market mechanisms with slogans and ultimately wasting societal resources.

Taiwan should engage in diplomatic negotiations to seek a transition period of five to 10 years so as to avoid immediate punitive tariffs. It should also promote a model based on technological equivalence rather than a strict 1:1 split in capacity, allowing US-based plants to focus on military and security-related needs.

Taiwan should also diversify and actively expand into Europe, Japan, India and Southeast Asia to reduce overreliance on the US.

Lastly, the nation must strengthen research and development efforts by investing in artificial intelligence, quantum chips and new materials to maintain Taiwan’s irreplaceable status in the global industrial chain.

Taiwan must rely on the US for national defense. Therefore, semiconductors and military affairs should be linked — this is the language of diplomatic negotiations.

TSMC’s investment in building plants in the US is not just an economic move, but a strategic signal reassuring US security concerns. Taiwan holds a substantial annual trade surplus with the US, and could thus consider increasing its arms and equipment purchases to balance this, thereby turning an economic surplus into a strategic investment. This approach would both ease US concerns over trade imbalances and secure more stable military cooperation to jointly face the challenges posed by China.

Trump’s 1:1 domestic-to-import ratio policy on semiconductors reflects US anxiety over China’s rise and the loss of its domestic manufacturing industry. While the motivation behind it is reasonable, the approach contravenes the economic principles presented in The Wealth of Nations and would be difficult to sustain long-term.

Taiwan must demonstrate wisdom by preserving its efficiency and comparative advantage, exchanging defense procurement and cooperation for US security commitments. Taiwan is not only the core of the global chip supply chain, but also a democratic front line. Only by reaching an economic and military consensus with the US could the two countries jointly face the challenges presented by China.

Will UPSC Publish Provisional Answer Keys Early? Latest News,"UPSC Provisional Answer Keys: A notice has gone viral on social media platform X (earlier called Twitter) saying that UPSC has decided to release a provisional answer key right after the preliminary civil services exam. Uptil now thhe Union Public Service Commission usually puts out the answer key only after the final results come out, which takes many months.

The document that is being shared online carries the name of Himanshu Kumar, Joint Secretary (Exam), UPSC. In that note, he says he is affirming under oath about a writ petition that is still in court. The writ petition made UPSC one of the respondents, and it is still waiting for a final hearing.

He adds that the Commission had a discussion on many points, including suggestions from the amicus appointed by the court. After this, he says UPSC came to a decision of “publishing the Provisional Answer Key, after the Preliminary Examination is conducted.”

According to the same notice, once UPSC uploads this provisional answer key, candidates can send in objections or representations. For each objection, the student has to show three strong sources to prove their point. The Commission will then see if the sources are reliable or not.

All the doubts and answer objections will be given to a team of subject experts who will study every detail carefully. This team will then finalise the answer key. The prelims result will be based on this finalised answer key. Later after the final exam results are out the UPSC will again publish the final answer key for public record.

UPSC Chief gave Clarity

This buzz started only a few days after UPSC chairman Dr Ajay Kumar explained why the Commission does not release answer keys before the results. He said that UPSC first checks the answers internally with its own team of experts. After that they open an online portal where students can raise doubts and give feedback.

He explained “We open a portal now for candidates where students can raise their doubts and queries regarding questions. On the basis of these inputs, our experts review the answer key again and make changes, if needed. This answer key is then reviewed by another panel, after which the key is finalised and released.”

He made it clear that the process already allows students to put their queries forward, and every stage of the checking is done very carefully. This shows that as of now, UPSC has not made any final move to release the answer key before results. The Commission has also not put any official announcement about this matter on its website or on its social media pages.",Newsd.in,2025-10-03T16:05:35Z,https://newsd.in/will-upsc-publish-provisional-answer-keys-early-latest-news/,0.1372549019607843,2025-10-04 00:12:03.244940,0.9999999999999999,"['publish', 'early', 'latest', 'answer', 'upsc', 'provisional', 'keys', 'key', 'commission', 'final', 'results', 'release', 'exam', 'doubts', 'team', 'experts', 'students', 'notice', 'social', 'media', 'preliminary', 'public', 'online', 'kumar', 'writ', 'petition', 'court', '2025', 'candidates', 'objections', 'sources', 'carefully', 'result', 'finalised', 'explained']"

Humorous Petroleum V. Nasby was a snippy orator,"Nineteenth- and 20th-century humorists often found fodder in political topics. They were precedents for our Jon Stewart, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert. In fact, the New York Times in 2012 headlined an opinion piece “The Stephen Colbert of the Civil War.” The reference was to Petroleum Vesuvius Nasby.
Nasby was really David Ross Locke (1833-1888), a writer of comedic letters and traveling stage humorist. Born in Vestal, N.Y., he worked as a tramp printer until finding regular employment with the Pittsburgh Chronicle.
He later started a newspaper, the Plymouth (Ohio) Herald. He began writing his amusing but pointed letters when editing the Jeffersonian in Ohio. He “lectured” in Great Barrington in January 1872. He called his program “The Mission of Skinogh.”
A vociferous supporter of the North, Nasby/Locke was at his peak of popularity (and political influence) during the Civil War as he adopted the persona of a prejudiced hick sympathetic to Southern slaveholders. His biting dialect letters, with crude spellings in the Josh Billings mode, appeared in the Toledo Blade and were collected in a book, The Nasby Papers, in 1864.
President Abraham Lincoln found him entertaining.
Nasby’s writings “exercised much influence in molding popular opinion, upholding as they did the policy of the Lincoln administration. In late years the satire of the letters was aimed at President Johnson,” noted a writer in the Morning Pioneer.
Nasby’s prose is painful to read these days, both for its misspellings and bad grammar and its vitriol. This is an example from 1861:
“Wingert’s Corners, March the 21st, 1861.
“South Caroliny and sevral other uv the trooly Dimecratic States hev secesht — gone orf, I may say, onto a journey after ther rites
“Wingert’s Corners, e trooly Dimecratic ez any uv em, hez fullered soot.
“A meeting wuz held last nite, uv which I wuz chairman, to take the matter uv our grievances in2 consideration, and it wuz finally resolved that nothin short uv secesh wood remedy our woes. Therefore the follerin address, which I rit, wuz adopted and ordered to be publisht....”
Pittsfield’s Young Men’s Association engaged the humorist in 1868 to orate at Burbank Hall. “The lecture to commence at 7½ o’clock precisely. Petroleum is brim full of fun and his ‘Kussed be Canaan’ sparkles with wit,” The Berkshire Eagle told readers.
Reporting on the program, the newspaper said: “Mr. Nasby, or rather Mr. Locke, is a man of progressive ideas, he has depth as well as breadth, and good sense is no less a distinguishing trait of his character, than the mother wit with which he runs over. Notwithstanding Mr. Locke now occupies an enviable position he's still a growing man. His moral character is unexceptionable, and he seems to be actuated by the noble purpose of raising down-trodden humanity to a higher plane of life. … The speaker was so limited for time, being obliged to take the nine o’clock train for the west, that he could to do himself or the occasion justice.”
His program had lasted only 80 minutes.
Locke/Nasby — a century before mass media — had to deliver his message in person, and had 200 engagements on his calendar. His hosts were in the Northeast and West.
His early inspiration came, when he was editor of The Jeffersonian. “The circulation of a petition asking the Legislature to remove all the colored people from the State and to forbid their coming into Ohio suggested to Mr. Locke the idea of the Nasby letters,” the New York Tribune told readers.
Nasby in his first letter endorsed (not really) the opinions of the citizens of the fictitious Crawford County, Ohio, which was intensely disloyal, the citizens being almost to a man secessionists. Its subject was the secession of South Carolina. The next letter took up the petition for the removal of the [N]egroes, and this was followed week after week, by others, each one seizing upon some weak or traitorous point in [then right-wing] Democratic or rebel policy and holding it up mercilessly to scorn and laugher. They were copied into newspapers all over the country.”
The Berkshire Eagle reproduced the letters in 1864.
Did humor pay? Not much at first, but by 1882, by one published account, Nasby/Locke as well as Josh Billings (Henry Wheeler Shaw) of Lanesborough and Mark Twain (Clemens) of Connecticut were easily worth $150,000 each.
Nasby collected his material in several books published by Lee & Shepard of Boston. “The writings of Nasby have never been surpassed in their humorous features, and sparkle with wit, irony, pathos and good sense, narrated in a dialect, of which he was a perfect master,” The Eagle said.
A number of high-level political figures attended Locke’s funeral, including former President Rutherford B. Hayes.
Humorists did get respect.
The Pittsfield Sun, which had once snuffed, “The greatest coot who ever set himself up for a wit, is ‘Petroleum V. Nasby.’ He hasn’t ability enough to entertain the pit of a second rate traveling menagerie,” conceded in 1888, ”It is seldom that a ‘funny man’ dies poor. Petroleum V. Nasby left a $1,000,000 estate. It pays to make people laugh in this world.”
Nasby, as well as Samuel Clemens and Harriet Beecher Stowe, lectured at Julia Sumner Hall in the Sumner Block in Great Barrington. The former was funny; the latter wasn’t. All were entertaining.",The Berkshire Eagle,2025-10-03T16:00:00Z,https://www.berkshireeagle.com/history/humorist-petroleum-v-nasby-snippy-orator/article_29d3ecbb-9d10-4dc7-8214-f1ffa1a76c2c.html,0.1764705882352942,2025-10-04 00:12:13.243323,0.9999999999999999,
"A mall for all (furry babies, too)","The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) has officially conferred its first-ever Certified Pet-Friendly Seal to Ayala Malls Vertis North, in recognition of the establishment’s commitment to creating a safe, welcoming environment for people and their beloved companion animals.

The certification underscores the mall’s inclusive pet policy that welcomes all breeds – showing that pet-friendliness goes beyond pedigrees and embraces all animals equally. Ayala Malls Vertis North is also a proud KabaliCAT partner, supporting PAWS’ Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return (TNVR) program for its community cats. Through this collaboration, the mall not only provides pet-friendly spaces but also contributes directly to responsible and humane population management of stray animals.

“The PAWS Pet-Friendly Seal is our way of honoring establishments that go the extra mile for companion animals and their humans,” said PAWS Executive Director Atty. Anna Cabrera. “We commend Ayala Malls Vertis North for its inclusivity in welcoming aspins and puspins, and for its active partnership in TNVR through KabaliCAT. This is what true pet-friendliness looks like —creating safe spaces while also addressing animal welfare at the community level.”

For his part, Ayala Corporation vice chairman Fernando Zobel De Ayala said, “In our malls, animal welfare is more than a policy - it’s a reflection of who we are as a community. We believe responsible pet ownership begins with kindness, and we strive to live that value every day.”

He continued, “The reality is, our country faces many challenges with abandoned dogs and cats, but we’re committed to doing our part. When we treat pets as beloved family members—ensuring their safety, health, and happiness—we create places that are vibrant, inclusive, and truly humane. Together, we’re building a culture of care that benefits everyone.”

The trend of bringing dogs to malls began to gain traction in 2010 onwards and reached its peak during the pandemic when pets were considered as the new “kids” of young professionals who choose not to have children,” Cabrera added. “With seniors and children were not allowed to go to public places due to covid, it was the pet owners who became the regular customers of malls, restaurants and other shops.”

It is important because a lot of establishments put up “pet friendly” signs to capture the growing market of pet owners. However, not all of them are really pet friendly because they discriminate as to the size or breed of the dog as experienced by a fur mom last year when her pet Aspin was not allowed to enter a “pet-friendly” restaurant that had breeded dogs inside.

PAWS’ Certified Pet-Friendly seal is given only to those establishments which we have road tested (through our ‘undercover’ volunteers who bring their aspins and various dogs with them).

The Certified Pet-Friendly Seal is a mark of assurance that restaurants, malls, and other establishments carrying it welcome all dogs, including aspins and native breeds, allow pets to enter or dine with their families without discrimination, and are committed to policies rooted in inclusion, safety and compassion

The Seal serves as a guide for all animal lovers and responsible pet parents who are eager to support businesses that treat our furry companions as truly cherished members of the family.

Present during the event were Malls Corporate Chief-of-Staff Meigan Soriano, Ayala Malls Vertis North Deputy General Manager Ayi Alzola and Ayala Malls Vertis North Senior Marketing Associate Nica Santiago as well as PAWS Directors Cristina Martinez and Rich Ilustre.

This marks the official conferment of the PAWS Pet-Friendly Seal to a shopping mall, setting a standard for other establishments to follow in promoting responsible pet ownership and animal welfare in the country.

"""Hell"" for Migrant Workers: The Human Cost of Saudi Arabia's Green Energy Boom - Business & Human Rights Resource Centre","…The cranes and solar arrays stretching across the Saudi desert are meant to symbolise a future built on clean, sustainable power. But for the migrant workers toiling to build this future, the reality is one of exploitation, fear, and dehumanisation, described by one worker as “hell” and conditions “like jail.”

These are the findings of an explosive new report, “The Human Cost of Saudi Arabia’s Green Energy Boom,” published today by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), an international NGO that tracks the human rights impacts of companies across the globe. The investigation uncovers egregious human rights abuses on nine flagship renewable energy projects…

4 Beitbridge customs agents arrested over Zimra fraud,"by Staff reporter

Police have arrested four Beitbridge-based customs agents linked to a recent breach of the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) customs system that saw thousands of dollars fraudulently credited to agents' accounts.

The accused are Isaac Mazengera (52), director of IT Maze Forwarders Ltd; Tausa Sithole (50), director of Queenlight Investments Pvt Ltd; Norman Magonga (43), director of Inhle Clearing Pvt Ltd; and Shamiso Mubonderi (42) of Hyperclass Investments T/A Asante Sana. Their companies are also facing charges of fraud.

The breach occurred on July 11, allowing the agents to divert large sums held in bond accounts used to pay duty and levies. Prosecutors said IT Maze Forwarders defrauded Zimra of US$25,056 and ZWG166,289, while Queenlight Investments misappropriated ZWG2.09 million and US$20,828. Inhle Clearing allegedly defrauded Zimra of ZWG2.15 million, and Asante Sana obtained ZWG1.9 million.

The four initially appeared before Beitbridge Resident Magistrate Ms Patience Madondo and are expected back in court for a formal bail application. Zimra and police investigations are ongoing, with the revenue authority having rectified the system breach and deactivated select user accounts pending further legal action.

Glass half full for Wetherspoon's shareholders,"The company, which operates nearly 800 outlets across the UK and Ireland, has struggled to return to pre-pandemic levels of profitability as soaring energy and wage costs have eaten into rising sales. Shares today were more than 4% lower as of late afternoon trading.

Wetherspoons return to profit for first time since pandemic

""Wetherspoon's mention of rising labour costs and higher energy levies cast a pall over the rise in profits and improved sales figures,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.

""As a result, more of the bounce in shares from earlier in the year continues to drain away. The market was clearly in the mood for something more, and today's update provides little reason for a change in the current share price direction.""

Wetherspoon says its energy and labour costs have risen by 58% and 35% respectively since 2019, while sales of more than £2.1 billion are up 17% during the same period.

The recently-introduced extended producer responsibility (EPR) levy on packaging will triple the company’s costs on this front from £800,000 to £2.4m a year. Energy costs will rise by a further £7m annually due to what Mr Martin described as ""non-commodity"" elements of electricity charges.

Like-for-like sales during the year to July 27 rose by 5% to £2.1bn, while profits were 10% higher at £81.4m.

Received Sebi approval to go ahead with Fortis open offer: IHH Healthcare | Law-Order,"The stalled open offer for a 26.1 per cent stake in Fortis Healthcare by IHH Healthcare Berhad has finally been approved by the capital market regulator Sebi, seven years after the Malaysian firm acquired 31.1 per cent in the Indian hospital chain, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), pursuant to its letter dated October 1, 2025, has approved IHH's request to proceed with an open offer for Fortis Healthcare and its arm Fortis Malar Hospitals, IHH Healthcare Berhad said in a filing to the Malaysian Stock Exchange.

The same was shared on BSE by Fortis Healthcare.

IHH's open offer for Fortis got stuck due to the legal fights, including at the Supreme Court, between Daiichi Sankyo and the former promoters of Fortis Healthcare, Singh Brothers -- Malvinder and Shivinder -- with the Japanese firm seeking to recover Rs 3,500 crore awarded to it by a Singapore tribunal in its case related to the acquisition of erstwhile Ranbaxy.

However, in September 2022, IHH said that the Supreme Court, in a ruling, had paved the way for the open offer, subject to approval from Sebi.

The matter dates back to 2018, when IHH clinched a Rs 4,000-crore deal to acquire 31.1 per cent stake in Fortis Healthcare, beating rival Manipal-TPG combine in the race.

Subsequently, IHH's open offer for an additional 26 per cent stake in Fortis was scheduled to commence on December 18, 2018, and close on January 1, 2019, entailing a total sum of Rs 3,300 crore.

However, in December 2018, the Supreme Court ordered status quo with regard to the sale of controlling stakes in Fortis Healthcare to IHH Healthcare by former Ranbaxy promoters and hospital operators -- Malvinder and Shivinder Singh, following a plea from Daiichi Sankyo.

The apex court's order put on hold IHH's open offer for an additional 26.1 per cent stake in Fortis.

Daiichi Sankyo was seeking enforcement of a foreign arbitral award made in Singapore on April 29, 2016, to the tune of Rs 3,600 crore in its favour and against 20 respondents, including Malvinder Mohan Singh, Director of Oscar Investments Ltd and RHC Holding Pvt Ltd and Shivinder Mohan Singh, Director of Oscar Investments Ltd.

The former promoters of Fortis Healthcare Ltd were facing a court battle after Daiichi had challenged the Fortis-IHH share deal to recover the arbitration award.

XRP's Price Pinch: Triangle Hints at $3.60 Leap?,"Ripple coin (XRP) just restored the $3 confluent resistance level that has been on-watch for quite some time. The popular altcoin dwindled below this line on September, 21, 2025, as geopolitical tensions brought in a considerable amount of uncertainty.

XRP Coils In Triangle, Crypto Hedges Against USD

Surely, the United States government shutdown has played a huge part in the rebound rally this week, kicking off ‘Uptober’ with a positive attitude. The historically-bullish month for most crypto currencies comes at a time when investors are boosting their portfolios with crypto as a hedge against the weakened U.S. dollar.

Ripple’s (XRP) price caught the bullish impulse and now is looking to break-out from a triangle pattern known as the falling wedge brings new opportunities. In crypto, this converging triangle measures the distance the altcoin can go in the next bull run, employing historical data-driven Fibonacci Retracement levels.

XRP Price Sets Sights On $3.60 If This Level Holds

As pointed out today by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, $3.65 is most likely the next target if the OG altcoin sustains above $3. Notably, this falls just 5 cents below with the all-time high (ATH), inked two months ago.

The earlier breakthrough was fueled with multiple positive regulatory decisions, including the settlement of Ripple vs. SEC case & the smooth clearing of Genius & Clarity Acts.

On the other hand, the recent findings of SEC being short-handed & even unable to hold press conferences raises the question if any of those 11 Ripple-based ETFs are getting settled anytime soon. Despite ending the legal lawsuit with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on good terms & paying a $50 million fine, the legal battles don’t stop there, as ETF submissions might drag on through 2026 unless the U.S. government parties agree to a compromise.

Whitmer warns tariffs hurt Michigan ahead of Carney-Trump talks,"(The Center Square) – Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced he will visit Washington D.C. next week in an effort to advance conversations on lessening America’s tariffs on its northern neighbor.
This comes just days after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer visited Canada, where she gave a speech discussing the effects of tariffs.
In that speech, Whitmer focused on the negative effects of tariffs on Michigan businesses, especially the automotive industry.
“Tariffs are putting the middle class in a tough spot,” Whitmer said. “I’ve been very clear that I’m not opposed to tariffs outright, but we can’t treat them like a ‘one size fits all’ solution . . . Swinging the tariff hammer hurts us both, damaging supply chains, slowing production lines, and cutting jobs on both sides of the border.”
Currently, Canada already has the lowest average tariff rate of any American trading partner, with just 15% of its trade facing tariffs.
Still, Whitmer called the rhetoric coming from Washington D.C. “unwise, unnecessary, and unjustified,” ultimately arguing that China is the ultimate winner in the tariff wars.
“The only winner here is China. They’re coming for our auto industry,” Whitmer said. “China would love nothing more than to watch us cripple our own economies. We can’t afford to serve them the North American auto ecosystem on a silver platter. And we cannot turn our backs on each other, not now, not ever. We must keep talking and keep showing up for each other. We will get through this together.”
That is a message Whitmer said she has taken to The White House – meeting with President Donald Trump multiple times already since he was elected for his second term.
Carney’s office announced Friday that he will travel to Washington D.C. on Monday, with plans to meet with Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday.
That comes ahead of a review of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. That agreement is the world’s second-largest free trade region.
“Canada and the U.S. each launched consultations last month that will inform preparations for the first joint review,” Carney’s office said in a statement. “The Prime Minister’s working visit will focus on shared priorities in a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the U.S.”
Trump’s office, and Republicans, argue tariffs will ultimately boost manufacturing in the United States.

HBAR ETF On Ice: SEC's Bare-Bones Squad Battles Shutdown Blues,"The recent United States government shutdown has served quite a strong chill pill to the crypto community, expecting to see an altcoin exchange-traded (ETF) product to launch by year-end, or at least get approved by the SEC. However, The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reported to be extremely short-handed since the government’s pause.

According to Crypto Journalist Eleanor Terrett, the lock-out puts popular altcoin-based ETF, such as Canary Capital’s pitches on Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) & Litecoin (LTC) on an indefinite time line. With the chaos in place, there’s no full comprehension of available staff, with the Crypto Task Force heavily affected by this cut.

Bloomberg’s Analyst: “Crypto ETF Odds Are 100% Now”

With many press inquiries going unanswered, this adds up to the ongoing regulatory scrutiny, but the freshly published generic exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing standards paint a bright picture for altcoin-based ETFs in the long-term, argues Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas.

Previously, it was made known to the public that all altcoin-powered ETF are set to get a decision starting from mid October a.k.a ‘Uptober’ to late November, 2025, but now the deadline’s likely to extend further, as submissions from competing altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC) & XRP are also piling up.

HBAR Still Range-Bound.. Is $0.30 Target Still In Play?

While the broader crypto markets stood impervious to the political shenanigans and even saw a hefty inflow, Hedera (HBAR) continues to trade in a range-bound mode between $0.21 to $0.25 for the most part of September, and now dances around the $0.22 key support for a break towards the quarterly heights of $0.30.

On skeleton crew, there’s not much the SEC can do about handling HBAR ETF submissions, but the adoption doesn’t stop there – Hedera Hashgraph made the list of contenders for a SWIFT integration along with Ripple’s XRP Ledger for late 2025 testing. Ultimately, this would drive up trading volumes to unprecedented levels, typically followed by price appreciation.

'A powerful tool': New tech helps growers save fruit and labour,"“The process involves digitally mapping an orchard using the Green Atlas Cartographer and then downloading that data to our Tagga line marking unit,” Hoek said.

“The Tagga unit is then towed around the orchard by an ATV, automatically spraying the ground as it passes over it to clearly and precisely mark areas where scan data shows thinning is needed.”

In a trial on a kiwifruit orchard during the 2024/25 season, Tagga was used on a 1ha block while traditional thinning instructions were used on another comparable 1ha block.

The Tagga block results showed significant labour savings and much more targeted crop removal.

Labour time dropped by 35% – a saving of 44 hours – and around 60,000 fewer fruit were removed in areas that didn’t need thinning.

“When we consider the value of gold kiwifruit, saving just 1000 good pieces of fruit from being thinned pays for the Tagga application,” Hoek said.

“Add to this labour savings and potential fruit quality gains, and it’s clear this can be a powerful tool for growers.”

This season, Tagga will be available as an on-call service for apple and kiwifruit growers in Hawke’s Bay and Bay of Plenty.

Fruition Hawke’s Bay is also exploring future models that could allow orchardists to operate the units themselves.

“Precision horticulture is making waves internationally because of its potential to help orchardists tailor their approach to different parts of their orchard, whether for nutrient treatment or deciding which specific vines or trees need spraying,” Hoek said.

“The way we have used the technology for Tagga is the first time anywhere, to our knowledge, that precision horticulture technology has been used to physically spray the ground to guide horticulture workers.”

Hoek said Fruition Hawke’s Bay hoped to expand its suite of precision tools, building on the Green Atlas scanning service to help growers make even more targeted decisions.

“In the exact same way we are painting lines at the base of select trees, we could instead be spreading fertiliser, root pruning, or spraying plant growth regulators.

“As these technologies become more available to growers, the value that can be derived from Green Atlas scan data will only get greater.”",NZ Herald,2025-10-03T16:00:00Z,https://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/tagga-orchard-innovation-brings-precision-to-fruit-thinning-in-hawkes-bay/6E3PBEITAZE4BN26IZSEEPS3KY/,0.04313725490196085,2025-10-04 00:12:52.934274,0.9999999999999999,"['innovation', 'brings', 'tagga', 'orchard', 'bay', 'thinning', 'fruit', 'hawke’s', 'precision', 'hoek', 'growers', 'green', 'atlas', 'data', 'spraying', 'kiwifruit', 'block', 'labour', 'horticulture', 'unit', 'ground', 'areas', 'scan', 'season', '1ha', 'savings', 'targeted', 'saving', 'potential', 'service', 'fruition', 'orchardists', 'trees', 'technology', 'process']"

EDITORIAL: Teachers face mounting issues - Taipei Times,"On the Teachers’ Day holiday last week, dozens of teachers protested outside the Ministry of Education, urging that something be done to address multiple issues in schools that are depriving the sector of talent and diminishing enthusiasm among educators.

Their concerns ranged from an increase in frivolous lawsuits and administrative overwork to an unfriendly work environment and what they describe as government policies disconnected from classroom realities.

The protesters also criticized a disciplinary process they say has become opaque and punitive, as the system allows vague, anonymous or even malicious complaints to damage a teacher’s reputation and career with little recourse or transparency.

These protests are part of a growing tide of dissatisfaction among educators across Taiwan. A national survey conducted by Shi Hsin University’s Opinion Poll Research Center in 2023 found that nearly one in three elementary, junior-high school and high-school teachers were deeply unhappy with their jobs, citing burnout, unrealistic expectations and poor policy coordination between ministries.

It is not difficult to see why morale is low. Educators are increasingly expected to serve as counselors, administrators, event planners and social workers — all while managing academic outcomes in a system that often fails them.

Parents are also creating pressure. According to the survey, the two most significant causes of dissatisfaction among teachers were being asked by parents to address issues better handled at home and heavy workloads resulting from parents’ unrealistic expectations.

The ministry has updated its guidelines for campus disciplinary processes and proposed legal reforms. However, the changes are not strong enough or aimed at core issues.

This disconnect is especially urgent given Taiwan’s broader demographic context. Student enrollment has dropped by 6.4 percent since 2019, and the downward trend is likely to continue as the birthrate declines. School closures in rural areas have already begun and there is growing anxiety in urban districts, where maintaining enrollment numbers is essential for continued funding and operation.

Some schools might feel pressured to appease parents to retain students — even at the expense of teachers’ well-being. When teachers feel unsupported or disposable in their roles, it undermines the stability of the very classrooms students depend on.

The government faces a delicate balancing act — meeting the rising expectations of parents and students while ensuring that teachers feel valued, supported and willing to remain in the profession.

Of course, teachers must be held to high standards — but they also deserve support, due process, clear disciplinary guidelines and reasonable protection from bad-faith accusations.

Respecting teachers’ expertise does not mean ignoring professional misconduct. It means building a system that distinguishes between mistakes, malice and misunderstanding — and is built to handle that.

Taiwan’s education system is buckling under the pressure of demographic shifts, political pressures and long-standing structural inefficiencies. If nothing changes, the result will be fewer passionate teachers, emptier schools and an increasingly transactional view of education. That outcome would serve no one — not students, not parents, not teachers and certainly not the country’s future.",Taipei Times,2025-10-03T16:05:01Z,https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2025/10/04/2003844882,-0.2784313725490196,2025-10-04 00:12:57.072443,0.9999999999999999,"['editorial', 'face', 'mounting', 'teachers', 'issues', 'parents', 'system', 'students', 'education', 'schools', 'educators', 'disciplinary', 'expectations', 'feel', 'ministry', 'address', 'process', 'growing', 'dissatisfaction', 'survey', 'school', 'unrealistic', 'increasingly', 'serve', 'pressure', 'guidelines', 'taiwan’s', 'demographic', 'enrollment', 'day', 'holiday', 'week', 'dozens', 'protested', 'urging']"
'We have lost our world': Plymouth man killed in M5 crash,"The family of a Plymouth man who died at the scene of a four-vehicle crash on the M5 last month have paid tribute to a 'truly wonderful gentleman'.

Sol de Janeiro arrives at Home Bargains - but you can get it for 45p elsewhere,"Sol de Janeiro stands as one of the most coveted body mists on the market and they've finally landed at Home Bargains. The fragrances, which carry an RRP of £25, have been cut down to £19.99 but there's a method to secure them for even less.

Meanwhile on LookFantastic, Cheirosa 71 and 68 have been marked down to £18 but for customers utilising TopCashback that price can plummet to just 45p. For those who are newcomers to both TopCashback and LookFantastic the mists tumble down to 45p following cashback.

Nevertheless those who are existing TopCashback members will secure it for marginally more at £2.40 following cashback.

Cheirosa 71 stands as the best Sol de Janeiro fragrance for the cooler seasons, it's a rich and chocolatey aroma that's composed of caramelised vanilla, toasted macadamia nut and tonka bean. Our team fragrance specialist, Jada Jones, commented: ""This is even better than 62. It's warm and cosy, it's a great option for layering for autumnal scents. I want all of my blankets to smell like this and I feel like compliments are a guarantee.""

There are many rave reviews on LookFantastic, one customer commented: ""I love this body spray. It's especially good for the gourmand lovers and I would put it more into the autumn and winter season. It's lovely sweet and decadent and I think considering the price point it got good longevity and sillage."", reports the Manchester Evening News.

Another customer remarked on its sweetness, stating: ""This scent smelt very sweet, similar to the smell of baked cookies, vanilla and caramel. This particular smell seemed to last longer than the others I have used. Will definitely purchase again.""

One buyer raised concerns about durability, though it's important to note that body mists typically don't have exceptional longevity. They commented: ""I love this scent as it is very vanilla, caramel, gourmand. It is my favourite of the whole collection. It is strong, however it doesn't last for long, hence the 3 stars.""

Another customer shared: ""After trying the smaller bottle I now can't be without the bigger bottle of it because it smells absolutely stunning! I get so many compliments on it whenever I wear it - such a sweet gourmand scent! I love to layer it with the other sol spray too!""

Cheirosa 71 is ideal for sweet fragrance enthusiasts who appreciate products like Lush's Sticky Dates (£28), a sugary body mist that achieved viral fame. It would also appeal to Kayali devotees who desire Vanilla 28 with a hint of chocolate (£39).

Passenger kicks elderly woman on Taiwan subway after being hit by bag over priority seat,"Elderly woman had reportedly hit passenger with bag over refusal to give up priority seat in Taiwan

A passenger was seen kicking an elderly woman on Taiwan’s subway system during a reported dispute over a priority seat.

The violent act was in retaliation for the woman repeatedly hitting the passenger with her bag, according to a now-deleted viral video originally posted on Threads.

Elderly woman seen deliberately hitting passenger with bag

In the clip, the elderly woman, who was standing while carrying multiple bags and an umbrella, was seen deliberately hitting the seated passenger with one of her bags.

In response, the passenger calmly handed a shopping bag to someone for safekeeping.

Just as the elderly woman was about to hit the passenger again, the passenger stood up and aimed a swift kick at the woman, causing her to fall backwards onto the empty seats behind her.

Stunned, she was helped by other commuters, but soon stood up again and stared at the offending passenger, saying, “I want to call the police!”

The passenger then spoke to her in a low voice, saying in English, “You can try one more time.”

Elderly woman in Taiwan says she wanted to sit in the priority seat

When an elderly man approached the elderly woman, she was heard telling him that she was mad at the passenger, as she had wanted to sit in the priority seat.

The senior also said that she was carrying a lot of things and wanted to hang some of them next to the priority seat.

However, the passenger loudly retorted in Mandarin that they wanted to sit there, and she should have driven a car in that case.

The elderly woman soon left, after saying:

Oh, so he’s a man; now I realise he’s a scary person.

The altercation took place on Monday (29 Sept) afternoon on the Taipei Metro, reported Taiwan media platform ETToday.

The elderly woman had reportedly insisted on sitting in the priority seat, despite there being other seats available.

She kept hitting the passenger with her bag, demanding that they give up the seat.

Netizens criticise both elderly woman & passenger

After the video went viral, it sparked a heated online debate.

Many netizens criticised the elderly woman’s behaviour, with some pointing out that she seemed to have targeted the passenger because she believed they were a woman.

One user recalled being pregnant and having the elderly woman hit her with an umbrella, wanting her seat.

Some netizens also slammed the passenger’s response, pointing out that while they were provoked, it was not appropriate to kick her.

Police to identify & summon individuals

Taipei Metro police told ETToday that they were aware of the incident and would review CCTV footage to identify the two individuals.

By fighting on the Metro, the two had violated Taiwan’s Social Order Maintenance Act, it said.

They would both be summoned to provide statements, with each of them facing a maximum fine of NT$18,000 (S$760).

Priority seats for passengers with genuine needs

Taipei Metro police also told Liberty Times that priority seats on trains are designated according to the People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act.

They are intended for all passengers with genuine physical or medical needs, not specifically for the elderly.

They advised passengers who encounter disputes on the Metro to remain calm and avoid confrontation, and press the emergency button or report the incident via phone.

In such a context, he recognised the role of organisations like MSME-PCI in bridging the gap between the government and aspiring entrepreneurs, and helping fulfill the vision of Vikshit Bharat 2047.

He encouraged the youth to leverage the MSME-PCI's Dimapur chapter to gain knowledge and avail themselves of government schemes, fostering self-sustaining and meaningful employment.

The MSME - PCI is a non-profit organization established in 2008 to foster the development and growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises. Its core objective is to empower MSMEs by facilitating access to information, resources, and opportunities. The role includes providing information on government schemes, loan procedures, and necessary support for small businesses. The council also focuses on skill development programs under initiatives like the MSME - PCI Kaushal Vikas Yojana, aiming to create employment opportunities for the unemployed at the grassroots level.

Aligning with the Government of India's ‘Make in India’ initiative, MSME - PCI actively promotes domestic manufacturing and aims to reduce dependence on imports. The council encourages local production, assists MSMEs in improving product quality, and facilitates access to domestic and international markets.

MSME - PCI also addresses challenges faced by MSMEs, such as loan repayment difficulties. The council offers mediation services between banks and borrowers to resolve loan-related issues and encourages responsible borrowing practices.",MorungExpress,2025-10-03T16:04:31Z,https://morungexpress.com/dimapur-gets-msme-pci-office-to-boost-jobs-and-entrepreneurship,0.3333333333333333,2025-10-04 00:13:33.699718,0.7,"['office', 'boost', 'jobs', 'entrepreneurship', 'dimapur', 'msme', 'pci', 'council', 'employment', 'small', 'youth', 'access', 'schemes', 'msmes', 'temjenmenba', 'micro', 'medium', 'enterprises', 'india', 'msme-pci', 'facilitating', ""india's"", 'vision', '2047', 'role', 'development', 'information', 'opportunities', 'loan', 'domestic', 'encourages', 'morung', 'express', 'mla', 'advisor']"

Diwali Gift For Bihar Government Employees As DA Hiked By 3 Percent; Nitish Govt Approves 129 Proposals,"PATNA: Ahead of Diwali and Chhath, the Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government on Friday approved 129 proposals during a cabinet meeting held in Patna. During the meeting, a major relief measure was taken for state employees and pensioners by hiking their dearness allowance (DA) by 3 per cent. With this decision, DA has been raised from 55 per cent to 58 per cent, effective from July 1, 2025. The move, seen as a festive-season gift ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections, will benefit lakhs of government employees, pensioners, and family pensioners.

Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, briefing on the cabinet decision, said, “The state government has approved increasing the dearness allowance from 55 per cent to 58 per cent in line with the Central Government’s decision. This shows our commitment to ensuring that the livelihoods of employees and pensioners are not affected by inflation.”

The hike will put an additional burden of Rs 917.78 crore on the state exchequer in the financial year 2025-26.

Political observers view this announcement as a strategic move by the ruling NDA to consolidate the support of nearly half a million state employees and lakhs of pensioners ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections.

Besides DA, the Bihar government hiked the scholarships for school students.

Nitish Kumar’s cabinet doubled the assistance provided under the Chief Minister’s Boys and Girls Scholarship Scheme, benefitting crores of schoolchildren across the state.

Students in classes 1-4 will now receive Rs 1,200 annually (up from Rs 600), those in classes 5-6 will get Rs 2,400 (up from Rs 1,200), while students in classes 7-10 will receive Rs 3,600 (up from Rs 1,800).

Officials said the move will provide relief to poor and underprivileged students in primary, middle, and secondary schools, and encourage them to continue their education.

With Assembly elections approaching, both measures are seen as strategic populist steps aimed at consolidating the support of state employees and students’ families.

The approval of 129 proposals across departments underscores the government’s bid to push development and welfare initiatives before the elections.",Zee News,2025-10-03T16:04:31Z,https://zeenews.india.com/india/diwali-gift-for-bihar-government-employees-as-da-hiked-by-3-percent-nitish-govt-approves-129-proposals-2967653.html,0.419607843137255,2025-10-04 00:13:36.450696,0.8999999999999999,"['gift', 'hiked', 'govt', 'approves', 'employees', 'bihar', 'da', 'nitish', '129', 'proposals', 'diwali', 'rs', 'state', 'pensioners', 'cent', 'students', 'elections', 'ahead', 'cabinet', 'decision', 'assembly', 'classes', 'patna', 'approved', 'meeting', 'relief', 'dearness', 'allowance', '55', '58', 'lakhs', 'chief', 'government’s', 'strategic', 'support']"
'We've secured N19bn relief for Nigerian pilgrims ahead...,"The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Professor Abdullahi Saleh Usman, says the commission has secured a cost relief of over N19 billion for Nigerian pilgrims in preparation for the 2026 Hajj.

Usman disclosed this while briefing journalists in Kano on Friday upon his return from Saudi Arabia, where he embarked on an emergency visit on September 22 to negotiate improved service delivery and cost efficiency for Nigerian intending pilgrims.

According to him, the relief followed engagements with Saudi partners and executives of State Pilgrims’ Welfare Boards, which resulted in a reduction of over N200,000 per pilgrim across the 66,910 slots allocated to Nigeria.

“This achievement is not just negotiation, but results. It aligns with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda, aimed at easing the burden on our people,” the NAHCON boss said.

He noted that beyond the relief, the trip laid a stronger foundation for the 2026 exercise, with several contracts already signed. These include Masha’ir services with Mashariq Dhahabiyya Company, transport services with Daleel Al-Ma’aleem, and accommodation and feeding services in Madinah’s Markaziyya area at competitive rates.

The chairman added that NAHCON had held frank discussions with the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, drawing from the lessons of the 2025 Hajj to make firm recommendations for better service delivery.

He also announced the inauguration of the 2026 Hajj Tour Operators Screening Committee, saying only qualified operators would be cleared to serve Nigerian pilgrims.

“The days of shortcuts and cutting corners are over,” Usman stressed.

In addition, NAHCON has commenced intensive staff training to sharpen its workforce ahead of the commencement of operations.

On Hajj fares, Usman said the 2026 rates were deliberately announced early to encourage timely payments and smooth planning. The fares include Maiduguri/Yola axis to pay N8,118,333.67; northern states N8,244,813.67 and southern states N8,561,013.67.

He emphasized that by October 8, 2025, states are expected to remit 50 percent of fares to NAHCON to maintain their allocations, while full payment by all pilgrims must be completed by December 31, 2025.

“These deadlines are not just administrative. They are crucial to guarantee early camp bookings, stronger contracts, and efficient services,” he explained.

Usman urged discipline, foresight and cooperation from stakeholders, saying the success of the 2026 Hajj must be built early rather than improvised.",Daily Trust,2025-10-03T16:02:32Z,https://dailytrust.com/weve-secured-n19bn-relief-for-nigerian-pilgrims-ahead-2026-hajj-nahcon-chair/,0.3647058823529412,2025-10-04 00:13:37.691197,0.9999999999999999,"['we’ve', 'n19bn', 'ahead', 'chair', 'hajj', 'nahcon', 'pilgrims', '2026', 'relief', 'nigerian', 'secured', 'usman', 'services', 'chairman', 'saudi', '2025', 'fares', 'early', 'n8', '67', 'states', 'commission', 'nigeria', 'cost', 'service', 'delivery', 'stronger', 'contracts', 'include', 'rates', 'announced', 'operators', 'chief', 'executive', 'officer']"
New Rail line in Mizoram: Overwhelming response to Rajdhani Express,"Guwahati: The recently commissioned Bairabi – Sairang Railway line in Mizoram and the start of freight operations from Molvom in Nagaland have been met with an overwhelming response from both passengers and freight customers, said NF Railway.

According to NF Railway, the new passenger train services, which began operating from Sairang on September 13, 2025, have seen exceptional patronage, with several trains reporting well over full capacity.

The Train No. 20507 (Sairang – Anand Vihar Terminal, Delhi) Rajdhani Express registered an impressive 162.5% occupancy. Its return service, the Train No. 20508 (Anand Vihar Terminal, Delhi – Sairang) Rajdhani Express, also recorded a robust 158.3%. Services connecting to Guwahati and Kolkata have shown similar strength, said an NF Railway statement.

The Sairang – Guwahati Express (Train No. 15609) achieved 100.1% occupancy, including a fully booked sleeper class, while the return service maintained almost 100%. The newly introduced Sairang – Kolkata Express (Train No. 13126) saw almost 100% occupancy, with the return service from Kolkata recording an exceptional 144.8%, it said.

The new railway infrastructure is rapidly becoming a lifeline for trade, significantly easing the lives of North Eastern people by improving supply chains and market access.

Sairang station saw a total of eight rakes unloaded by September 30, 2025. The first rake, arriving on September 14, carried 21 wagons of cement. This was quickly followed by rakes of stone chips, automobiles, Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC), and sand, the statement added.

The new line immediately facilitated the transport of local produce, with the first parcel consignment from Sairang booked on September 19, 2025. Anthurium flowers were successfully transported to Anand Vihar Terminal, Delhi, via the Rajdhani Express parcel van, highlighting the potential for local products to reach wider markets.

Molvom station in Nagaland also commenced freight operations in September. It received its first inward rake, a shipment of 41 wagons of cement from Telangana, on September 24. This was followed by the first outward rake on September 29, loading 42 wagons of stone chips destined for Jirania.",NORTHEAST NOW,2025-10-03T15:58:00Z,https://nenow.in/north-east-news/mizoram/new-rail-line-in-mizoram-overwhelming-response-to-rajdhani-express.html,0.07450980392156858,2025-10-04 00:13:39.081268,0.9999999999999999,"['rail', 'mizoram', 'overwhelming', 'response', 'express', 'rajdhani', 'line', 'sairang', 'railway', 'train', 'guwahati', 'freight', 'nf', '2025', 'anand', 'vihar', 'terminal', 'delhi', 'occupancy', 'return', 'service', 'kolkata', '100', 'rake', 'wagons', 'operations', 'molvom', 'nagaland', 'services', 'exceptional', 'statement', 'booked', 'station', 'rakes', 'cement']"

Reviews are rolling in for Taylor Swift's 'Life of a Showgirl' album. Here's what the critics are saying.,"WASHINGTON — Taylor Swift’s 12th studio album, ""The Life of a Showgirl,"" has finally arrived.
The album, which Swift describes as a look inside her life during her record-breaking Eras Tour, features twelve tracks and is produced by Max Martin and Shellback.
""This album is really about what was going on in my life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,"" Swift said when announcing the project on the New Heights podcast, hosted by her now-fiancé, Travis Kelce, and his brother Jason, back in August. ""I’m so proud of it. It just comes from the most infectiously, joyful, wild dramatic place I was in my life.""
In an Instagram post shared by Swift Friday, just after the album released, she wrote, ""I can't tell you how proud I am to share this with you, an album that just feels so right. A forever thank you goes out to my mentors and friends Max and Shellback for helping me paint this self portrait.""
As fans dive into the record, critics are weighing in on Swift’s latest reinvention. Here’s what they’re saying.
Billboard
""The Life of a Showgirl "" isn’t a ""1989 Pt. II,"" according to Billboard’s Jason Lipshutz. Instead, it’s a collection of tracks with varying emotions.
“Bangers for Adults,” Lipshutz called it.
The opening track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is one he predicted will be a standout hit.
""‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is a stick of dynamite opening the album, and sounds like it will join her collection of smashes in no time,” he said.
“The limit does not exist to how high Swift can keep soaring — anytime her downfall (or even a notable downturn) has been predicted, she climbs higher and winks at her naysayers. By pivoting back to pop anthems with humor, empathy, a little fury and a lot of wisdom, Swift ensures that ascent will continue.”
Rolling Stone
Maya Georgi of Rolling Stone rated the album five stars, stating Swift “stepped into uncharted territory.”
Georgi also commented on the album’s sole feature, Sabrina Carpenter, who joins Swift on the title track.
“It’s almost as if Swift is passing the torch to the next generation of showgirls as she takes a bow. Could it be her final one? Well, no. This showgirl won’t be left for dead; she’s immortal now. ‘We will see you next time,’ Swift promises as an audience cheers. After all, despite the rock on her finger, Swift is married to the hustle — and with an album as good as this one, she might even try to outdo herself, again. That’s just show business for you.”
The New York Times
Jon Caramanica described TLoaS as “a catchy and substantive but unflashy album” that “takes the songwriting intimacy of her Folklore/Evermore era and renders it with more clarity and oomph.”
“Swift is hungry — hungry to move on from the battles of her past and into the embraces of her future. That sentiment is all over her 12th original album, a deceptively modest set of songs about the facade of fame, and what it takes to scrape it away and claw past it. Swift has been pop’s alpha figure for more than a decade, a spot she’s clung to ruthlessly. Showgirl isn’t precisely a goodbye to all that, but it does cast a wary eye on her past while greeting her future with a glee that verges on the unbridled.”
Comparing the new project to Swift's past albums, Caramanica wrote, ""Showgirl isn’t a hard pivot like Red or Reputation, risky-in-their-moment albums that expanded Swift’s musical palette.”
Based on its subject matter, ""it feels most kin to Reputation, but her collaborators aren’t slathering her in gloss or skronk here, instead letting her songwriting breathe,"" he added.
Variety
Chris Willman of Variety celebrated the album’s unexpectedly light tone, noting it feels like a full embrace of joy and ease in love in a contrast from past records.
“And nobody does it better, now or at any recent time, when it comes to delivering world-dominating pop that feels all the feels and doesn’t stint on the thoughts, either,” he wrote.
“That those feels are now very much on the sunny side is not a huge surprise, but it’s still just slightly startling how light-hearted the near-entirety of her 12th album, 'The Life of a Showgirl,' is.”
He added that ""love seems easy-fought"" on the record.
Still, the album includes a few sharper moments, according to Willman.
“There is shade amid all this sunshine, mind you… as in, the thrown kind,” Willman noted in his review. “If you haven’t yet heard about the pair of diss tracks that arrive as prominently as banner headlines in the middle of the album, ‘Father Figure’ and ‘Actually Romantic,’ you probably will soon enough.”
He singled out ""Wood"" as a surprise, comparing it to a ""Jackson 5 song in everything but name, credit or composition, with a funk-pop guitar riff classic-sounding enough that I had to double-check the credits to make sure it wasn’t a Motown sample.""
Los Angeles Times
Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times called the album an ""immaculate act of damage control,"" following the release of the dense ""Tortured Poets Department"" in 2024.
“In contrast with the bleary Tortured Poets, which yielded only one pop-radio monster in the Hot 100-topping ‘Fortnight,’ Showgirl is likely to spin off several, not least the album’s lead single, ‘The Fate of Ophelia,’ which rides an irresistible new wave groove that evokes the veteran hookmeisters of Eurythmics.”
He wrote about seeing the record as a tonal shift, writing ""Showgirl feels like a retreat from the vivid bloodletting of Tortured Poets, which captured a woman whose one-of-one success had emboldened her to speak certain toxic truths.""
Still, he critiqued some of the romantic storytelling on the album: “There’s no denying that Swift’s lyrics about love here lack the kind of depth she’s mined in tunes thought to have been inspired by the dastardly likes of John Mayer and Matty Healy.”
Wood also commented on ""Actually Romantic,"" which he interprets as a possible response to Charli XCX and the complicated history the two singers share.
“Swift gets off some funny lines about chihuahuas and cocaine but totally forgoes the sense of empathy that made her such an icon to every pop songwriter who’s come up behind her.”
He opened his review with a sharp summary: “After the mess, the mop-up.” In many ways, ""The Life of a Showgirl"" seems to be just that, offering a sweeping reset that’s still dazzling in its own way.",KTVB 7,2025-10-03T15:58:24Z,https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/nation-world/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-reviews/507-83d94be5-0a3c-455c-bac5-141f21dce6a2,0.4274509803921569,2025-10-04 00:14:01.348626,0.9999999999999999,
YieldBoost WMS From 0.5% To 16.7% Using Options,"Shareholders of Advanced Drainage Systems Inc (Symbol: WMS) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.5% annualized dividend yield can sell the March 2026 covered call at the $155 strike and collect the premium based on the $10.70 bid, which annualizes to an additional 16.2% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 16.7% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $155 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but WMS shares would have to climb 7.8% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 15.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Advanced Drainage Systems Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for WMS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 0.5% annualized dividend yield.

Below is a chart showing WMS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155 strike highlighted in red:

The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2026 covered call at the $155 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $155. (Do most options expire worthless? This and six other common options myths debunked). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Advanced Drainage Systems Inc (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $142.04) to be 42%.

Best West Coast small towns to live in
Best West Coast small towns to live in
The American dream of buying a home in a quaint small town is alive and well. In 2023, more people moved to small towns than to cities, and the Census Bureau reported in 2024 that some of the fastest-growing communities in the country are considered exurban (i.e., well outside of major metropolitan areas).
Though 2023 marked the first year since the 1970s that migration to small towns exceeded migration to urban areas, this trend had been on the rise in recent years in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasingly common practice of remote work. Young Americans have been at the forefront of the shift. A report from the University of Virginia released in 2024 shows that, since 2020, adults aged 25 to 44 have increasingly left major metropolises to settle down in either rural counties or cities with fewer than 1 million residents.
If you're looking to follow suit and relocate to the West Coast, this list offers plenty of attractive options. Stacker referenced Niche's 2025 Best Places to Live and filtered the results to the West Coast and then narrowed them further to places with fewer than 5,000 residents. Niche calculated the best places to live based on cost, safety, weather quality, access to healthy living, and other factors.
Whether you're considering a move or just want a peek into small-town life, this list will certainly inspire some home searches.

Rancho Santa Fe's history dates back to a time before California's statehood, when Mexico's governor Pio Pico awarded the area in a land grant to San Diego's first mayor, Juan Osuna, in 1840. In the early 1900s, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway company bought the land and planted eucalyptus trees for later use as railroad ties. After that experiment failed, the company decided to turn the land into a residential development, and Rancho Santa Fe, as we know it, was born.
#14. Lexington Hills, California
- Population: 2,777
Situated between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz, Lexington Hills is a small community of less than 3,000 people. While it's certainly not a cheap place to live—the median home value is $1.2 million—residents appreciate the area's rural feel, which includes miles of hiking and equestrian trails.
#13. Ross, California
- Population: 2,626
First incorporated in 1908, Ross is a quaint town in Marin County governed by a five-person town council and a town manager.

#12. Belvedere, California
- Population: 2,415
Belvedere, proudly proclaiming itself one of the smallest and oldest cities in California, was first incorporated in 1896. The San Francisco Bay borders the town on three sides. In fact, the 0.5-square-mile city is technically composed of two islands and a lagoon, giving the homes here unbeatable views.
#11. Woodway, Washington
- Population: 1,174
Just 20 miles north of Seattle, you'll find Woodway, self-described as ""the quiet place."" Residents love to walk and bike around the evergreen-lined lanes and local parks. The town's history dates back to 1912 when David Whitcomb Sr. developed 400 acres into modest, country-style homes.
#10. Loyola, California
- Population: 3,883
Like the neighboring towns of Mountain View and Los Altos, Loyola is an affluent community. As of September 2025, Zillow puts the median home value at over $4.5 million.

#9. Del Monte Forest, California
- Population: 3,576
This unincorporated community in Monterey County is known for its picturesque views. Visitors might want to spend a leisurely afternoon checking out all the sights on 17-Mile Drive, including the Lone Cypress—a rugged, salt air-pruned tree clinging to a craggy rock in the bay—and the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links course. Though Pebble Beach is technically a separate community, it sits within Del Monte Forest.
#8. Monte Sereno, California
- Population: 3,459
When a community began forming in what is now Monte Sereno in the early 1900s, the area was rural and agricultural.
