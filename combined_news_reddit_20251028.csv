SPY,Help me understand why I shouldn't sell my long term rental and just sell covered calls on SPY,"\*\*reposting here since it was deleted from r/realestateinvesting Have had a rental home operating for a little under 10 years. It is a 2 bed/1bath at 1200 square feet in what I would call a B- neighborhood. The home had a 15 year mortgage taken out in 2012 and has about $15k in principle left. Rental income is currently at $1495/month. averaging the various online real estate sites and looking at recent sales I'd estimate the current sales value at around $225k. The roof, HVAC, and fence are all less than 5 years old, so if we do continue to rent, we should be clear of any large CAPEX items for several years. When we pay off the home in 2027, assuming we are still at $1495 per month, after taxes and insurance it comes out to $977 (again, assuming T&I doesnt keep rising at a ridiculous rate). Accounting for management, vacancy, repairs and future CAPEX I am calculating around $560 per month. Assuming 2% annual appreciation, that adds another $375/month (first year) for a total of $960/month. If I were to sell the home today at the $225k, after realtor fees, depreciation recapture, taxes, mortgage pay off, capital gains, minor repairs etc, I am coming up with around $175k in cash. Now for my theory: say I take this $175k and add some savings to get to $203k so I can buy 300 shares of SPY at its current trading price of $677. Tracking this for a bit, I can sell 0.25 delta covered calls that are one week out for around $1.75 each. This would put the gross income at $525/week, not accounting for any appreciation. I don't need to show the math to prove that this comes out to higher than the $960/month from my rental. two outcomes of this weekly position: 1. SPY increases past my strike. I roll the option into the following week, profit is locked up in the sell/buy but still a net increase. 2. SPY trades below my strike by whatever amount and I just keep the premium. There are of course pros and cons to both options. An obvious risk to point out with the CC option is that the market could plummet at any point and my $200k could fall to $100k or lower. If, in theory, I do not plan to cash out this position and spend it anytime within the next couple decades (similar to holding the cash in the rental equity) I'm not concerned over that other than the income from the premiums would shrink as well. There are also obvious cons to the rental that are not captured in the $960 above as well. A bad tenant, liability, extended vacancy, reduction in rent (probably tied to the market 'crash' scenario above) all could impact the profitability. I have also looked into selling this property or pulling a HELOC to buy other rentals. At the current values and interest rates I just can't get any properties I come across to make sense at all.

VOO,VOO and chill in retirement,"For those who like this approach, what's your plan in retirement? Say you have $1 mm in VOO, in today's prices you would hold 1626 shares. Let's say you need $4000\mo from your investment account to fund your living expenses on top of your ss income. You would need to sell 6.5 shares monthly or 78 shares yearly to meet this requirement. If voo grows at 14%, your growth will outpace your sells (228 new vs 78 sold) which is sustainable. But if the market drops like in the 2008 gfc, let's say your shares drop to $400 each, you'll need to sell 120 shares to meet your income needs. In this scenario your 1626 shares drop to 1506 shares. And each year until recovery your share count will drop. A 5 year recovery could mean a loss of 600 shares dropping to 1000 total, a 40% decline in your nest egg. Alternatively, would you consider investing in something like spyi instead? In today's prices you would hold 19,230 shares with $1mm. That would generate around $10,000\month in income. If the market tanked as in the above scenario, and say your investment income dropped by half, you would still have $5000\month investment income, without having to sell anything while still invested in a sp500 fund... Just like VOO. And if spyi continues in recovery to pay 12% while the sp500 grows at 14%, there should be no nav erosion either. Thoughts?

VOO,stop losses in the scenario of a big pullback,"A question for those who are more experienced than I. What is advised in terms of your stop losses for a large VOO holding in the case of a 15% pullback in the market? It seems, if you crunch the numbers, it would be wise to have a stop loss at 10% for the whole account, in the event of a catastrophe, and then try to buy back at the dip. Of course, there would be a tax situation, but that would only be relevant for gains, and I only have two years of gains with my set it and forget it VOO portfolio, and so my tax hit wouldn't be huge (this would change after years of course).

SPY,"Short, medium, and long term after a crash","I looked into what happened after the 2008 crash. I am just using SPY (S&P 500) and VDC (consumer staples) as examples here: you could use VTI or VT for broad market indexes and there are other ""stable"" sectors, like utilities, that this analysis should still hold true for. While both SPY and VDC fell in the crash, VDC fell less. While both recovered after the crash, VDC recovered a year and a half earlier. And while the S&P 500 has by far the better long term performance it took SPY well over a decade to catch back up to VDC. Bonds of course fell by less, holding their value better in the three years after the crash. VDC caught back up to BND in fall 2012, SPY caught back up to BND a year later. So there's three time ranges: - short term BND preserved spending power during and immediately - VDC recovered faster and provided better growth over the next ten years - long term S&P 500 dominates Therefore I'm thinking of allocating something like this: 40% VTI (VT if you want int'l) 30% VDC and similar 30% BND and similar (TIPS, bills) I think this might be better than 60/40 because it uses VDC to better fund the decade after a crash, and although VDC is slower growing, overall 70% equities is still pretty aggressive.

QQQ,QQQ Proxy Voting - my research & conclusions,"\[Cross-posted to r/ETFs\] I just spent the past couple of hours researching this after being bombarded with an insane amount of mail from Invesco.

SPY,Setting Sail for Plunder: $GLD DD and YOLO,"Ahoy me hearties, I'm the pirate DarklyAdonic; a famed plunderer of Kohls during July meme mania. I’ve sailed over from my Den looking for new crew among you gambling degenerates. We'll be embarking on a voyage for every pirate’s favorite plunder: Gold ($GLD). Wen the average bagholder is still waiting for for OPEN to get back to $10, you could be swimming in a bathtub full of bullion like Scrooge McDuck. **The Background:** To start, let me tell you a legend of time long past. A time when the world was a troubled place. High inflation was squeezing the common man dry and making living hard.

SPY,YOLOing 50k into The $HI Acquisition Play,"Alright you fellow degenerates and gamblers, gather round. Forget Nvidia AI GPUs for a sec, I found the ultimate boomer stock with the most WSB energy imaginable: **Hillenbrand ($HI)**. Yeah, I know, sounds like a law firm or a casket company.

Because some **private equity giga-chads (Apollo, Lone Star, Stellex)** are sniffing around like wolves at a nursing home buffet. Here’s the kicker: * EBITDA = \~$418M * Normal boring industrial buyouts go for \~9–10× EBITDA * Do the math: that’s a buyout price of \~$3.7–$4.0B EV → translates to about **$33–$36 per share**. * Stock is sitting at $26.6. Bruh. Now the fun part. Some **smart money lad yeeted $1.5M+ into $HI $30 calls expiring in November** right before close on Friday. So we’ve got: * Real buyers (Apollo don’t mess around). * Real EBITDA math saying $33–36/share is the sweet spot. * A PE bidding war. * A random whale throwing $1.5M into illiquid calls like it’s a DraftKings parlay. My dumb brain translation: either this dies in a ditch and we all lose money, or we get the juiciest $7–10/share tendie pop when a deal hits.

Every time this stock does that, it bounces back hard right before earnings. They’ve been adding new stuff fast — not just hair loss or penis meds anymore. They’re pushing weight loss, mental health, women’s health, menopause stuff, even some new telehealth categories. Basically they’re trying to become the “Amazon of health subscriptions.” The short interest is insane (30%+). If this catches any momentum, shorts will have to cover and it could send this thing right back to 55–60 easy. If they surprise on earnings again, it could go full launch mode to 70+. I also think shorts will start to de risk entering earnings if we close above $51-$52 area going into earnings which can drive the price up.

But except for Meta, Google and Apple don’t have social platforms to tie AR into. Meta is bleeding billions on legless VR Sims. Apple’s Vision Pro flop shows that having the social layer is critical. Stock comp was a headwind, but layoffs and buybacks are stabilizing things. User growth is slowing but that’s true for all social media platforms. SNAP has 900 million monthly active users. The key is jumping onto the next big thing that feeds into revenue. CEO Evan Spiegel has majority voting rights. Which means if he wakes up one day and decides to turn the ghost into a furry NFT, we’re screwed. Expect some WSB level decisions at times. Bottom line: SNAP is sitting near its 5-year low, the market has priced in zero upside, and the next catalyst (Specs) is massive. From here, this can only go up. Not financial advice. I am jacked to the tits. Position: 81600 shares bought over the last 2 weeks.",0.85,Positive,"The post argues for a large SNAP long based on a coming AR 'Specs' launch in 2026, cites a multi-year low price and potential upside catalysts, and notes buybacks/cost cuts as fundamentals—the tone is highly bullish and conviction is strong."

But this new sentiment is truly fun to watch. I can’t wait until the next down trend when Gold and International provide literally no safety. I’ll continue buying VTI and FSKAX on schedule per usual. Also, has anyone actually read the books written by the namesake of this group? He listed plenty of reasons why he doesn’t believe international is necessary, and none of them have to do with “recency bias” or “performance chasing”. Furthermore gold is nothing more than the original bitcoin, a speculative asset with no real value. Good luck to all those buying at these prices.",-0.54,Negative,"The post derides gold and international hedges as speculative and unnecessary while endorsing US equity funds (VTI/FSKAX), indicating a negative stance toward non-domestic hedges and a preference for domestic equities."
VOO,"In investing, what are the advantages and disadvantages of growth vs. dividend investing?","If you've ever been to r/Bogleheads or r/dividends, you've seen two ends of a spectrum where both are convinced the other side are idiots.

VOO,I lost almost all because I am dumb,"Hello Guys, Today I want to tell you one of the biggest mistakes in my life.

SPY,Did the math on ETF vs individual stock investing and the result was surprising,"Please feel free to pick apart my math because I didn't find a great formula for calculating the amount w/DRIP after 10 years to take into account average dividend growth rates as well, but it scarcely seems to matter when the [ETF #s get compared to individual stocks](https://imgur.com/a/Nh52dCb) over the same time period. Bare in mind, I did these calculations several months ago and added a couple on the back end that I was interested in for the sake of comparison, as you can see, but it didn't matter how I structured it. If you take the [most common top 10 holdings of well known ETFs ](https://imgur.com/a/c8T0APf)and diversify with just those 10 you should have beaten SPY and QQQ. The caveat being, of course, that no one had something like NVDA in their top 10 in 2015 but many of the other companies have been mainstays for >5 years. So you would have to occasionally rearrange your portfolio to accommodate the top 10 for your preferred investing style, but likely not by much. The second thing I found interesting was [how ""dividend-focused"" ETFs performed ](https://imgur.com/a/DQwfR36)relative to those that are tracking specific indices or sectors. Despite having large holdings in ""growth"" companies that offer very low dividends, too. I think this reaffirmed my choice to use SCHD to hedge against market downturns but if I were 100% growth focused I wouldn't use that one either. I debate the strengths and weaknesses of dividend focused investing routinely, but I think the conclusion is that by the very nature of offering large dividends those companies are going to be growing more slowly. However, by common sense and the data, those companies tend to also be more stable during market corrections. So if you lean bearish then higher investment in those types of companies (not necessarily the ETFs) could still play to your favor. Anyway, all critiques are welcome and if you can provide experience or data that contradicts my assumptions or highlights important points that I missed then please do.

VOO,Need advice on investments with my advisor,"Hello! Throw away account for anonymity. Sort of a long story but here it goes. I have been saving/investing for about 18 years mainly focusing on my employer's 401k program. About two years ago, I switched jobs and had to decide what to do with my 401k, if anything. I have had a financial advisor pretty much the whole time whom I have been paying a flat fee per year (completely worth it in my case imo). To give a bit of pertinent info, the advisor is also a close friend whom I trust and is a CFP. When asked what shall I do with my 401k, he took his time and was going back and forth whether I should just leave it or roll it into my new job's 401k program. We also discussed opening an IRA with his company (a large and relatively well known wealth management company). He wasn't pushing me either way, just laying out info and options. Although I had been saving and investing, I really didn't know much as far as finances go so I was hoping for guidance on this decision. We ended up opening an IRA with about 80% of the old 401k and put the rest into the 401k with my new job(target date fund). Again, he is a close friend whom I have trusted. He said it would be an actively managed account and he would charge me the lowest fee he could which is 0.5%. I have learned this is actually pretty good as far as AUM fees go (I realize this is highly debatable) but I was comfortable with this as I trust him. Fast forward 2 years later and here we are. I have been really digging deep (at least to me lol) to learn as much as I could about investing and finance. I also have since realized I would like to retire as soon as is feasible, which likely will not be for at least about 10 years, more likely 15. But what I have learned is that it is extremely hard to beat returns on an index fund such as VOO and others. And on top of that, the fees are much better (my 401k has a fee of 0.08%). I know that there are different risk levels and that will determine returns as well. I have always been a moderately aggressive to aggressive investor based on his firm's terminology. The IRA currently is 80% equity, 12.5% fixed income, 5% alternative and 2.5% cash. I am trying to compare apples-to-apples to my 401K to see if I made the right choice as I suspect I may not have. The **401K rate of return is: 17.27% ytd and 15.02% for just the year 2024**. I used these timeframes as the account has only been open about 2 years and when I tried asking for the return rate for 1/1/24-10/19/25 it said 35.2% which didn't seem right. The **IRA rate of return is: 13.38% ytd and 11.98% for 2024**. This is before fees I assume so take off another 0.5% plus fees for the various funds (the portfolio has no less than 25 positions). I would like to stick with him at least as far as the flat fee annual financial planning and guidance goes but I am having second thoughts on the investments. So my questions are: 1. Does this look like a fair comparison? 2. If so, is it a good idea to leave these investments in the IRA? I am not looking forward to the conversation of taking out my funds but I definitely will if I determine it is in the best interest for me and my family.

VOO,What is the end goal?,"I’m a 36 year old male planning to retire around 75, which means I have 40 years of investing ahead of me. No matter how many videos I watch or books I read, everything seems to point to index investing as the best approach for regular investors which I completely agree with. The advice to invest frequently and consistently for the long term makes sense to me. That said, if I’m planning to invest for another 40 years, wouldn’t it be better to focus on indexes like the S&P 100 (SP100), QQQ, or SCHG instead of something like VTI? These cap weighted indexes effectively ‘flush out’ weaker-\] performing companies over time, so theoretically, they’re self-cleansing. If that’s the case, what’s the point of investing in the Total stock market index? I understand that QQQ and SP100 might have assets with high valuations or bubbles that could eventually burst. However, if I stick to dollar cost averaging for four decades, wouldn’t these kinds of investments still outperform broader options like VTI in the long run? When I backtested performance from 1999 onward, I saw that QQQ significantly outperformed SPY over 26 years. I know past performance doesn’t guarantee future returns, but if we’re all betting on the growth of the U.S. economy, aren’t we essentially playing the same game? I also get the argument for diversification through VT or the inclusion of bonds for stability.

VOO,Roth IRA. Makes this a post where everyone educates everyone!,So here’s the deal. I’m 22 with a 401k 100% rolled into a 500 index fund with an expense ratio of .05 (maybe a little higher than others but a good start to retirement investing I think). Wanted to set up another retirement account so I decided on a Roth IRA for the tax benefits. I have a hysa and an emergency fund account already. I want my Roth to be invested into solely into index/mutual funds and etfs. I can max out the account right now but I’m in a dilemma of where I break up the money into. I’m leaning towards QQQ but seen QQQM has a lower expense ratio. I think tech is going to be revolutionary in 10 years so that’s a no brainer to invest in that. I love VOO but I don’t want to over lap since I’m in the 500 index fund already.

SPY,Should my parents' investments have doubled over the past 5 years?,"Hello, My parents have someone who manages their money and I've just started learning about finance myself.
